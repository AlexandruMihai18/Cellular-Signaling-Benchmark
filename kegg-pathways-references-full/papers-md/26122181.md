## ESR1 mutations—a mechanism for acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer

### Rinath Jeselsohn, Gilles Buchwalter, Carmine De Angelis, Myles Brown and Rachel Schiff

#### Abstract | Approximately 70% of breast cancers are oestrogen receptor α (ER) positive, and are, therefore, treated with endocrine therapies. However, about 25% of patients with primary disease and almost all patients with metastases will present with or eventually develop endocrine resistance. Despite the magnitude of this clinical challenge, the mechanisms underlying the development of resistance remain largely unknown. In the past 2 years, several studies unveiled gain-of-function mutations in *ESR1*, the gene encoding the ER, in approximately 20% of patients with metastatic ER-positive disease who received endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. These mutations are clustered in a ‘hotspot’ within the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the ER and lead to ligand-independent ER activity that promotes tumour growth, partial resistance to endocrine therapy, and potentially enhanced metastatic capacity; thus, ER LBD mutations might account for a mechanism of acquired endocrine resistance in a substantial fraction of patients with metastatic disease. In general, the absence of detectable *ESR1* mutations in patients with treatment-naive disease, and the correlation between the frequency of patients with tumours harbouring these mutations and the number of endocrine treatments received suggest that, under selective treatment pressure, clonal expansion of rare mutant clones occurs, leading to resistance. Preclinical and clinical development of rationale-based novel therapeutic strategies that inhibit these ER mutants has the potential to substantially improve treatment outcomes. We discuss the contribution of *ESR1* mutations to the development of acquired resistance to endocrine therapy, and evaluate how mutated ER can be detected and targeted to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes.

### Introduction

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease comprising different clinical, histopathological, and molecular subtypes. Molecular studies have identified five main intrinsic subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, normal-like and basal-like breast cancers.¹ Approximately 70% of breast cancers express oestrogen receptor α (ER). ER-positive (ER+) tumours are primarily of the luminal molecular subtypes—either the more-differentiated, indolent, and endocrine-therapy-sensitive luminal A subtype, or the more-aggressive and relatively endocrine-resistant luminal B subtype.²⁻⁴ A large number of clinical and experimental studies established the fundamental role of the ER and its oestrogen ligands in normal mammary gland development, and the aetiology and progression of breast cancer.⁵⁻⁸

The ER, encoded by the *ESR1* gene, is predominantly a nuclear protein that functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor. It belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily,⁹ and shares the typical structural configuration and functional aspects associated with its family members. Specifically, the ER consists of two transcriptional activation domains: the N-terminal ligand-independent activation function domain (AF-1), and the C-terminal ligand-dependent AF-2 domain. The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ER also resides in its C-terminal region, and the DNA-binding and hinge domains are positioned in the central core of the protein.⁷ The ER–ligand complex binds directly to a specific DNA sequence called the oestrogen response element (ERE), and interacts with co-activator or co-repressor proteins to regulate the transcription of oestrogen-responsive genes that are important in various physiological and pathological processes, including tumorigenesis and tumour progression (this mechanism is reported as ‘ER classic genomic activity’).¹⁰ Furthermore, the ER–ligand complex can also function by tethering to other transcription factors, such as activator protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), to mediate ERE-independent signalling by regulating the transcriptional activity of these factors and their responsive genes.¹¹,¹² This nonclassical ER transcriptional regulation mechanism was shown to be augmented in ligand-independent conditions under the stimulation of growth factors.¹³ Of note, the ER also has extranuclear activities that are less-well understood, and involve its interaction with various tyrosine kinase receptors (such as growth factor

**Key points**

- Over the past 18 months, recurrent activating mutations within the oestrogen receptor α (ER) LBD have been detected in 15–20% of patients with metastatic ER-positive endocrine-resistant breast cancer
- The ER LBD mutations confer constitutive ligand-independent activity and are relatively resistant to tamoxifen and fulvestrant treatment
- These mutations in the gene encoding the ER, ESR1, are detected mainly in metastatic tumours, implicating the clonal selection of these mutations as the mechanism of resistance to therapy
- Structural studies have shown that the ER LBD mutations lead to ligand-independent stabilization of the LBD in the agonistic conformation
- To study the clonal evolution and discern the full genetic complexity and clinical significance of the ESR1 mutations, new sensitive sequencing technologies will need to be applied
- Potential strategies to overcome ER-related endocrine resistance include high-dose fulvestrant and tamoxifen, inhibitors of ER co-activator proteins, novel SERDs and SERMs, and other agents targeting the ER signalling axis

of patients with metastatic breast cancer.²⁶,²⁷ However, in most of endocrine-resistant cases, ER continues to be expressed and active, thus enabling response to sequential multiple lines of endocrine treatments in the advanced metastatic setting.²⁸,²⁹ This perpetual ER activity, even during endocrine therapy, is mediated by several mechanisms, including increased expression of the ER itself,³⁰ or of its co-activators.³¹ Bidirectional crosstalk between ER and growth-factor receptors, or cellular and/or stress-related kinase pathways, resulting in increased phosphorylation levels and activity of ER and ER co-regulators, has also emerged as a key mechanism that maintains ligand-independent activation of the pathway and thus mediates resistance to various endocrine therapies.³¹⁻³³ Hyperactivation of these kinase pathways and amplification and/or overexpression of cell-cycle regulators or antiapoptotic factors can provide alternative proliferative and survival signalling for cancer cells independent of the ER.²⁵ Finally, a role for various components of the tumour microenvironment and additional host-related factors has also been recognized in endocrine resistance.²⁴,²⁵ Despite the advances in understanding the molecular biology of breast cancer, mechanisms of clinical resistance, mainly acquired resistance, remain largely unknown and are, therefore, difficult to manage.

Large-scale genomics efforts, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, have led to new insights in the landscape and complexity of breast cancer genomics and heterogeneity.³⁴ Results from the TCGA show that luminal primary breast cancers harbour the most diverse and recurrent mutations; however, the overall mutation rate in luminal cancers is lower compared with the basal-like and HER2-enriched subtypes.³⁴ Of note, among luminal tumours, only eight genes were found to be mutated at a frequency greater than 5% (*PIK3CA*, *TP53*, *MAP3K1*, *MAP2K4*, *GATA3*, *MLL3*, *CDH1*, and *PTEN*).³⁴ Despite the central role of the ER in luminal tumours, updated TCGA data for 962 breast cancer samples indicated that *ESR1* mutations were present in only 0.5% of cases, and *ESR1* amplification was detected in 2.6% of the cases.³⁵ These results are consistent with previous studies from the 1990s that also showed the rarity of *ESR1* mutations in primary breast cancers.³⁶,³⁷ Thus, results from primary untreated tumours do not support the notion that *ESR1* mutations are major drivers of carcinogenesis. By contrast, recent reports on metastatic ER+ breast cancers reveal a higher frequency of *ESR1* mutations.³⁸⁻⁴² Strikingly, the vast majority of these alterations are missense mutations clustered within the ER LBD that lead to ligand-independent constitutive activation of the receptor. This Review summarizes *ESR1*-related genomic alterations, their functional characteristics and potential involvement in endocrine resistance, with a focus on the recently identified, recurrent, missense, activating mutations that affect the ER LBD. We also elaborate on sensitive methods for detection of *ESR1* mutations, the prognostic and predictive implications of such mutations, and new therapeutic strategies to circumvent endocrine resistance resulting from mutation of the ER LBD.

receptors) and other signalling molecules to rapidly activate their downstream signalling pathways that promote cell proliferation and survival.¹⁴

Owing to the central role of the ER in breast cancer, the inhibition of this pathway through endocrine therapy has become the mainstay of prevention and treatment of ER+ breast cancers at all stages of the disease.¹⁵⁻¹⁹ Notably, ER status is a strong predictor of response to endocrine therapy.⁷ Different types of endocrine therapy exist: direct inhibition of ER by selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) with mixed agonistic/antagonistic activities, such as tamoxifen;²⁰ promotion of ER degradation using selective ER degraders (SERDs) that are more potent anti-oestrogens, such as fulvestrant;²¹ and ligand deprivation via blockade of oestrogen production using aromatase inhibitors²² or through ovarian suppression.²³ In the early disease setting, endocrine treatments reduce the risk of recurrence by nearly 50%, and in metastatic disease, these treatments remain the most-effective treatment for ER+ disease.¹⁶ Despite the effectiveness of endocrine therapy, intrinsic (*de novo*) and acquired endocrine resistance continues to be an important clinical challenge in the management of breast cancer.¹⁹ About 25% of patients who present with ER+ early stage disease will develop resistance within the first 10 years after diagnosis, manifested as recurrences either during or after adjuvant endocrine treatments.¹⁶ In the metastatic setting, endocrine treatments lead to initial tumour regression in only ~30% of patients, and inevitably, resistant disease develops in almost all patients, driving disease progression and eventually resulting in death.

## Mechanisms of ER resistance

A further understanding of the complex biology of the ER indicates multiple mechanisms that could underlie endocrine resistance. Of note, each mechanism can operate as the sole mechanism or in concert with other mechanisms—that is, they are not mutually exclusive.²⁴ These mechanisms have been extensively reviewed elsewhere²⁴,²⁵ and thus are discussed only briefly herein.

Loss of ER expression, which could account for endocrine resistance, has been observed in ~15–20%

# ESR1 genomic alterations in breast cancer

In general, acquired resistance to various targeted therapies is attributable to secondary genetic aberrations that alter the target protein, additional components of its pathway, or other compensatory pathways, thus counteracting the inhibitory effect of the drug. Several types of ESR1-related genomic abnormalities have been described in breast cancer, including copy-number changes (especially gene amplification), genomic rearrangements, and missense point mutations.

## ESR1 amplifications

Gene amplification is a mechanism by which certain cancer cells increase the expression of genes that can provide a survival advantage. The resulting overexpression of the amplified gene product has been described as a mechanism for treatment failure and acquired resistance in multiple cancer types. Interestingly, in prostate cancer the amplification of the androgen receptor was reported in seven of 23 (30%) tumours that recurred during androgen-deprivation therapy, but in none of the matched pretreatment specimens, suggesting that AR amplification might be the mechanism underlying disease recurrence. Studies of the prevalence and functional consequences of ESR1 amplifications have provided conflicting data. Initial studies of ESR1 amplifications in early stage breast cancer reported a relatively high amplification rate of ~20%. In these studies, ESR1 amplification was correlated with high ER expression levels, response to tamoxifen, and favourable outcomes. However, other groups that have studied several thousands of cases were not able to reproduce these results. In these later studies, the ESR1-amplification frequency was 0–23% when fluorescence *in situ* hybridization (FISH) was used for detection, and less than 5% when biochemical assays (array competitive genomic hybridization [CGH], multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification [MLPA], and quantitative PCR [qPCR]) were used. In general, the amplification frequency is highly concordant between the different studies that used biochemical assays, whereas considerable variability exists among the studies that used FISH. This variability might be due to different protocols, scoring systems, and the possibility of FISH-analysis artefacts owing to accumulation of nuclear ESR1 transcripts in cells with high levels of ER expression—which might be easily misinterpreted as gene amplification. More recently, studies using next-generation sequencing have detected an ESR1-amplification rate of approximately 2% in both primary and metastatic breast tumours, indicating that ESR1 amplification might not have a major role in the development of endocrine resistance. Nonetheless, data from a small study of neoadjuvant endocrine treatment have demonstrated the acquisition of a new amplicon containing ESR1 after 6 months of treatment. Furthermore, Li *et al.* have also reported a ligand-independent tumour growth driven by ESR1 gene amplification in a xenograft model established using cancer cells from a patient with ER+ metastatic endocrine-refractory tumours. Thus, the clinical significance of ESR1 amplifications in early and recurrent disease remains debatable and somewhat unclear.

## ESR1 genomic rearrangements

Genomic rearrangements result in transcriptional dysregulation of a gene, or in the generation of fusion gene transcripts or fusion proteins. The list of clinically significant recurrent gene fusions in solid tumours, including breast cancer, is growing, although no clear evidence for functional rearrangements involving the ESR1 gene have been reported. Recently, however, a study that analysed the more-aggressive and endocrine-resistant luminal B tumour subtype has identified and characterized a recurrent genomic rearrangement event involving the ESR1 gene and its chromosomal neighbour, CCDC170. The identified ESR1–CCDC170 gene fusion exemplifies a gain-of-function alteration, in which the expression of N-terminally truncated forms of CCDC170 is increased through fusion of corresponding regions of the CCDC170 gene with the ESR1 constitutive promoter. When introduced in breast cancer cells, the truncated CCDC170 protein led to increased motility, tumourigenicity, and endocrine-resistance phenotypes. Another report has recently described a YAP1–ESR1 translocation event in a metastatic ER+ breast cancer, whereby the N-terminal end of the ER is fused to the C-terminus of YAP1. The ER LBD is absent from this chimeric protein, thus the expression of this mutant leads to ligand-independent tumour growth and complete resistance to fulvestrant. Ongoing studies are expected to provide a more-complete spectrum of the various infrequent and more-recurrent ESR1 fusions, and their role in the pathology and endocrine resistance of primary and metastatic ER+ breast cancer.

## ESR1 missense mutations

Recurrent gain-of-function missense mutations have been reported in multiple oncogenes or key signalling molecules involved in cancer development and progression. No recurrent mutations in the ESR1 gene were identified in the TCGA study. Interestingly, Fuqua *et al.* have described a highly frequent gain-of-function ESR1 mutation in one third of hyperplastic breast lesions and half of ER+ primary breast cancers analysed. This somatic mutation, K303R, resides within the ER hinge domain and was recently comprehensively reviewed elsewhere. Specifically, the overexpression of K303R-mutated ER in ER+ breast cancer cell lines resulted in oestrogen hypersensitivity, as well as a decrease in endocrine-treatment sensitivity when engaged in crosstalk with growth factor signalling pathways. Furthermore, the same group reported an association between the presence of the ER K303R mutation and poor outcome in patients with breast cancer who had not received treatment. The presence and frequency of this mutation remains an open question, owing to the fact that only two additional studies have reported such mutations, albeit at a lower frequency (5–10%). By contrast, several other studies, including the large TCGA dataset, could not identify this mutation in primary or metastatic tumours. Future studies should address these controversies, which might be related to the sequencing methods used in the different studies to date. As mentioned, herein we focus on the recently discovered recurrent ER LBD mutations.

The numbers of sequenced metastatic and primary breast cancer samples and reported ESR1 (ERα) LBD point mutations (*) are indicated for each study. The dashed lines indicate primary tumours that were sequenced subsequently to the detection of the ESR1 LBD mutation in their matched metastatic specimens. The ER+ BC cohort from the study by Jeselsohn et al.⁴² included upfront 37 matched ER+ metastatic and primary sample pairs; in two of these pairs (*), ESR1 LBD mutations were detected in the metastatic, but not in the primary tumours.

and response to treatment in the BOLERO-2 study could not be confirmed; nonetheless, the presence of the mutations did not seem to affect response to exemestane, presumably because all the patients in the study had already experienced disease progression on a previous treatment with an aromatase inhibitor.³⁹ In two other small studies by Robinson et al.⁴⁰ and Merenbakh-Lamin et al.,⁴¹ 11 and 13 metastatic ER+ tumour samples were sequenced, respectively. The investigators were able to detect ESR1 mutations affecting the ER LBD in 6 out of 11 (54%)⁴⁰ and 5 out of 13 (38%)⁴¹ patients. Finally, in a larger study,⁴² 76 metastatic ER+ breast tumour samples were sequenced at a level of high coverage using next-generation targeted sequencing, and ER LBD mutations were detected in 11 patients (14.5%). Conversely, in the ER-negative metastatic tumour samples, no ESR1 mutations affecting the ER LBD have been reported.⁴⁰ Furthermore, none of these ESR1 mutations were detected among the 58 primary ER+ tumours sequenced. These primary tumours included two samples that had matched metastatic samples harbouring the ESR1 mutations.⁴²

Overall, a total of 187 metastatic ER+ breast tumours samples from patients who received at least one line of endocrine treatment have been sequenced in the five studies, and ER LBD mutations were identified in 39 patients (21%).³⁸⁻⁴² The prevalence of the mutations in the different studies ranges between 14–54%. This wide range of prevalence rates might be explained by considering the small patient cohorts in some of the studies, and also the differences in the patient populations and their treatment course. Of note, the larger cohort study of Jeselsohn et al.⁴² showed a correlation between the prevalence of the hotspot LBD mutations and the number of lines of endocrine treatment.⁴²

The mutations were detected in tumour samples obtained from different organ sites, including lymph nodes, skin, lung, and liver,³⁸⁻⁴² suggesting that these mutations do not display specific organotropism. The majority of the LBD mutations in these studies were missense mutations of residues Y537 and D538 (Figure 2). The most common mutations included Y537S (* = 11), Y537N (* = 6), and Y537C (* = 4), and D538G (* = 13) missense mutations. Of note, an early single report documented the Y537N mutation in one metastatic breast cancer case.⁷⁴ Additional mutations found in this hotspot region were L536Q, L536R, P535H, and V534E. In addition, three double mutants were detected within the same tumour (Y537N/D538G, S436P/D538G, S436P/Y537N), although it is not clear whether these mutations reside within the same ER molecule, whether they co-occur within the same cell, or whether they represent different cell subpopulations within a heterogeneous tumour. Another LBD mutation, E380Q, has been identified in three tumour samples and is localized outside of the hotspot region,³⁸,³⁹,⁴² whereas no additional recurrent alterations in other domains of the ER protein were observed.

### ER-LBD-activating ESR1 mutations

#### In metastatic disease

In the past 2 years, five studies have reported the identification of missense point mutations in the portion of the ESR1 gene that encodes the ER LBD domain in metastatic ER+ breast cancers (Figure 1).³⁸⁻⁴² The first study³⁸ detected ESR1 mutations in three of seven (43%) patient-derived xenografts that were established from metastatic tumour samples from patients with ER+ disease. These mutations were detected by whole-genome sequencing and were confirmed with an analysis of the originating tumours.³⁶ In a second study, ER+ metastatic tumour samples from two patient cohorts were sequenced by targeted next-generation sequencing; these cohorts included 36 patients who had disease progression after at least 3 months of hormonal therapy, and 44 patients enrolled in the BOLERO-2 clinical trial.³⁹ The BOLERO-2 trial enrolled patients who had developed disease refractory to an aromatase inhibitor—defined as disease recurrence within 12 months of completion of adjuvant endocrine treatment or with progressive disease during treatment with an aromatase inhibitor for metastatic disease.⁷³ In these cohorts, 14 (17.5%) patients were found to harbour ER LBD mutations. The analysis also included the sequencing of the primary tumours from 183 of the patients enrolled in the BOLERO-2 trial. Of note, ESR1 mutations were detected in 3% of the primary tumours.⁷³ Because of the small number of patients with ESR1 mutations, a definitive association between the presence of ESR1 mutations

#### In treatment-naive early stage disease

To better understand genetic mechanisms of metastatic ER+ disease, Toy et al.³⁹ have compared the prevalence of

the ER mutants induced and enhanced ligand-dependent expression of exogenous (transfected) and endogenous genes, such as PR, GREB1, and TTF1, driven by the classic oestrogen responsive element (ERE).^{38–42} Fulvestrant and tamoxifen were both able to inhibit the mutated ER, albeit at doses substantially higher than those needed to inhibit the wild-type ER, suggesting partial but not complete resistance to these hormonal agents.^{39–42} Microarray gene-expression analysis, under hormone-depleted conditions, of ER+ breast cancer cells overexpressing the ER mutants, or wild-type ER as controls, showed increased expression of known oestrogen-responsive genes in the mutant cells and also identified an additional set of genes uniquely expressed by the mutant cells that are not known as classic ER target genes.^{39} Hence, the transcriptional programme mediated by mutant ER is ligand-independent and possibly not limited to the known oestrogen-induced genes, but rather includes a new set of direct or indirect target genes (Figure 3).

The ligand-independent activity of the ER mutants also conferred a cell-proliferation advantage to cells grown in oestrogen-deprived conditions or in the presence of fulvestrant and tamoxifen.^{38,41,42} Increased ligand-independent tumour growth was also observed *in vivo* using xenograft models of ER+ breast cancer derived from cells overexpressing the mutant ER.^{39} Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) established using cells from a human metastatic breast tumour harbouring the ER LBD Y537 mutation also exhibited ligand-independent growth.^{38} However, the growth pattern of the PDXs harbouring the recurrent LBD ER E380Q mutation was ligand-dependent.^{38} Thus, E380Q mutant ER might promote tumour growth through a different mechanism than the constitutive ER activity observed with the Y537 and D538 mutant forms of this protein. Finally, breast cancer cells overexpressing D538 ER-LBD mutations exhibited an increased migration capacity.^{41} This finding suggests an increased invasion property for cancerous cells harbouring the mutation, which could contribute to increased metastatic progression and might explain why these mutations were detected mainly in metastatic lesions. In line with this hypothesis, it should be noted that some of the genes (such as MMP11,^{77} WNT11,^{78} and RET^{79,80}) uniquely expressed in the cells overexpressing the ER-LBD mutants have been indicated to have roles in related migratory processes. Additional studies are needed to confirm the potential role of these molecular effectors and to fully characterize the ‘invasiveness’ properties of the ER mutants.

### Mechanistic insights into resistance

In the absence of ligand, wild-type ER is protected from proteosomal degradation by interaction with the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) chaperone complex.^7 Binding of oestrogen to the ER induces a conformational change, known as the agonistic active conformation,^{81,82} which leads to the dissociation of ER from the chaperone complex, its dimerization, and the association with co-regulatory proteins driven by the agonistic conformation of the C-terminal helix 12 of ER. Previous structural studies of the wild-type and Y537S ER proteins have revealed

### Resistance and cellular phenotypes

Consistent with earlier studies,^{74–76} all the recent papers^{38–42} showed that the mutations within the hotspot region of the ER LBD, particularly the point mutations affecting residues Y537 and D538, are gain-of-function mutations that result in both ligand-independent and enhanced ligand-stimulated ER activity (Figure 3). Indeed, overexpression of

REVIEW

Figure 3 | Genomic classic and nonclassic transcriptional activities of ER. **a** | Classic ER transcription activity is mediated by ER binding to DNA at consensus ERE sites, whereas in the nonclassic ER-activity mode, the receptor is tethered to other TFs, such as AP-1 or NFκB, and regulates gene expression from the cognate DNA sequences of these binding partners. The transcriptional activity of ER and other TFs is further modulated by RTKs and other signalling pathway-induced kinases (such as MAPK and AKT) that phosphorylate ER, its CoA, and other components of the transcriptional machinery to control the overall transcriptional programme needed for tumour development and progression. Breast cancer cells with wild-type ER are largely sensitive to standard endocrine therapies (Als, Tam, and Ful). **b** | Differential expression profiles between wild-type and mutant ERs suggest an augmented nonclassic genomic activity of ER-LBD mutants, which might enhance RTK signalling and the metastatic capacity of the tumour cells. Furthermore, ER-LBD mutant cells display an endocrine resistant phenotype, and current findings suggest the need of alternative therapeutic strategies, such as higher doses of Ful or Tam, more potent or mutant-specific SERMs or SERDs (BZD and ARN-810, respectively), agents targeting ER co-activators and ER gene products (such as cyclinD1 blockade by CDK4/6 inhibitors), or other signalling pathways and kinase inhibitors (such as mTOR, PI3K, and HSP90 inhibitors) alone or in combination with ER inhibitors.

In terms of treatments, the ER-LBD mutants display relative resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant. Studies to directly evaluate the affinity of all these ER-LBD mutants for tamoxifen and fulvestrant have not been conducted. However, it is highly plausible that the changes in the dynamics between the agonist and antagonist conformation of the ER-LBD mutants in the absence of ligand represent the mechanism underlying this resistance. In support of this hypothesis are the findings of increased co-regulator binding to mutant ER after tamoxifen treatment, when compared to wild-type ER. Furthermore, the fact that mutant ER are resistant to fulvestrant-induced degradation offers mechanistic proof of their relative resistance to this drug.

### Tumour evolution and clinical relevance

Breast cancers, similar to many other types of cancers, present an extensive degree of intratumour heterogeneity, with genetic, epigenetic, and histopathological phenotypic diversities among the tumour epithelial cells. The interplay between genetic instability and the resultant continuous accumulation of somatic mutations in tumour cells on one hand, and, on the other hand, the need for these cells to resist and adapt to constraints from the tumour microenvironment or other exogenous factors provide the basis for a dynamic clonal evolution in cancers, which largely operates according to the Darwinian evolutionary model. Several clinical and preclinical studies, which

Figure 4 | Clonal selection of rare ESR1 mutations. Two possible scenarios for the origin of the ESR1 (ER) LBD mutations detected in endocrine-resistant metastatic breast cancer are possible: pre-existing rare ESR1 LBD mutant subclones (red ×) in treatment-naive primary tumours or *de novo* ESR1 mutations acquired during therapy. In both cases a selection and an expansion of the ESR1-mutant clones occurs over multiple lines of endocrine therapy (violet triangle) leading to an acquired endocrine-resistant phenotype. Abbreviations: AIs, aromatase inhibitors; ER, oestrogen receptor α; LBD, ligand-binding domain; Tam, tamoxifen.

strongly support this phenomenon, provide compelling evidence to suggest that acquired resistance in many cases also reflects the outgrowth and expansion of rare pre-existing drug-resistant clones in response to the selective pressure of targeted therapies.⁹⁶,⁹⁷ The ligand-independent endocrine resistant property of the ER-LBD mutants, and the fact that these mutants are detected almost exclusively in the context of metastatic breast cancer with acquired endocrine resistance, but not treatment-naive primary tumours, seems to indicate that a selection of these rare resistant (ER-LBD mutant) clones occurs only under the pressure of endocrine treatment (Figure 4). Toy *et al.*³⁹ reported that the allele frequencies of these ER-LBD mutations ranged between 6–84% in metastatic tumour samples, indicating continued tumour heterogeneity, which might remain essential even after clonal selection.

The rare ER-LBD-mutant cells might arise from a rare and undetectable pre-existing clone in the treatment-naive primary tumours, or might have been acquired *de novo* during the course of treatment (Figure 4). In any case, the rare mutant clones, possessing a selective advantage over other endocrine-sensitive clones, expand to become a more-predominant clone over the course of successive lines of endocrine therapy. The distinction between these two scenarios has several clinical implications. First, the timing of the appearance of these mutations will dictate when patients should be screened; screening at an early stage of the disease will likely require more-sensitive techniques. Second, if the mutations can be detected in primary tumours, it will be important to understand their prognostic and predictive significance and their effect on the interval to disease recurrence (early versus late recurrences) through retrospective and prospective studies. Finally, if the ESR1 mutations are acquired during treatment, it would be important to monitor for their appearance. Nonetheless, in both scenarios, detecting the mutations as early as possible is required for prognosis and clinical decision-making.

It is important to reiterate that most patients in the five studies³⁸⁻⁴² that observed missense ESR1 mutations affecting the ER LBD received treatment with an aromatase inhibitor before the detection of the mutation, which

raises the question whether the ER-LBD mutations possess a superior advantage under oestrogen-deprivation treatments (with aromatase inhibitors) compared with other endocrine treatment modalities. In this context, whether the observation that the frequency of ER-LBD mutations correlates with increasing numbers of endocrine treatment lines is related merely to the longer duration of selective pressure enabling expansion of the mutated clones, or should be attributed to the necessity for an acquired second hit, remains an unanswered question. An additional open question is whether and how more-effective endocrine therapies or longer durations of adjuvant endocrine therapy, by increasing the selection pressure and its time-span, will affect the time of emergence and frequency of ER-LBD mutations.

### Emerging detection platforms

Massively parallel next-generation sequencing techniques enable the quantification of the proportion of cells harbouring a given mutation in cancer, but their inherent error rate of up to 1% limits the sensitivity to detect infrequent mutations.88 Even technologies using targeted sequencing that allow ‘deeper’ sequencing remain limited by this error rate.89 Improved technologies that can detect the presence of mutations in a very small fraction of cells (<1%), which might be the case for *ESR1* mutations in primary disease or at the time of their first emergence in advanced-stage disease, are essential to discern the full complexity and heterogeneity of breast cancers and to identify potentially actionable rare mutations. Low cellularity, which is commonly found in many tumour specimens, further challenges the detection of these rare mutations.90 A few emerging promising new technologies that dramatically decrease the sequencing error rate have the potential to become useful tools to overcome these limitations. These technologies include the Safe-Sequencing System (Safe-SeqS),91 which tags each template molecule to allow for confident identification of rare variants, and the ultrasensitive Duplex sequencing,92 which independently tags and sequences each of the two strands of a DNA duplex. With these improved technologies, the potential background error rate is less than one error per 10⁹ nucleotides sequenced, thus enabling detection of ultra-rare mutations within heterogeneous cellular populations.92 Digital droplet PCR,93,94 which emulsifies DNA in thousands to millions of droplets to encapsulate single DNA molecules, designed with mutant-specific primers, is another emerging platform for detection and quantification of rare mutations. The current implementation of these technologies in clinical research and eventually their transition to the clinical setting will improve our capacity to detect rare *ESR1* mutations and other genetic alterations over the course of disease progression, and will facilitate the development of clinical studies to reveal the potential clinical utility of identifying these mutations.

As mentioned previously, the pattern of the tumour evolution of the *ESR1* mutations that was unveiled in the recent publications emphasizes the importance of studying these and other genetic alterations over the natural course of breast cancer. Testing for these mutations should take place at the time of initial diagnosis, at the time of each recurrence and disease progression, and even when there is no evidence of disease or the disease is stable, ideally by obtaining a tissue specimen. However, obtaining tissue biopsies from metastatic disease is difficult, and is more challenging in cases of multiple synchronous metastatic lesions. Therefore, alternative approaches enabling the detection of mutations in liquid biopsies, including the analysis of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) or cell-free DNA from blood samples,95 along with additional ultra-sensitive methods,96 are in development. Implementation of the more-sensitive assays to detect rare mutations along with systematic collection of patient samples at all disease stages will enable the identification of patients for stratification in the future prospective clinical trials that are necessary for studying the clinical significance of *ESR1* mutations in disease progression, resistance to standard endocrine treatments, and response to emerging therapeutic strategies.

### Novel therapeutic strategies

The preclinical studies on the effect of the ER-LBD mutations report a relative resistance of the activating mutations to tamoxifen and fulvestrant, but effective inhibition of these mutants with higher doses of these agents (Figure 3).38–42 These findings, together with the results of the structural studies, suggest that higher doses of fulvestrant or tamoxifen or more-potent (or mutant-specific) SERMs or SERDs might benefit patients with tumours harbouring LBD-mutated ER. Given the results of the CONFIRM study,97 which showed increased survival with higher dose fulvestrant, it will be important to test whether high-dose fulvestrant can inhibit these mutations. The CONFIRM study was a phase III study that randomly assigned postmenopausal patients with advanced-stage ER+ breast cancer to receive either 500 mg or 250 mg of monthly fulvestrant.97 The higher dose was associated with increased progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival without additional significant toxicity.97 Another consideration will be to test the efficacy of high-dose tamoxifen, specifically in patients with metastatic disease and ER-LBD mutations—particularly as an acceptable toxicity profile for a high dose of this drug has been reported in several small studies.98,99 New-generation SERMs and SERDs, such as bazedoxifene100 and ARN-810,101 are being extensively studied in the preclinical setting for their efficacy in the inhibition of the ER-LBD mutants and are expected to guide the clinical development of these agents. Indeed, an open phase I/IIa clinical trial of ARN-810 in postmenopausal patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER+ breast cancer plans to include an expansion arm of 30 patients confirmed to have ER-LBD mutations.102 The activity of mutated ER remains highly dependent on the recruitment of co-activators, therefore, new agents targeting ER co-activators, such as the recently described small-molecule SRC-3 inhibitors,103,104 might offer another approach to target the ER mutants and should be tested alone and in combination with other ER antagonists (Figure 3). The constitutive ligand-independent activity of the ER mutants suggests

inhibitors, were tested. The results were highly complex and varied among the two available models, but the study identified the efficacy of mTOR, PI3K, and HSP90 inhibitors in this setting, especially when used in combination with fulvestrant.¹¹⁰

# Conclusions

The recent discovery of recurrent *ESR1* mutations within the region of the gene that encodes the ER LBD in endocrine-resistant metastatic ER+ breast cancers sheds new light on the mechanisms of clinical endocrine resistance. The mutations were found in about 15–20% of patients, the majority of whom had received therapy with an aromatase inhibitor, with increasing frequencies detected in patients who received multiple endocrine treatments.³⁸⁻⁴² Functional and mechanistic studies demonstrated that the mutations confer a ligand-independent agonistic conformation to the ER LBD resulting in ligand-independent and enhanced ER transcriptional activity, tumour growth, and enhanced migratory properties.⁴¹ The ER-LBD-mutated cancers displayed relative resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant, which could be reversed with high doses of these agents.³⁸⁻⁴² These mutations are seldom detected in treatment-naive primary tumours, suggesting either the clonal selection of very rare resistant clones or their later acquisition under the pressure of endocrine treatments as a new and major mechanism of resistance.

Collectively, these exciting findings introduce new clinical challenges and opportunities (Figure 5). Innovative platforms that enable the detection of rare subclonal mutations are a key component to accurately elucidating the prevalence and the clinical predictive and prognostic consequences of ER-LBD mutations in early and advanced stages of ER+ breast cancer. In addition to the analysis of retrospectively collected tissues from large clinical trials, the systematic collections of tumour tissues or liquid biopsies throughout the course of disease, including at initial diagnosis and at disease recurrence and progression, and their analysis with these emerging technologies, will eventually enable the stratification of patients in clinical trials based on the presence of *ESR1* mutations. In addition, detection of such mutations in liquid biopsies might offer an approach to early detection of resistant occult micrometastatic residual disease during or after adjuvant endocrine treatment, although the clinical significance of such a finding remains to be established. These types of studies will eventually disclose the overall contribution of *ESR1* genetic aberrations including amplifications and rearrangements to endocrine resistance and, more importantly, their weight in terms of clinical decision-making.

On the basis of the available studies, new therapeutic strategies should first be studied in preclinical models that accurately recapitulate the genomic complexity of patient tumours. If successfully translated to the clinical setting, our abilities to better detect the mutations, predict resistance, and effectively treat tumours harbouring these mutations will have a substantial impact on patient outcome. Implementation of these strategies in early stage disease holds the promise to improve cure rates.
