ABSTRACT

Viral G-protein-coupled receptors (vGPCRs) are chemokine receptor homologues encoded by the Herpes- and Capripoxviridae. They are thought to have been hijacked from the host genome during the course of evolution. These vGPCRs play different roles in the viral lifecycle and associated pathologies. Three members of the Herpesviridae, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) are capable of setting up persistent latent infections in humans. Two of the herpesviruses, KSHV and EBV, are associated with cancer, while HCMV may have an oncomodulatory effect.

The vGPCRs may contribute to the escape of immune surveillance and (constitutively) activate signaling pathways linked to proliferation and inflammation. Some vGPCRs induce activation of autocrine and paracrine signaling, resulting in secretion of growth factors and/or cytokines. As a result, vGPCRs effectively rewire cellular signaling networks. Delineating the cellular signaling networks modulated by these vGPCRs will be crucial for treatment of virus-associated pathologies.

1. Introduction

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a diverse family of membrane receptors which can be activated by ligands varying from light (as in rhodopsin) to proteins (e.g., the chemokine receptors). Despite being activated by such a variety of ligands, the receptors themselves are similar in structure composition. All GPCRs are composed of seven transmembrane domains, and couple to hetero-trimeric G-proteins resulting in a plethora of possible cellular responses to receptor activation (Rosenbaum et al., 2009).

The mammalian chemokine (the name is derived from chemotactic cytokines) signaling system is composed of small protein ligands (the chemokines with a size around 8–10 kDa) that bind and activate chemokine receptors. Together, chemokines and chemokine receptors are important mediators of the mammalian immune system. Chemokine nomenclature is based on conserved cysteine motifs and the chemokine family can be subdivided into four families, CCL, CXCL, XCL and CX3CL. In this system, the chemokines themselves are noted with an L at the end and the receptors with an R at the end. There is a large amount of promiscuity in the chemokine/chemokine receptor system as some chemokines activate multiple chemokine receptors (Fig. 1). The superfamily of chemokines is currently composed of at least 46 members the majority of which belongs to either the CCL or the CXCL family. The XCL and CX3CL families only have two and one member, respectively (Zlotnik et al., 2006).

The main function of chemokines, as the name suggests, is to attract cells and the different chemokines work on different kinds of cells. The CCL chemokines attract a variety of cells from the immune system, whereas the CXC chemokines mainly attract neutrophils

and lymphocytes. Furthermore, the CXCR chemokines possess angiogenic activity. The combination of these angiogenic properties and their homing response renders the CXCR chemokines to be of special interest in tumor growth as well as in metastasis. Notably, in breast cancer, the combined effects of, e.g., CXCR4 and CXCL12 are of importance for tumor development (Burger and Kipps, 2006).

The chemokine receptors are not only expressed in leukocytes, but are also present on cells that are of a non-hematopoietic origin such as endothelial cells and neurons (Fischer et al., 2008). Furthermore, several of the CXCR receptors have been reported to be associated with several tumors (Vandercappellen et al., 2008). This is not unexpected considering the observed angiogenic properties of some of the CXCR chemokines described above.

Mammalian viruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade or subvert the host’s immune system. Members of the Herpesviridae family are particularly successful in this respect, with some of them capable of achieving life-long infections in up to 90% of the general population. To be able to do this, several host genes have been ‘hijacked’ in the course of evolution by these viruses. This ‘hijacked’ genetic material includes genes encoding chemokines and chemokine receptors. The receptors and chemokines thus obtained have been severely modified and optimized for the virus’s own benefit and often exhibit unique characteristics, such as receptors that show promiscuous binding of ligands and constitutive activity. In several cases, which will be elaborated upon further in this review, these viral GPCRs (vGPCRs) have been shown to possess oncogenic properties. Besides the Herpesviridae, the Capripoxviridae family of viruses, also possesses vGPCRs (Le Goff et al., 2009). However, not much is known about these proteins, their functionality, and the role they may play in the viral life cycle, so they will not be discussed in this review. Although HHV6 and 7 also express vGPCRs the focus of this review will be on Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HHV8), Epstein-Barr virus (HHV4), and HCMV (HHV5). The current state of the vGPCRs encoded by these three herpesviruses and their potential involvement in cancer or other associated pathologies will be discussed.

2. Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)

KSHV or HHV8 is a γ-herpesvirus that was first identified in AIDS patients in the 1980s, when frequent occurrences of the usually rare Kaposi sarcoma (KS) were reported (Chang et al., 1994). The virus is endemic in Africa, with infection rates of over 50% in Central Africa, whilst infection rates in the rest of the world are much lower (between 0.2% and 10%). There are currently three different recognized variants of KS. Classic KS occurs mainly in Mediterranean men over the age of 50, and the lesions do not typically spread beyond the extremities. Endemic KS is common in particular parts of Africa. In Uganda, for example, KS accounts for up to 9% of the cancers. Finally, there is AIDS-associated KS, which was found initially predominantly in AIDS-affected patients, a particularly aggressive and often fatal variant of KS. In all the variants, KS is characterized by highly vascularized lesions (Antman and Chang, 2000). Moreover, KHSV is found in nearly 100% of tumor isolates from patients. KSHV is also associated with primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman’s disease (Cesarman et al., 1995; Dupin et al., 1999).

The KHSV genome consists of a double-stranded DNA genome, encoding 84 open-reading frames (Martin and Gutkind, 2009) and 12 microRNAs (miRNAs) (Cai et al., 2005). Open-reading frame 74 encodes a vGPCR, also referred to as ORF74. ORF74 is a close homologue of CXCR2 and binds many chemokines, particularly those of the CXCR family, which is indicative for a role in the avoidance of the host immune system by KSHV. In addition, ORF74 displays constitutive activity, which has been correlated with oncogenesis in vitro and in vivo (Arvanitakis et al., 1997; Bais et al., 1998). Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing ORF74 develop KS-like lesions (Yang et al., 2000; Guo et al., 2003). Host cell signal transduction pathways that are activated by ORF74 include mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt (Smit et al., 2002). ORF74 has also been shown to activate NF-κB via PI3K and Akt. Moreover, the activation of NF-κB by ORF74 is accompanied by the release of inflammatory cytokines (Pati et al., 2001). The chemokines CXCL8 and CXCL1 act as (partial) agonists upon ORF74 (Gershengorn et al., 1998). In contrast, CXCL10 and CXCL12 act as inverse agonists (Geras-Raaka et al., 1998b; Geras-Raaka et al., 1998a). Furthermore, ORF74 induces IL-6 release in infected cells, in the aforementioned manner via NF-κB. Subsequently, IL-6 triggers VEGF production in both a paracrine as well as autocrine manner (Pati et al., 2001). Moreover, KSHV encodes a viral IL-6 homologue (vIL-6) that may further strengthen the inflammatory responses in the infected cells (Neipel et al., 1997). The increased IL-6 levels induced by ORF74 produce an inflammatory environment that has been shown to promote transformation of cells and formation of tumors (Yu et al., 2002). IL-6 secretion and subsequent paracrine or autocrine activation of the JAK/STAT axis are thought to play an important role in these processes (Yu et al., 2009; Rebouissou et al., 2009). Interestingly, stimulation of cells neighboring the IL-6 producing cells may also induce an epigenetic switch, a process where a transient event results in a permanent change in phenotype of the affected cells, which has recently been described by Iliopoulos et al. (2009) in a breast cancer model.

Only a small amount of the tumor cells in KS is actually KSHV positive in early KS. In later stage disease, more than 90% of the tumor cells are KSHV positive (Dupin et al., 1999). In the latter case, only a small subset actually displays a gene expression profile typical for the lytic phase, including ORF74 expression (Chiou et al., 2002). Although ORF74 is not the only oncogenic determinant in KSHV, this observation is striking. A small number of ORF74 expressing cells can alter the behavior of the surrounding tumor cells via paracrine signaling by inducing the production of factors like IL-6. Such a feed-forward mechanism creates a inflammatory

environment which may be an important factor in KSHV related cancers. How this may work at the molecular level remains to be elucidated.

3. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)

EBV or HHV4 is another lymphotropic virus involved in proliferative diseases. This γ-herpesvirus was first identified in the 1960s. It infects over 90% of humans and persists during lifetime. Infection with EBV usually occurs by contact with oral secretions, causing infectious mononucleosis, also known as kissing disease. The virus replicates in cells in the oropharynx. B cells in the oropharynx are the primary site of infection and resting memory B cells are thought to be the site of persistence of EBV within the body. Shedding of EBV from the oropharynx is abolished in patients treated with acyclovir, whereas the number of EBV-infected B cells in the circulation remains the same as before treatment (Cohen, 2000).

EBV-related diseases are B cell- and epithelial cell-specific diseases, namely Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Hsu and Glaser, 2000). All of these diseases are particularly common in immune-suppressed patients like HIV-infected patients and recipients of organ or bone marrow transplants. Immune-compromised patients have impaired T-cell immunity and are unable to control the proliferation of EBV-infected B cells. EBV may play a pathogenic role in several other lymphoproliferative diseases and tumors in which EBV DNA or proteins have been detected as well.

The EBV genome consists of a linear DNA molecule that encodes approximately 94 ORFs or viral proteins. During viral replication, these proteins are important for regulation of the expression of viral genes, replicating viral DNA, forming structural components of the virion, and modulating the host immune response. Of the almost 100 viral genes that are expressed during replication, a small subset is expressed in latently infected B cells *in vitro*. Two types of non-translated RNA, six nuclear proteins, and two membrane proteins are expressed in these latently infected B cells (Middeldorp et al., 2003).

Like KSHV, the EBV genome also contains a single viral GPCR, BILF1, a gene specifically expressed in the lytic phase of the viral replication cycle. BILF1 presents (low) homology to chemokine receptor CXCR4, a chemokine receptor known to be involved in many cancers (Burger and Kipps, 2006). In contrast with ORF74 from KSHV, BILF1 does not seem to display oncogenic properties *in vitro* (Smit et al., unpublished observations). Attempts that were undertaken so far to deorphanize BILF1 have not been successful. However, downstream signaling by BILF1 can be studied as this receptor, like other vGPCRs, signals in a constitutive manner through Gαi (Paulsen et al., 2005, Beisser et al., 2005). It has been suggested that EBV may use BILF1 to control Gαi-activated pathways during viral lytic replication, thereby affecting disease progression (Paulsen et al., 2005).

The function of BILF1 has also been examined in the context of immune evasion. Expression of BILF1 constitutively inhibits the phosphorylation of RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) (Beisser et al., 2005). Upon viral infection, PKR is phosphorylated and activated, causing the overall cellular translational machinery to stop, thereby prohibiting viral replication (Garcia et al., 2006). This mechanism serves to prevent viral spreading by elimination of the infected cells. Thus, the inhibition of PKR by BILF1 may help EBV by preventing a cellular antiviral response. Moreover, Zuo et al. (2009) showed recently that BILF1 reduces the levels of MHC class I at the cell surface of epithelial and melanoma cells. Targeting these molecules for lysosomal degradation, results in impaired recognition by immune T cells. Together with two other EBV lytic cycle genes BGLF5 and BNLF2A, BILF1 is the third gene in a group that

cooperates to interfere with MHC class I antigen processing. This underscores the importance of the need for EBV to be able to evade CD8+ T cell responses during the lytic replication cycle. The effect on MHC class I degradation is independent of constitutive BILF1 signaling functions and the molecular mechanisms are distinct. It involves physical association of BILF1 with MHC class I molecules, an increased turnover from the cell surface, and enhanced degradation via lysosomal proteases (Zuo et al., 2009).

In addition to the above-mentioned immune-escape mechanisms, viral GPCRs may also affect the properties of human receptors by means of receptor oligomerization and/or downstream signaling cross-talk. GPCR proteins can physically interact with each other, thereby modifying intracellular signaling and cellular functions (Milligan, 2006). B lymphocyte migration and functioning is regulated by chemokines acting on their cognate receptors. We have recently shown using BRET, trFRET and co-immunoprecipitation techniques that BILF1 heterodimerizes with various chemokine receptors endogenously expressed in B lymphocytes. The oligomerization of BILF1 with chemokine receptors that are involved in B lymphocyte migration may change the receptors responsiveness to chemokines, resulting in altered homing and homeostasis of infected B lymphocytes. This might be an essential step for EBV dissemination or in EBV-induced pathogenesis in general (Vischer et al., 2008). Negative binding cooperativity of both cognate chemokines and small drug-like compounds has been shown for CCR2/CCR5 and CCR2/CXCR4 chemokine receptor heterodimers (Springael et al., 2007). Since BILF1 is still an orphan GPCR, such binding cooperativity cannot be investigated at this moment. On the other hand, the active conformation of the constitutive active BILF1 might affect the function of partnering receptors in a hetero-oligomer, as previously shown for other GPCR dimers (Han et al., 2009). As BILF1 seems to play a role in preventing the immune system from clearing the virus from the body, this may present an extra venue that can be targeted in treatment of EBV infection.

4. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)

Another member of the Herpesviridae family and β-herpesvirus subfamily is HCMV (HHV-5). HCMV is widely present among the general population, with up to 90% of the individuals harboring a latent infection (Gandhi and Khanna, 2004). While HCMV infection is asymptomatic in immune-competent individuals, it can cause severe pathologies in immune-compromised patients (Soderberg-Naucler, 2006). HCMV infection during pregnancy can result in aberrant development of the unborn child resulting in, for example, hearing loss (Alford et al., 1990, Verbeeck et al., 2008). Furthermore, HCMV infection has been correlated to several pathologies, such as atherosclerosis (Melnick et al., 1994).

HCMV proteins, DNA, and mRNA have been detected in multiple tumors which, together with epidemiological data, suggest a role for HCMV in cancer (Cobbs et al., 2002, Harkins et al., 2002). Furthermore, HCMV preferably infects cancer cells (Cinatl et al., 2004). However, unlike KSHV and EBV, HCMV is not considered an oncogenic virus and it is unlikely that HCMV by itself can act as an oncogenic factor. Alternatively, HCMV may have an oncomodulatory role, to catalyze an oncogenic process that has already been initiated.

The HCMV genome is the largest of any human virus known so far, being 236 kb in size. The genome can be divided into two parts, a long part and a short part named UL and US, respectively. Also, a number of miRNAs have been found to be present on the HCMV genome (Grey and Nelson, 2008). In contrast with KSHV, the HCMV genome encodes four vGPCRs; US27, US28, UL33, and UL78. All of these genes encode chemokine receptor homologues,

indicating that they were most likely pirated from the human- or another mammalian-genome at some point during evolution (Chee et al., 1990, Gompels and Macaulay, 1995). Homologues of UL33 and UL78 are conserved throughout the β-herpesvirus family, whereas homologues of US28 and US27 have been identified only in primate CMVs closely related to HCMV. Furthermore, two chemokines have been pirated from the human genome, vCXC1 and vCXC2 (Penfold et al., 1999).

Only US28 has been shown to bind to chemokines, and has been most intensively studied. US28 binds promiscuously to several different members of the CC family, including CCL5 and CCL2, and also binds CX3CL1. Upon binding of chemokines, US28 is rapidly internalized, reflecting a possible function as a chemokine sink in the viral life cycle (Randolph-Habecker et al., 2002). Like ORF74 and BILF1, US28 displays constitutive signaling, activating PLCβ and NF-κB (Casarosa et al., 2001) as well as NFAT and CREB (McLean et al., 2004) via Gαq, Gαi, and Gas. The constitutive signaling through CREB has been found to play a role in the regulation of the viral genome, specifically by stimulating the immediate-early gene promoter (Wen et al., 2009). Signaling via Gα12 results in SMC migration (Melnychuk et al., 2004). Interestingly, US28 has been shown to possess tumorigenic properties when expressed in a NIH-3T3 murine fibroblast cell line, upregulating VEGF production and Cyclin D1. In a mouse xenograft model, tumors were formed when US28 expressing NIH-3T3 cells were injected (Maussang et al., 2006). Further investigation revealed that release of PGE2 via US28-induced NF-κB activation of COX2 results in the activation of VEGF and Cyclin D1. This signaling cascade can be perturbed using pharmacological inhibitors of COX2 (e.g., Celecoxib) (Maussang et al., 2009). These data suggest a role of US28 in HCMV-related cancers that may be reminiscent of ORF74s role in KSHV, with the important distinction that HCMV, and thus US28, are probably not direct causative agents. However, as stated above, US28 most likely has an oncomodulatory role. This is strongly suggested by the observations that in many cell lines prolonged US28 expression results in apoptosis (Pleskoff et al., 2005), indicating an interference of US28 in critical signaling pathways which, depending on cellular context results in either proliferation or apoptosis. It remains to

be seen whether US28 also induces a local environmental change reminiscent of ORF74, but the US28-induced release of PGE2 suggests such a possibility. The fact that NF-κB is activated by US28 supports this notion, since NF-κB is known to induce the secretion of inflammatory factors.

Another vGPCR encoded by HCMV is UL33, which has been shown to signal in a constitutive manner via Gαq, Gαi, and Gas (Casarosa et al., 2003). UL33’s mouse homologue M33 has a function in viral dissemination within the host. Interestingly, a ΔM33 MCMV (viral strain lacking expression of M33) strain can be complemented with UL33, which suggest that UL33 may serve a role in the HCMV life cycle (Case et al., 2008). Supporting such a role for UL33 in HCMV is the presence of UL33 on the virion itself (Margulies et al., 1996). Although US28 has never been detected in the viral envelope, there are indications that this is also the case. For instance, the rhesus macaque CMV homologue RhUS28.5 has been found in the viral envelope (Penfold et al., 2003). Furthermore, the envelope proteins gB and gH have been found to co-localize with US28 (Fraile-Ramos et al., 2002). Presence of vGPCRs on the viral particle likely enhances binding to target cells, considering that US28 recognizes the membrane-bound chemokine CX3CL1 (Kledal et al., 1998). However, in experiments *in vitro* with viral strains lacking either US28 or UL33 (ΔUS28 and ΔUL33, respectively) no reduced infectivity was observed (Vieira et al., 1998). Of note, *in vitro* there is no real necessity for viral dissemination and UL33 would not be necessary. The biochemical properties of the remaining two vGPCRs, US27 and UL78, remain thus far largely uncharacterized. US27 has been shown to be localized on the plasma membrane as well as in endosomes (Fraile-Ramos et al., 2002). The mouse and rat homologues of UL78, M78 and R78 respectively, have been shown to contribute to efficient viral cell–cell spread (Oliveira and Shenk, 2001, Beisser et al., 1999).

It is clear that US28 and its constitutive activity may rewire cellular signaling and by this means play a potential role in HCMV-related pathologies. However, the exact signaling pathways involved still remain to be further resolved. This will be critical for further understanding how HCMV may induce its oncomodulatory effects. Since US28 and UL33 are expressed at different time dur-

ing the viral cycle (Bodaghi et al., 1998), their expression will most likely modulate distinct signaling pathways at different times post infection.

# 5. Conclusions

The chemokine system, responsible for immune responses and as such an important mediator of the mammalian defense system against invasion of pathogens, has been corrupted by several β-herpesviruses. These viruses have hijacked and subverted many of the components of the chemokine system, both the ligands as well as the receptors. Although the three herpesviruses described above all have hijacked chemokine receptors, the role these vGPCRs play in the viral life cycle and the impact they have on host cell's signaling differs widely. Fig. 2 depicts the different ways virus-encoded chemokine receptors take over signaling in their respective target cells. KSHV's ORF74 induces NF-κB signaling via PI3K and its downstream kinase Akt, resulting in IL-6 release and the establishment of an inflammatory environment, beneficial for tumorigenesis. EBV's BILF1 appears to be mainly involved in immune avoidance, which is demonstrated by both the hijacking and subversion of both the PKR and the MHC1 signaling pathways. In addition, BILF1 may act as a chemokine receptor scavenger, possibly modulating chemokine receptor affinity for their ligands by means of negative binding cooperativity. This is in contrast with ORF74 and US28, that both negatively influence the immune system by binding the chemokines themselves. The HCMV encoded vGPCR US28 has been shown—at least in a specific cellular context—to be able to induce a proliferative phenotype. US28 may exert this effect by creating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment by activation of COX2 expression leading to PGE2 production. Furthermore, by modulating signaling through ROCK via Gα12, US28 is also able to promote smooth muscle cell migration. In cells without Gα12, US28 cannot induce migration further underlining the importance of cellular context.

In the cases described above, cellular signaling networks have been rewired to the benefit of the virus. In some cases radical alterations of cellular signaling can have unforeseen consequences and may result in or aggravate a transformed phenotype. These viral receptors provide invaluable insight into cellular pathways important in virus-associated pathologies and may prove in the future even to be promising drug targets for treatment or prevention of these virus-associated pathologies.
