### Introduction

The distinction between self and non-self antigens is maintained in a complex and carefully controlled immune process that requires balanced participation of several cell types, including dendritic cells and T and B lymphocytes. Under the influence of genetic and environmental factors, disruption of this balance leads to the development of incurable autoimmune diseases. Despite the persistence of intensive research studies, the precise triggers of autoimmune attack and the mechanisms that disrupt self-tolerance remain unclear.

For a number of years, B cells occupied a secondary stage in autoimmune diseases, and it was thought that their role was limited to production of pathogenic autoantibodies. However, there is a reviving interest in the role of B lymphocytes as contributors to the cause of autoimmunity. This revival stems from recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of tolerization and activation of B lymphocytes, the recently discovered role of B cells in regulating other cell lineages, the genetics of autoimmunity, and the emerging application of B cell-directed therapies. The critical role of B cells in autoimmunity is further illustrated by studies of their signaling pathways, both in patients and in experimental models, particularly because these signaling pathways offer potential avenues for designing novel therapies.

### B Cell Selection and Signaling

Throughout the development of B cells, lymphocyte survival and selection are determined by the specificity of the heterooligomeric B cell antigen receptor (BCR), a module that interacts with coreceptors, protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), adapters, and other proteins to propagate signaling cascades (1,2). Since the BCR is responsible for antigen recognition, the transduction events that occur after its ligation mediate interpretation of the magnitude and duration of BCR signaling (Figure 1). Characteristically, BCR-mediated signal transduction depends on optimal receptor aggregation and, therefore, on receptor density as well as antigen affinity and valence, and it has been suggested that at least 12 receptors must be cross-linked to induce signal transduction.

In addition to orchestrating the efficient development and subsequent activation of B lymphocytes at several discrete stages during B lineage differentiation, the BCR plays a central role in self-tolerance. During B lymphocyte development, potentially aggressive autoreactive B cells must be tolerized at various checkpoints. Studies over the past few years have provided a wealth of new information regarding the selection processes that, ultimately, result in biologic effects. Notably, transgenic expression or inactivation of genes encoding certain signaling molecules was found to lead to autoimmune phenomena and to disease, suggesting that a tight balance in BCR signaling pathways is required to prevent pathogenic autoimmune reactions (3–6).

#### Lyn

The first clue to the importance of immune receptor signaling in autoimmunity came from studies of the PTK Lyn. While Lyn is not critically required to initiate BCR signaling, it is an essential inhibitor of transduction pathways. B cells from mice homozygous for a disruption at the *LYN* locus have a delayed, but

B LYMPHOCYTES AND AUTOIMMUNITY

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Figure 1. Initial steps of B cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signaling. The BCR is composed of surface Ig with extracellular and transmembrane domains, and a short cytoplasmic tail. In addition, it contains 2 disulfide-bonded heterodimers of Igα and Igβ (CD79a and b, respectively) that physically associate with the Ig heavy chains and play a critical role in BCR/pre-BCR signaling (see refs. 1 and 2). Immediately after BCR engagement, Igα and Igβ are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues present on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) by activated Src-family protein tyrosine kinases (Lyn, Fyn, and Blk) that are under the control of the CD45 phosphatase. The ITAMs are characterized by the sequence motif D/E-x7-DEx2-Yx2L/I-x7-Y-x2I/L, and their phosphorylated tyrosines serve as potential docking sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins, including the protein tyrosine kinase families Src, Syk/ZAP70, and Tec. Phosphorylated ITAMs bind the Syk tyrosine kinase via its SH2 domain. Transphosphorylation and activation of Syk is followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous substrates, including adapter proteins (Grb2-associated binder, GAB1, and SHC) and additional signaling molecules with enzymatic activity. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) becomes activated and produces phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphates (PIP₃) that bind molecules having a pleckstrin homology domain, such as GAB1 and BTK (Bruton tyrosine kinase). Once bound to the membrane, GAB1 is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues, and in turn binds the SH2 domain of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-K, thereby amplifying PI3-K activity. Phosphorylated GAB1 also binds the SH2 domain-containing phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP) and the tyrosine SH2-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP-2), recruiting these molecules to the vicinity of their substrates on the cell membrane, and thus influencing their activity. Phosphorylation of the B cell-specific adapter protein BLNK, also called BASH, by BTK recruits phospholipase Cγ₂ (PLC), which after being activated, hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP₃). Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by DAG induces serine phosphorylation of a series of proteins. IP₃ mediates Ca²⁺ release from intracellular pools, which is followed by Ca²⁺ influx from the extracellular space. Phosphorylation of SHC, and assembling with the adaptor protein Grb2 and the exchange factor Sos, lead to the activation of the small GTP binding protein Ras, resulting in the activation of a serine/threonine kinase cascade and, eventually, the phosphorylation of several substrates, including transcription factors. P = phosphotyrosine; SOC = Store-operated calcium channel; ER = endoplasmic reticulum.

increased, Ca²⁺ flux and an exaggerated negative selection response to antigen, as well as a spontaneous hyperactivity (7,8). These Lyn-deficient mice also have circulating autoreactive antibodies and severe glomerulonephritis (GN) caused by the deposition of immune complexes (ICs) in the kidney, both of which are pathologic manifestations similar to those of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The role of Lyn in BCR-mediated signaling and in establishing B cell tolerance to self antigens is also supported by the phenotype of LYN deficiency on a C57BL/6 background. The mutant mice are more susceptible to myelin oligodendrocyte

glycoprotein-induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (9).

Further analysis of signaling pathways in $LYN^{-/-}$ mice demonstrated that regulation of BCR signaling is a complex quantitative trait in which the activating role of Lyn is mediated by the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of Igα, Igβ, and CD19, and by the subsequent recruitment of signaling enzymes such as Syk, phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2), and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (10). These positive effects are balanced by the negative regulatory role of Lyn in B cells through at least 2 pathways. First, Lyn is responsible for phosphorylating tyrosine residues of the negative BCR coreceptors Fcγ receptor IIb (FcγRIIb), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1), and programmed death 1 (PD-1) (described in more detail below). This activity may account, at least in part, for the enhanced BCR signaling seen in $LYN^{-/-}$ B cells and for the autoimmune phenotype observed in mice lacking these BCR coreceptors. Second, Lyn was shown to negatively regulate B cells by opposing the effect of Syk on BCR-mediated activation of Akt/protein kinase B (PKB). Deregulation of Akt/PKB correlates with the BCR-mediated hyperresponsiveness of $LYN^{-/-}$ B cells and might contribute to the autoimmune syndrome that develops in Lyn-deficient animals.

The key role of Lyn in establishing/maintaining peripheral tolerance also comes from studies of the consequences of sustained activation of Lyn in vivo using a targeted gain-of-function mutation (11). The mice, designated $LYN^{up/up}$, carry a single point mutation (Tyr508) in a sequence that negatively regulates Lyn activity. In addition, $LYN^{up/up}$ mice express a constitutively activated form of Lyn. The mutant mice thus allow study of the consequences of constitutive engagement of both stimulatory and inhibitory signaling pathways. These mice have reduced numbers of conventional B-2 lymphocytes, down-regulated surface IgM and costimulatory molecules, and elevated numbers of B-1a cells. In vitro, there is a heightened Ca²⁺ flux in response to BCR stimulation, and exaggerated positive signaling. Although there is a constitutive phosphorylation of the negative regulators of BCR signaling (SH2-containing phosphatase 1 [SHP-1] and SH2-containing phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatase [SHIP]), Syk and PLCγ2 are also constitutively phosphorylated. Surprisingly, $LYN^{up/up}$ mice develop circulating autoreactive antibodies and fatal autoimmune GN, suggesting that enhanced positive signaling can override constitutive negative signaling. The breakdown of self-tolerance seen in these $LYN^{up/up}$ mice may result from an imbalance between chronic negative signaling and enhanced positive signaling.

The results indicate that Lyn plays a central role in maintaining the equilibrium between positive and negative B cell signaling pathways, in regulating B cell tolerance, and in the development of autoimmunity. Moreover, the fact that both $LYN^{-/-}$ and $LYN^{up/up}$ mice show a breakdown in self-tolerance and develop circulating autoreactive autoantibodies and severe lupus-like nephritis (7,8,11) clearly demonstrates that Lyn is a key regulator of B cell signaling and suggests that any imbalance in signaling, either by deletion or activation, may result in severe autoimmunity.

CD45. The transmembrane CD45 phosphatase is expressed on all nucleated hematopoietic cells and constitutes up to 10% of all membrane proteins in T and B cells. It possesses an intracytoplasmic region bearing 2 domains, D1 and D2, and an extracellular domain with variable composition and structure that is due to alternative splicing of several exons and differential glycosylation. The function of CD45 in immunoreceptor signaling is to regulate the activity of the Src-family kinases by dephosphorylating their regulatory C-terminal tyrosine. It is thought that dimerization of CD45 inhibits PTP activity through symmetric interactions between its inhibitory structural domain and its catalytic site. Recently, the phenotype of a gain-of-function mutation in CD45 that may enhance the activity of the Src-family PTKs has been reported (12). Homozygous and heterozygous mice with a single point mutation, Glu613 to arginine, that inactivates the inhibitory wedge of CD45 exhibit polyclonal lymphocyte activation, lymphoproliferation, autoantibody production, and severe GN, resulting in death. These findings demonstrate the importance of negative regulation of CD45 in vivo and suggest that the level of activity of the Src-family PTKs is an important determinant of immune tolerance.

SHP-1. Also important in BCR signaling and in self-tolerance is SHP-1, a PTP with several targets in immunoreceptor signaling. Even in the absence of BCR coaggregation, SHP-1 can be recruited to CD22 or CD72. It also can dephosphorylate the ITAMs of Src kinases, Syk kinases, adapters such as SLP-76, and effectors such as Vav and PI 3-kinase, as well as receptors such as CD19. There is also strong evidence that SHP-1 can dephosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-containing receptors (described in more detail below), thereby providing a potential mechanism of autoregulation (1,2). A significant clue regarding the role of SHP-1 in immune cell

homeostasis was provided by the finding that its gene is mutated in motheaten ($m^{e}$) and viable motheaten ($m^{ev}$) mice (13, 14). The mutant mice exhibit a spontaneous point mutation in SHP-1 that results in a protein with decreased PTP activity (10–20% of normal activity) and immune defects, including expansion of B-1 cells, a low threshold of membrane Ig signaling, hypergammaglobulinemia, autoantibody production, and GN. The B cells of the mutant mice exhibit augmented BCR-induced proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and MAPK activation. Similar defects were observed in a B cell line expressing a dominant-negative form of SHP-1. Thus, SHP-1 is a critical negative regulator of immunoreceptor signaling in B cells.

Protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ). Members of the novel serine/threonine PKC family, which includes PKCδ, PKCε, PKCθ, and PKCη, can phosphorylate a multitude of cell substrates. Recent data suggest that the different family members have diverse roles in the immune system and are implicated in various cell processes, such as growth, differentiation, and death. Among the 12 known isoforms of PKCδ, several members are expressed in B lineage cells and activated by BCR stimulation, suggesting a contribution of PKCs in the transduction of B cell-mediated immune responses. One of these family members, PKCδ, is unique in that its overexpression can have a potent negative influence on cell behavior, by inhibiting cell proliferation and growth and enhancing cell death. This isoform is known to be highly expressed in B cells and to be involved in BCR signaling. It has the unusual property of being tyrosine phosphorylated, and this phosphorylation event takes place within a minute of BCR engagement. To understand its role in B cell immunity, mice deficient in PKCδ were analyzed (15, 16). The most overt abnormalities in these mice were splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, which were both attributed to an increase in the number of conventional B-2 cells. This augmentation was not observed in the bone marrow, indicating that it occurred in secondary lymphoid organs.

In the absence of antigen stimulation, PKCδ-deficient mice exhibit B cell expansion, formation of unusually high numbers of numerous germinal centers (GCs), and defective B cell tolerance to self antigen. With age, the B cell abnormalities have pathologic consequences, including increased concentrations of serum IgG1 and IgA, autoantibodies, IC-type GN, and lymphocyte perivascular infiltration in many organs. In addition, whereas short-term exposure of PKCδ-deficient B cells to self antigen elicits immunity, long-term stimulation with the same antigen fails to induce

tolerance via anergy, as it does for wild-type B cells (15), further underscoring the importance of PKCδ in negative regulation of B cell proliferation and in establishing B cell tolerance.

CD19. Cumulative evidence indicates that the CD19 coreceptor can induce positive signals that could enhance B cell responses (Figure 2). By regulating Src kinases and PI 3-kinase activity, CD19 lowers the threshold of BCR-mediated signaling. Strikingly, study of $CD19^{-/-}$ mice revealed an apparent tight regulation of CD19 cell surface density during B cell development (17). In contrast to mice that overexpress CD19, $CD19^{-/-}$ mice have a markedly elevated BCR signaling threshold as compared with wild-type mice. However, transgenic expression of low levels of human CD19 with normal levels of mouse CD19 resulted in hyperactive B cells and loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens (18). Since the product of PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP₃), activates PKB, which in turn promotes B cell survival, CD19 participates positively in B cell activation (Figure 2). Its positive effect on PI 3-kinase activity also may result in survival of immature B cells with low-affinity binding BCRs, and this could be a potential source of the autoreactivity seen in mice that have only a 15–30% increase in CD19 expression. The CD19-transgenic mice exhibit a profoundly different phenotype from that of normal controls and develop SLE-like manifestations, including anti-DNA antibodies.

Similar to mice that overexpress CD19, the tight-skin (TSK) mouse, a genetic model for human systemic sclerosis, also contains spontaneously activated B cells and autoantibodies against DNA topoisomerase I, double-stranded DNA, and histone. In TSK mice, $CD19$ deficiency results in quiescent B cells, with significantly reduced autoantibody production and presence of skin fibrosis (17). Thus, even subtle increases in CD19 density are sufficient to predispose mice to produce autoimmune manifestations, suggesting that modest alterations in CD19 expression could contribute to the development of autoantibodies in humans.

Regulation of BCR signaling by inhibitory coreceptors

As summarized above, the BCR represents a complex and highly regulated apparatus that enables proper B cell activation. Through coordinated expression of receptors, kinases, PTPs, and adapter molecules, the BCR is crucial for normal homeostasis, as exemplified by the observation that alterations of its components can result in autoimmune diseases.

Figure 2. Enhancement of B cell activation by C3d-containing immunocomplexes via complement receptor type 2 (CR2)/CD19. The B cell lineage-specific coreceptor CD19 appears on the surface of immature B cells. It is a member of the Ig superfamily and constitutes the signaling component of CR2, positively regulating B cell activation via recruitment of Lyn, PI3-K, and Vav to its associated signaling chain. Its intracellular tail contains several ITAM-like tyrosines. Upon BCR cross-linking, CD19 is phosphorylated by Lyn and, then, its ITAM-like motifs are consecutively phosphorylated by the CD19-bound Lyn. This recruitment is followed by binding of PI3-K and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav, resulting in amplification of downstream signals. See Figure 1 for other definitions.

to this overall activating module, B cells possess a complex and organized machinery aimed at restricting the duration and/or intensity of cell activation. Receptors that display negative signaling functions on lymphocytes are needed, not only for control of ongoing responses to foreign antigens, but also for self–non-self antigen discrimination. These inhibitory receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins that can be activated by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in their inhibitory motifs. Once phosphorylated, the inhibitory motifs bind various phosphatases (SHIP, SHP-1, and SHP-2), resulting in dominant-negative signals.

Fcγ receptors. FcγRIIb1. The prototypes of negative coreceptors are those that target the Fc region of IgG (Fcγ). By virtue of their broad tissue distribution, they have the ability to sense humoral concentrations of antibodies. Linking ligands with effector cells of the immune system, they initiate cellular responses that are useful in host defense (19,20). One of these receptors,

FcγRIIb1, is exclusively expressed on B cells and has the potential to terminate B cell signal transduction (Figure 3).

Importantly, IC-mediated FcγRIIb1 coaggregation with the BCR occurs in the microenvironment of the lymphoid follicle, where the IC concentration is sufficiently high to allow its interaction with the low-affinity FcγIIb1 receptor. Additionally, upon self ligation, the FcγRIIb1 can induce apoptosis in B lymphocytes, a mechanism that may promote deletion of low-affinity self-reactive B cells during affinity maturation in GCs (20). Therefore, FcγRIIb acts mainly in the periphery, regulating BCR-mediated activation and tolerizing low-affinity autoreactive cells that might be generated during somatic mutation or receptor editing (21). This potential to generate negative signaling by crosslinking of the BCR and FcγRIIb has been termed feedback suppression, or negative signaling, and is thought to regulate Ig production. Since T cells do not express

B LYMPHOCYTES AND AUTOIMMUNITY

Figure 3. Hypothetical model of Fcγ receptor IIb (FcγRIIb)–mediated inhibition of B cell activation. FcγRIIb is basically composed of 2 Ig-like extracellular domains, 1 transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail encoded by 3 exons. It has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) with the consensus sequence I/V/L/SxYxxL/V (see refs. 19 and 20). Upon cross-linking by immune complexes containing antigen with sufficient affinity for the BCR to promote activation, FcγRIIb associates with the BCR and its ITIM becomes phosphorylated by the activated Src-family kinase Lyn. In turn, phosphorylated ITIMs recruit the SH2 domains of SHIP and protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (see refs. 57 and 58). The activity of SHP-2 is redirected against the tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs on Gab1 that can bind and activate PI3-K. At the same time, SHIP dephosphorylates PIP₃ on the cell membrane. Dephosphorylation of this motif leads to a reduced PI3-K activity and lowers the membrane PIP₃ level, thus resulting in impaired PLCγ₂ activation, down-modulation of Ca²⁺ mobilization, and inhibition of cell proliferation. IP₃R = inositol trisphosphate receptor; SHC = Src homology and collagen (see Figure 1 for other definitions).

activating or inhibitory FcγR, these pathways function independently of T lymphocytes.

**FcγRIIb-mediated feedback suppression of autoimmunity.** The prediction that FcγR may control autoantibody production as well as IC-induced inflammation has been amply confirmed in studies of FcγR-deficient models. Ablation of *FcγRIIB* renders mice susceptible to the induction or spontaneous development of various autoimmune disorders, such as collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), Goodpasture syndrome, and GN, indicating that FcγRIIb is a critical component of peripheral tolerance (22). Significantly, although *FcγRIIB* deficiency results in production of anti-DNA and antichromatin antibodies as well as fatal autoimmune GN on the C57BL/6 background, *FcγRIIB⁻/⁻* BALB/c mice maintain tolerance to self antigen and are resistant to the development of autoimmunity. This strain-specific dependence suggests that *FcγRIIB* is a genetic susceptibility factor for autoimmunity, a conclusion further supported by studies showing that *FcγRIIB* deficiency can render a nonpermissive major histocompatibility complex haplotype susceptible to CIA, a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Whereas mice expressing a nonpermissive haplotype are resistant to CIA induction, *FcγRIIB⁻/⁻* mice immunized with type II collagen (CII) develop cellular and humoral immunity to collagen, resulting in destruction of the joints and inflammatory arthritis that can be transferred by immune serum. These data indicate that FcγRIIb negatively regulates both humoral immune responses and IC-mediated inflammation.

flammation, and plays a critical role in suppressing the induction of CIA.

The precise molecular mechanism for the synergistic effect of combinations of susceptibility alleles is poorly defined. MRL-lpr/lpr mice, a model for SLE and RA, have a FAS mutation that results in spontaneous development of systemic autoimmune diseases and a short life-span. Half of these mice die by 5–6 months of age due to massive progression of systemic autoimmune diseases, including lupus GN. However, the C57BL/6 (B6).Fas(lpr/lpr) strain does not develop such disorders within the normal life-span, indicating that suppressor genes in B6 mice may control the onset and exacerbation of disease. However, it is also possible that the MRL background plays a role in deterioration of the disease. In FCγRIIB−/− mice deficient in FAS (B6.IIB−/−Faslpr/lpr), the combined absence of FcγRIIB and FAS led to the development of systemic autoimmune diseases, including anti-DNA and anti-CII autoantibodies, and cryoglobulin production (23). The double-mutant mice were short-lived, due to enhanced autoantibody production, culminating in fatal IC-mediated lupus GN. Thus, FcγRIIB deletion with FAS mutation is sufficient to mediate systemic autoimmunity in B6 mice, implying that the FcγRIIB gene is a critical suppressor of SLE.

Polymorphisms of FcγR have been shown to have an impact on the induction and regulation of autoimmunity and on the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. In NZB and (NZB × NZW)F1 mice, FcγRIIb1 expression is abnormally down-regulated in follicular GC B cells from older mice (24). This reduced surface expression of FcγRIIb1 may be attributable to DNA polymorphism in the promoter region of the FcγRIIB gene (24, 25). During T cell-dependent humoral immune responses, antigen-activated B cells accumulate in GCs where Ig-class switching, somatic mutation, receptor revision, and generation of high-affinity IgG antibodies occur. Therefore, the FcγRIIB1 promoter allele may well be functioning to maintain and/or up-regulate FcγRIIb1 expression levels on GC B cells during the process of T cell-mediated activation in healthy strains of mice. Since lupus IgG anti-DNA antibodies in SLE are also affinity selected (26, 27) and must be, at least in part, generated in GCs, FcγRIIb1 down-regulation may represent a mechanism that allows high-affinity IgG autoantibodies to be overproduced by GC B cells that escape negative signals for IgG production.

CD22. CD22 is a B cell-specific transmembrane protein of the Ig superfamily, with 7 Ig-like domains and 3 cytoplasmic ITIMs, that functions as a BCR coreceptor. It first appears intracellularly during the late pro-B cell stage of ontogeny, shifting to the plasma membrane with B cell maturation, and then to plasma cells during plasma cell differentiation. CD22 is expressed at low levels on immature B cells, expressed at higher levels on mature IgM+, IgD+ B cells, and absent on terminally differentiated plasma cells. It acts as a homing receptor for recirculating B cells, probably through the affinity of its extracellular domain for 2,6-linked sialic acid-bearing glycans (28).

CD22 is associated with the BCR, both structurally and functionally. Upon BCR cross-linking, its cytoplasmic domain is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated, resulting in recruitment of a number of signaling molecules, including Lyn. In addition, tyrosine-phosphorylated CD22 recruits and activates the phosphatases SHP-1 and SHIP, leading to activation of a CD22/SHP-1/SHIP regulatory pathway that reduces both Ca2+ mobilization and MAPK activation and down-regulates CD19 phosphorylation and BCR-mediated signal transduction, leading to negative regulation of BCR signaling. It is thought that, by down-modulating BCR signaling, CD22 sets a threshold for BCR ligation.

Remarkably, the expression and function of CD22 are differentially regulated in conventional B-2 and B-1 cells. In CD5+ B-1 cells, which are involved in the production of natural antibodies and, possibly, pathogenic autoantibodies, CD22 levels are barely modulated after anti-IgM stimulation, but markedly down-regulated in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (29). In contrast to a strongly increased Ca2+ response of splenic CD22−/− B-2 cells, anti-IgM treatment does not trigger enhanced Ca2+ influx in CD22−/−; CD5+ B-1 cells (29). This may be related, in part, to the expression of CD5, which negatively controls BCR-mediated signaling, possibly by recruiting SHP-1. Thus, expression of CD22 is differentially regulated after BCR-mediated activation in B-1 and B-2 cells, which are apparently implicated in innate and adaptive immunity, respectively.

The in vitro studies suggesting that CD22 may help prevent unwanted activation of low-affinity, or autoreactive, B cells that could emerge as a result of somatic mutation in response to exogenous antigens are supported by several observations in vivo. Targeted disruption of the CD22 gene results in a hyperactive B cell phenotype, an impaired thymus-independent immune response, an expanded B-1 cell population, and increased titers of serum autoantibodies (30–32). Interestingly, as the CD22-deficient mice age, a large proportion of them develop high titers of serum IgG anti-DNA

antibodies (31). Thus, a single gene defect, found exclusively in B cells, suffices to trigger autoantibody production in mice.

Since dysregulated expression of CD22 could lead to excessive activation of B cells and autoantibody production, as seen in \(CD22^{-/-}\)mice, studies were performed to probe this coreceptor in systemic autoimmunity. Genome-wide mapping analysis of lupus susceptibility loci in autoimmune-prone NZW mice revealed that an interval containing the CD22 gene on chromosome 7 is linked with autoantibody production and lupus-like GN (33). Remarkably, one of the loci contributing to autoimmunity in New Zealand mixed (Sle3) mice has also been mapped to a region of chromosome 7 in the vicinity of CD22. These latter autoimmune mice produce aberrant CD22 messenger RNA species that result from alternative splicing due to an insertion in intron 1 of the CD22 gene (34). Heterozygous expression of this allele, called \(CD22^a\), promotes autoantibody production in mice bearing the Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration gene YAA (34), implying that even a partial CD22 deficiency may contribute to lupus susceptibility. This gene linkage appears to have functional consequences. Activation of B cells with LPS in the presence of interleukin-4 weakly up-regulated CD22 expression in NZW mice bearing the \(CD22^a\) allele, as compared with B6 mice bearing the \(CD22^b\) allele (33), suggesting that defective up-regulation of CD22 on potentially autoreactive B cells may favor the production of autoantibodies in lupus-prone mice.

PD-1. The recently identified CD28 homolog and costimulatory molecule PD-1 and its ligands, PD-1L and PD-2L, are homologs of B7 (35). PD-1 is a type 1 transmembrane protein that belongs to the Ig superfamily and is transcriptionally induced in activated T and B cells and myeloid cells. One of its cytoplasmic tyrosine residues lies within a consensus ITIM. In human tonsils, PD-1 is expressed on most T cells and on a small subset of centrocytes in the light zone of GCs, where clonal selection of centrocytes takes place, suggesting that PD-1 may play an important role in the GC reaction.

Because the sequence surrounding its N-terminal tyrosine residue fulfills the requirement of ITIM, it has been thought that PD-1 negatively regulates immune responses. Further studies showed that coligation of PD-1 with the BCR inhibited \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) mobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation of effector molecules, including IgB, Syk, PLC\(_{\gamma_2}\), and ERK-1/2, whereas phosphorylation of Lyn and Dok was not affected (36). PD-1 can inhibit BCR signaling by recruiting SHP-2 to its phosphotyrosine and dephosphorylating key BCR signaling

transducers. Because PD-1 is phosphorylated exclusively by coligation with the BCR and is expressed only on activated cells, it probably functions by down-modulating excessive and prolonged activation and inhibiting and/or suppressing inappropriate activation, such as occurs in autoimmunity, by elevating the threshold for restimulation.

These in vitro studies suggest that PD-1 acts to down-regulate immune responses and plays a critical role in establishment and/or maintenance of peripheral tolerance. Not surprisingly, ablation of PD-1 leads to breakdown of peripheral tolerance and to autoimmune diseases (36). Specifically, lack of PD-1 on a BALB/c background gives rise to a fatal autoantibody-mediated dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a life-threatening disease in humans for which only heart transplantation is effective (35). This disease is mediated by an autoantibody reactive to a heart-specific 30-kd protein. Because ligands for PD-1 are strongly expressed in the heart and the antigen recognized by the autoantibody is strictly restricted to the heart, the direct interaction between PD-1L + heart tissue and PD-1 + preactivated B cells normally prevents this pathologic process from occurring by inhibiting autoreactive B cells at the effector site. In contrast, on a C57BL/6 background, PD-1 deficiency results in spontaneous, typical lupus-like GN and destructive arthritis (37). These studies reinforce the notion that, in genetically predisposed individuals, dysfunction of PD-1 may underlie distinct types of autoimmune diseases.

PECAM-1 (CD31). PECAM-1 (CD31) represents a new B cell coreceptor that serves to negatively regulate BCR signaling and B cell tolerance in vivo. It is a 130-kd glycoprotein and a member of the Ig superfamily. In humans, it is expressed at the lateral junctions of endothelial cells and on the surface of hematopoietic cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, natural killer cells, platelets, and naive B and T cells. In the B cell lineage, PECAM-1 is expressed on human naive follicular mantle zone B cells and plasma cells, but not on GC memory B cells. Its cytoplasmic domain contains 2 ITIMs that, upon phosphorylation of the putative tyrosine residues, recruit and activate the PTPs SHP-1 and SHP-2 (38). In this manner, PECAM-1 might negatively regulate BCR signaling.

The inhibitory effects observed in vitro in response to cross-linking suggest that PECAM-1 is an important regulator of antigen-induced lymphocyte activation. Studies in vivo demonstrate that PECAM-1 has a functional immunomodulatory role, thereby adding a new B cell coreceptor to the list of known negative

regulators of BCR-mediated signaling (39). PECAM-1 mice exhibit a developmental defect in the transition from immature to mature B cells, increased numbers of B-1a cells in the peritoneum, reduced levels of recirculating mature B-2 cells in the periphery, hyperresponsive B cells in response to BCR cross-linking and polyclonal stimulation with LPS, and elevated antibody responses to T cell-independent antigens. With age, autoantibodies, IC-mediated GN, and lupus-like autoimmune diseases are seen (39). These findings are consistent with PECAM-1 serving to negatively regulate the signaling threshold of early B cell activation initiated through the BCR complex, which directs downstream effector functions, including B cell proliferation (39). It may contribute to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance and protection from autoimmunity.

**BCR signaling alterations in humans**

As discussed above, experimentally induced modification of receptor expression or alteration of signaling pathways may have a significant impact on B cell tolerance to self antigens. There are indications that abnormal B cell signaling may contribute to autoimmune diseases in humans as well. In patients with lupus, stimulation of circulating B cells through their surface IgM (sIgM) produces significantly higher Ca²⁺ fluxes as compared with similarly induced responses of B cells from patients with other systemic rheumatic diseases (40). The overall level of sIgM-initiated protein tyrosyl phosphorylation was also significantly enhanced in peripheral B lymphocytes, and correlated with the augmented BCR-mediated, free Ca²⁺ responses. This aberrant BCR-mediated signaling process was not associated with disease activity, medications used, or specific clinical manifestations. It was disease specific, suggesting a possible B cell defect intrinsic to SLE that may have pathogenic implications.

In further studies, the content of Lyn, CD45, and SHP-1 in lupus B cells was found to be significantly altered in patients (41, 42). Investigation of gene polymorphisms in the Japanese population suggested that CD22 could be considered a candidate susceptibility gene for autoimmune diseases (43). Although the function of the CD22/Lyn signaling-inhibitor complex was not addressed (41, 42), it is likely that the decreased expression of Lyn in SLE B cells may contribute to the B cell overactivity. Consistent with studies in rodents showing that a 20% overexpression of CD19 induced autoantibody production in normal mice, expression of CD19 and CD21 levels were shown to be 20% higher on

B cells from patients with systemic sclerosis compared with healthy individuals (17). In Japanese patients with SLE, a CD19 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which was rare in Caucasians, was increased (44).

A particular feature of human autoimmune diseases is the wide variety of affected organs, the diversity of immune responses involved, the distinctive phenotypes over the time course of the disease, the severity of the disease, and the response to medication. It is possible that genetic predisposition contributes to determination of the pathogenic process, a view supported by the strain-dependency of disease manifestations observed in mice deficient in inhibitory BCR coreceptors. In human autoimmunity, studies of FcγRIIB and PD-1 also point to an important link with autoimmune diseases.

Initial support for a pivotal role of FcγRIIB polymorphisms as susceptibility alleles in the pathogenesis of SLE came from mapping of a region in the telomere of human chromosome 1 (45). This region is syntenic to a region on mouse chromosome 1 in the vicinity of the FcγRIIB1 locus (33) and encodes a variety of immunologically relevant molecules, including FcγRIIb and FcγRIII, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. More recently, the frequency of an SNP (695T/C) coding for a nonsynonymous Ile²³²/Thr substitution within the transmembrane domain of FcγRIIb was significantly increased in Japanese patients with SLE compared with healthy individuals (46). It is of further interest that another allele, called FCGR2B-187T, that mediates a higher level of CD19 dephosphorylation and a greater degree of inhibition of the Ca²⁺ response when coengaged with the BCR than does FCGR2B-187I, is not associated with SLE in both African Americans and Caucasians (47). This lack of association raises the interesting possibility that FCGR2B-187T may be interacting epistatically with background genes that differ between Japanese patients and both African American and Caucasian patients.

In the mouse, PD-1 appears to inhibit immune responses in vivo, and abrogation of this inhibition could result in development of autoimmune diseases. This conclusion is supported by gene-mapping studies of patients, in which an intronic SNP in PD-1 was reportedly associated with SLE in 12% of Europeans and 7% of Mexicans (48). The identified allele alters a binding site for a transcription factor located in an intronic enhancer and could lead to aberrant regulation of PD-1 and, thus, dysregulated self-tolerance. These data suggest a mechanism through which PD-1 can contribute to the development of SLE in humans (48).

Overall, studies of mouse models reveal that

subtle alterations in overlapping signaling pathways that influence B cell responses to transmembrane and intracellular signals are sufficient to predispose mice to autoantibody production. It will be important to probe additional signal transduction pathways in patients with autoimmunity. For example, given that the lack of PKCδ leads to autoimmunity in mice, it is possible that the activity of PKCδ is reduced in the cells of humans with certain autoimmune diseases. Moreover, strikingly similar abnormalities of antigen-receptor signaling have previously been reported in T cells from patients with SLE (4, 49), thus indicating the potential for common antigen receptor-mediated signaling defects in lupus lymphocytes (4, 50, 51). Accordingly, the signaling abnormalities encountered in SLE lymphocytes may provide a biochemical and molecular background for such diverse abnormalities as lymphocyte activation, anergy, and cell death (3, 4).

### Implications for therapy

Therapy for severe autoimmune diseases has primarily consisted of broadly immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporin A, and corticosteroids. Although survival rates have improved dramatically, none of these therapies offers a cure, and most of them have significant toxicity. The demonstration that B lymphocytes could play a central role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases suggests that blockade and/or elimination of these cells may be a highly beneficial therapeutic goal in a variety of disorders. One possibility is to interfere with the induction and maintenance of GC reactions that produce autoantigen-specific memory and Ig-secreting plasma cells by blocking CD40-CD154 interactions. Results from a recent uncontrolled open-label study showed that treatment of SLE with a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) to CD154 (BG9588, 5c8) significantly reduced serum autoantibodies and proteinuria, and also reduced the disease activity score on the SLE Disease Activity Index (52). Whereas the antibody used in these studies elicited an increase in the frequency of thrombotic events, and thus conferred unacceptable side effects, the use of another mAb to CD154 (24-31, IDEC-131) in SLE is apparently not associated with an increased frequency of thrombosis, although minimal efficacy of this latter mAb has been noted (53).

Recently, therapies aimed at specifically reducing B cell numbers have received much attention. B lymphocyte depletion by a chimeric anti-CD20 mAb that targets B cells from the pre-B cell to the mature B cell stages

has been used in a number of autoimmune conditions, including autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), RA, SLE, myasthenia gravis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and dermatomyositis (54). In many of these conditions, major improvement is seen in a good proportion of cases, particularly in RA, SLE, dermatomyositis, autoimmune neuropathies, ITP, and hemolytic anemia.

Other potential targets for treating autoimmune diseases include a strategy directed at signaling pathways. Although the mechanisms underlying the abnormal expression of BCR- and TCR-associated molecules remain the focus of investigation, the available evidence might provide the basis for novel therapeutic approaches. Since subtle alterations in overlapping signaling pathways that influence B cell responses to transmembrane and intracellular signals are sufficient to predispose mice to autoantibody production, it should be possible to achieve therapeutic benefit by attenuating specific signaling pathways and B cell responses to transmembrane signals, without physically eliminating humoral immunity. Considering the important role of signaling amplifiers (CD19) in regulation of B cell function, it is conceivable that antagonists of their function will be evaluated in human clinical trials.

For example, the development of therapeutic mAb that block CD19 engagement may have considerable benefit for the treatment of autoimmunity. If aberrations in PKCδ expression and/or activity in B cells turn out to be associated with the development of certain human autoimmune diseases, agents that modulate PKCδ activity would have therapeutic value in such individuals. Conversely, the identification of signaling down-modulators (CD22, PD-1, CD32, CD31, CD72) that function as response regulators by inhibiting and/or terminating BCR signaling may offer promising novel immunointervention strategies. It is conceivable that, for example, proper coligation of autoreactive BCRs and negative signaling coreceptors may allow modulation of autoimmunity.

Finally, it is likely that further studies will uncover additional associated regulatory molecules or signaling substrates in B and T cells from patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. Because it is known that there is a tight regulation of PTKs and PTPs, it is possible that a more complete understanding of the role of the activating signals in comparison with the inhibitory signals may lead to identification of the best targets for therapy and design of novel approaches to modulate lymphocyte function. The results of experiments using a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis, showing that

inhibition of a transcription factor is sufficient to block generalized symptoms of the disease and to specifically arrest bone erosion (55), make it tempting to speculate that manipulation of signaling pathways may open up a range of avenues to design novel approaches for immunomodulation. One possibility is that some of these molecules may serve as targets for immune intervention, and if it turns out that the disease is caused by a major signaling defect, it is conceivable that the use of specific inhibitors of PTKs (56) or PTPs may modulate the autoimmune response and thus alleviate the signs and symptoms of systemic autoimmune disease.
