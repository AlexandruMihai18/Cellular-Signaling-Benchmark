# A parallel circuit of LIF signalling pathways maintains pluripotency of mouse ES cells

The cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) integrates signals into mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to maintain pluripotency. Although the Jak–Stat3 pathway is essential and sufficient to mediate LIF signals${}^{1,2}$, it is still unclear how these signals are linked to the core circuitry of pluripotency-associated transcription factors, consisting of Oct3/4 (also called Pou5f1), Sox2 and Nanog${}^{3,4}$. Here we show that two LIF signalling pathways are each connected to the core circuitry via different transcription factors. In mouse ES cells, Klf4 is mainly activated by the Jak–Stat3 pathway and preferentially activates Sox2, whereas Tbx3 is preferentially regulated by the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase–Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and predominantly stimulates Nanog. In the absence of LIF, artificial expression of Klf4 or Tbx3 is sufficient to maintain pluripotency while maintaining the expression of Oct3/4. Notably, overexpression of Nanog supports LIF-independent self-renewal of mouse ES cells in the absence of Klf4 and Tbx3 activity. Therefore, Klf4 and Tbx3 are involved in mediating LIF signalling to the core circuitry but are not directly associated with the maintenance of pluripotency, because ES cells keep pluripotency without their expression in the particular context.

Self-renewal of mouse ES cells under conventional culture conditions depends on the LIF-induced activation of the signal transducer Gp130, with withdrawal of LIF resulting in the induction of differentiation${}^{5}$. In the absence of LIF, either the artificial activation of Stat3 (ref. 2) or the overexpression of Nanog${}^{6,7}$ is sufficient to support ES self-renewal. Stat3 is activated by Jak kinase associated with Gp130, but the connection between Stat3 and Nanog has not been confirmed. Bioinformatic studies have identified several transcription factors as the putative targets of the core circuitry transcription factor Oct3/4 (ref. 8). Of these transcription factors, Klf4 and Tbx3 were found to possess the ability to support self-renewal of E14tg2a-derived Rex1-Gfp-BSD/Oct3/4-Ecfp-pac ES cells (hereafter called OCRG9 cells)${}^{9}$ in the absence of LIF, comparable to that of Nanog (Fig. 1a). These ES cells proliferate in the presence of puromycin, indicating active transcription from the Oct3/4 promoter, but express GFP from the Rex1 (also called Zfp42) promoter at lower frequency than the parental OCRG9 ES cells. Klf4 encodes a krüppel-like zinc-finger transcription factor, which is required for the establishment of pluripotency in somatic cells${}^{10}$, delays differentiation in embryoid body culture${}^{11}$, and acts as a cofactor of Oct3/4 and Sox2 to activate a particular set of target genes${}^{12}$. Tbx3 encodes T-box transcription factors, which are probably required to maintain pluripotency, as suggested by RNA-interference-mediated loss-of-function assays${}^{13}$. Transfection of one of these genes into CCE-derived MGZ5 ES cells${}^{14}$ using the integrated copy of the transgene also resulted in the reproducible derivation of LIF-independent clones (data not shown). However, no stable transfectants were recovered when MGZ5 ES cells were transfected with Tbx3 and Klf4 using the episomal vector system that confers high expression level of the transgene${}^{1}$, indicating the tight dosage effect of these genes (data not shown).

The morphology of ES cells supported by Klf4, Tbx3 or Nanog (hereafter called Klf4-, Tbx3- or Nanog-ES cells, respectively) in the absence of LIF is indistinguishable from that of parental ES cells cultured with LIF (Fig. 1b). These cells continue to propagate for more than 1 month while maintaining constant proliferation ratios slightly slower than that of parental ES cells cultured with LIF (Fig. 1c). When the floxed transgene of Klf4 (Fig. 1d) was transfected

into ES cells, these cells continued to propagate in the absence of LIF for 1 month. When the expression vector for cre recombinase was transiently transfected into these cells to excise the floxed Klf4 transgene, the DsRed transgene was activated and the cells became LIF dependent and recovered the ability to generate normal embryoid bodies (data not shown). When these ES cells were injected into blastocysts, followed by transplantation into the uteri of pseudopregnant mice, they gave rise to chimaeric embryos in which DsRed-expressing cells contributed to the entire embryonic part (Fig. 1e). Similar results were observed for Tbx3 (Supplementary Fig. 1). In both cases, before transgene excision, the transgenic ES cells were resistant to treatment with a Jak inhibitor or to stable expression of Stat3F (ref. 1), the dominant-negative form of Stat3, in the absence of LIF (data not shown). These results confirm that, as with Nanog⁶⁷, the expression of Klf4 or Tbx3 is absolutely sufficient to support self-renewal of ES cells in the absence of LIF.

To determine how these three transcription factors, which have the same activity, connect with each other, we measured expression levels of each endogenous transcript in transgenic ES cells cultured in the absence of LIF for 4 days (Fig. 2a). Downregulation of Socs3, a direct target of Stat3 (ref. 15), as well as the loss of active Stat3 (Fig. 2c) confirmed the removal of the LIF signal. Oct3/4 expression was maintained at its normal level¹⁶ in all three transgenic ES cell lines. In contrast, Sox2 expression level in Nanog- and Tbx3-ES cells was comparable to that in ES cells cultured in the absence of LIF for 4 days, suggesting that its expression is not maintained; Nanog is maintained only in Tbx3-ES cells. Because we previously found that the unique function of Sox2 is the maintenance of Oct3/4 expression¹⁷, these

results suggest that Nanog has the ability to maintain Oct3/4 independent of Sox2, as previously suggested¹⁸, in Tbx3- and Nanog-ES cells. Tbx3 expression was maintained in Tbx3-ES cells, but not in Klf4- and Nanog-ES cells, and Klf4 expression was not maintained in all three transgenic ES cells. These characteristic expression patterns of Tbx3, Klf4 and Nanog in each transgenic ES cell line were confirmed by protein expression levels (Fig. 2b). These findings suggest that there is a hierarchy in the functions of these transcription factors, in which Tbx3 and Klf4 are upstream whereas Nanog is downstream of Tbx3, to activate Oct3/4 expression for proper self-renewal. Indeed, the hierarchical regulations of multiple pluripotency-associated genes were observed in the transgenic ES cells, in which some were commonly maintained but others were not (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Immunostaining of ES cells with specific antibodies showed that Tbx3, Klf4 and Nanog were heterogeneously expressed (Fig. 2d). To characterize their expression pattern, we applied the Rex1 marker system to distinguish two subpopulations in ES cells⁹. In OCRG9 ES cells, as previously reported, 80% of ES cells express GFP, which monitors Rex1 expression. We found that 75%, 50% and 30% of ES cells express Klf4, Nanog and Tbx3, respectively (Fig. 2e), and that their expression was not always coordinated, although 24% of cells were triple-positive (Fig. 2f). Such obscure correlation between their nuclear localization patterns might reflect the fact that their complex regulation does not simply depend on the LIF-dependent cascade in the conventional culture condition but is also modulated by other signals. In contrast, Oct3/4 expression was quite homogeneous, as determined by monitoring the Oct3/4–CFP fusion product expressed from the modified genomic allele (Fig. 2d). Therefore, the fluctuating

expression of the upstream transcription factors converged to a constant expression, maintaining a steady state of self-renewal.

The ability to replace the requirement for LIF suggests that these transcription factors have physiological properties, even in the presence of LIF signalling. To test these properties, we evaluated the rapid transcriptional responsiveness to the activation of the LIF signal in ES cells. ES cells were cultured without LIF for 21 h to remove the LIF signal, resulting in significant repression of Socs3, Klf4, Tbx3 and Nanog expression, but not Oct3/4 and Sox2 expression (Fig. 3a). LIF was subsequently added and the expression levels of these genes were monitored (Fig. 3b). Socs3, a direct target of Stat3, was upregulated at 0.5 h, decreased at 2 h and then maintained at a moderate level. Klf4 showed a similar time course, although its magnitude of upregulation was smaller. In contrast, Tbx3 and Nanog showed no significant response to LIF in this time period. These data suggest that Klf4 looks most closely regulated by the LIF signal in these three genes.

We also assessed the intracellular signal pathways involved in activation of each gene. The LIF signal has been shown to activate three pathways: Jak–Stat3, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)–Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)¹⁹. Among them, the Jak–Stat3 pathway is solely regulated by LIF in ES cells, but the other two are regulated by multiple pathways. We incubated cells with specific inhibitors of each pathway before LIF stimulation, confirmed the effects by western blot of the signal components (Supplementary Fig. 3), and assessed their effects on early induction events (Fig. 3c). Upregulation of Socs3 at 1 h was completely cancelled by the Jak inhibitor but not by the others, indicating that Socs3 expression is solely dependent on the Jak–Stat3 pathway. Upregulation of Klf4 was also specifically prevented by the Jak inhibitor. Notably, the MAPK-kinase (MAPKK) inhibitor upregulated Tbx3 and Nanog at 24 h (Fig. 3c). Differential dependence on the Jak–Stat3 pathway was confirmed by direct modulation of Stat3 activity in ES cells. ES cells carrying a Stat3ER transgene, which is activated by 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4HT)², were cultured with or without 4HT in the absence of LIF for 4 days and the gene expression levels were compared to that of the cells cultured in the presence of LIF. This comparison revealed that Socs3 and Klf4 were maintained by Stat3ER but Tbx3 and Nanog were not (Fig. 3d). In contrast, when the Stat3 activity was inhibited by transient overexpression of the dominant-negative form of Stat3 (ref. 1), Socs3, Klf4 and Nanog were significantly repressed but Tbx3 expression was not affected (Fig. 3e). These data indicate that Tbx3 expression is not mainly regulated by Stat3.

The PI(3)K–Akt pathway is partly regulated by LIF but is also activated by the insulin/insulin-like growth factor as well as the constitutive activity of Eras in ES cells²⁰. To test its impact on the pattern of gene expression, we analysed the gene expression pattern in ES cells maintained by a constitutively active form of Akt with a myristoylated signal in the absence of LIF²¹. In these ES cells, Tbx3 and Nanog, as well as Oct3/4, showed normal expression, whereas Klf4 and Sox2 were not maintained (Fig. 3f). The expression pattern of these genes as well as other markers is quite similar to that of Tbx3-ES cells (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2). These observations are consistent with the report that Nanog is regulated by the PI(3)K–Akt pathway²². Moreover, they strongly suggest that Tbx3 expression is partly regulated by the PI(3)K–Akt pathway under the control of the LIF signal.

Why were Tbx3 and Nanog upregulated at the late stage by LIF in the presence of MAPKK inhibitor? The MAPK pathway was recently shown to be activated by the FGF signal in ES cells, destabilizing its pluripotent state; complete blockage of MAPKK in combination with inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) was sufficient to support self-renewal in the absence of LIF²³. We found that Tbx3 and Nanog were well maintained in ES cells cultured in this condition (Fig. 3g), and inhibition of MAPKK resulted in the accumulation of Tbx3 protein in nuclei from 8 h (data not shown) and reached to the maximum level after 24 h (Fig. 3h). Because Tbx3-ES cells express

endogenous Tbx3 (Fig. 2a), Tbx3 might be positively autoregulated. Therefore, if the MAPK pathway stimulates the nuclear export of Tbx3, its inhibition would result in the nuclear accumulation of Tbx3, resulting in the maintenance of its expression via autoregulation. The nuclear localization of Tbx3 may be regulated by multiple signals, as accumulation of Tbx3 protein in nuclei was also observed in ES cells cultured on feeder cells, and the stimulation of nuclear localization of Tbx3 protein is dependent on protein synthesis (data not shown).

We have shown that the LIF signal is integrated into the core regulatory circuitry of pluripotency via two parallel pathways: the Jak–Stat3, which activates Klf4 and then Sox2 but not Nanog, and the PI(3)K–Akt pathway, which activates Tbx3 and then preferentially Nanog (Fig. 4). These pathways should be regarded as the principal ones; however, there should also be some minor pathways because Sox2 regulation is not completely exclusive and the long-term culture of ES cells supported by Stat3ER without LIF resulted in the recovery of a normal gene expression pattern (Fig. 3f). The regulation of proliferation is separable from these parallel pathways because the activation of both by the transgenic expression of Tbx3 and Klf4 was not sufficient to recover the normal growth ratio, although Stat3ER-ES cells can proliferate normally in the absence of LIF (data not shown). Construction of such parallel circuitry might confer robustness on the transcription factor network, making Klf4, Tbx3 and Nanog dispensable in ES cells and/or early embryogenesis²⁴–²⁶. This dispensability may also be due to the overlapping function of similar molecules, because Klf2, Tbx4 (data not shown) and Klf5 (ref. 27) can also support LIF-independent self-renewal. The function of Klf4 and Tbx3 may therefore be limited to their connection of the LIF signal with the core circuitry, because Oct3/4 is maintained without activation of Klf4 and Tbx3 in Nanog-ES cells. Notably, a similar expression pattern has been observed in epiblast-derived pluripotent stem cells (EpiSCs) derived from primitive ectoderm, which were maintained by activin and Fgf2²⁸, consistent with the expression of Oct3/4, Sox2 and Nanog, suggesting that different sets of transcription factors can bridge the various extracellular signals and the unique core transcription factors. Indeed, the recent reports show that Nanog expression is maintained by the Smad2/3 pathway under the control of activin in

Figure 4 | Diagram of the parallel circuitry of the LIF signal pathways integrating into the transcription factor network. The Jak–Stat3 pathway activates Klf4, whereas the PI(3)K–Akt pathway stimulates the transcription of Tbx3. The MAPK pathway antagonizes the nuclear localization of Tbx3. Klf4 and Tbx3 mainly activate Sox2 and Nanog, respectively, and maintain expression of Oct3/4. Transcription of all these transcription factors is positively regulated by Oct3/4, Sox2 and Nanog, which may confer robustness and stable expression in the absence of all signals.
EpiSCs<sup>29</sup>. Such a functional hierarchy of transcription factors might explain the robustness of the transcription factor network in maintaining pluripotency. To our knowledge, this is the first dissection of the functional hierarchy of transcription factors that maintains self-renewal of mouse ES cells.

**METHODS SUMMARY**

Construction of expression vectors. Mouse *Klf4* and *Tbx3* cDNAs were amplified from ES cell cDNA using the primers shown in Supplementary Table 1. These cDNAs were subsequently sequenced and subcloned into pCAG-IP<sup>14</sup>, pCAG-IN (in which *pac* in pCAG-IP was replaced by *neo*), and pCAG-flox-DsRedT4-IP<sup>30</sup> expression vectors.

ES cell culture. All ES cell cultures, stable transfections and chimaera formations were performed as described<sup>30</sup>. Selection drugs, inducers and inhibitors were used at the following concentrations: 1 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> puromycin (Sigma); 150 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> G418 (Sigma); 1 μM 4HT (Sigma); 10 μM Jak inhibitor I (Carbiochem); 5 μM LY294002 (Sigma); 25 μM PD98059 (Promega); 10 μM U0126 (Carbiochem).

Quantitative PCR. To quantify the amounts of transcripts, cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using ReverTra Ace (Toyobo), and cDNA aliquots equivalent to 2.5 ng RNA were evaluated by quantitative PCR using a BioRad iCycler and the primers in Supplementary Table 1. All samples were tested in triplicate, and the results of each were normalized relative to *Gapdh* expression. The mean relative amounts of each transcript were calculated.
