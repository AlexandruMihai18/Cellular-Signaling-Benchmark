#### ABSTRACT

The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age today. Women with PCOS often demonstrate defective ovarian steroid biosynthesis and present with hyperandrogenemia. Moreover, 50–70% of PCOS women are insulin resistant and hyperinsulinemic. Insulin acts on the ovary via its own receptor and interacts with gonadotrophins, modulating steroidogenesis. The precise role of insulin and the molecular mechanisms that take place are not yet completely explicated. This review will be focused on insulin’s action on the ovary and other target tissues, describing the intracellular signaling pathways implicated in steroidogenesis and their defects in women with PCOS.

The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrinopathies in women of reproductive age and its prevalence is estimated to be approximately 7% [1,2]. The etiology is unknown and it seems to be multifactorial, consisting of genetic and environmental components [3]. The syndrome was considered to be mainly a reproductive disorder, but important data have highlighted its metabolic implications. It seems that insulin plays a central role in the pathogenesis of PCOS; therefore insulin’s actions in its target tissues as well as in the ovary have been systematically studied [4].

Insulin resistance and subsequent hyperinsulinemia are found in 50–70% of PCOS women [5]. Hyperinsulinemia has been correlated with high androgens levels and anovulation. Moreover, reduction of insulin levels with administration of insulin sensitizing agents has been found to be beneficial in lowering both hyperinsulinemia, hyperandrogenemia, and restoring ovulation in many cases of women with the syndrome [6–9].

The role of insulin alone as well as its interactions in the regulation of genes and steroid biosynthesis has been examined in an effort to shed some light in the molecular mechanisms that are implicated in the defective steroidogenesis in PCOS. Insulin mediated increase in ovarian steroidogenesis is achieved through enhanced expression of genes, enzymes and proteins that are crucial for the steroidogenic machinery. The molecules that contribute to steroidogenesis include low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cAMP, cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (P450scc), 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), and 17α-hydroxylase/C$_{17-20}$ lyase cytochrome P450 (P450c17), aromatase cytochrome P450 and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD). The regulation of ovarian steroid synthesis depends on the expression and activity of these components.

The molecular mechanisms that appear to be implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of PCOS are not yet conclusive as to a certain abnormality and most studies point to the direction that there are more than one responsible defective mechanisms taking place. This review will mainly focus on insulin’s intracellular pathways in the human ovarian tissue, in peripheral target tissues and their role in PCOS.

The insulin receptor (IR) is a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular α- subunits and two transmembrane β-subunits. The binding of insulin to the α-subunit of the IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the β-subunit of the receptor, triggering the signaling cascades, i.e. the MAP kinase and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). The MAP kinase pathway is thought to be primarily responsible for the control of growth and development, whereas the PI3-kinase pathway is involved in growth, anti-apoptosis and metabolic signaling (glucose uptake and utilization) [10–12].

Fibroblast cultures have been used in an attempt to exclude environmental factors influencing the insulin action in them. The number and the affinity of the insulin receptors have been found normal in adipose tissue, both [13–15] in muscle [16,17] and fibroblast cells [18,19] from PCOS patients. Isolated adipocytes from PCOS women showed a significant rightward shift in the insulin dose-response curve for glucose transport stimulation [13]. Adipose tissue of PCOS women also exhibited a defect in glucose uptake, i.e. a decrease was found in both obese and nonobese women with PCOS in vivo and in isolated adipocytes [15]. Rosenbaum et al. reported a decrease in maximal insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes of women with PCOS [20], a defect that was not, however, confirmed by Ciaraldi et al. [13]. Moreover, Lystedt et al. found a normal insulin dose-response curve along with diminished maximal insulin-stimulated glucose transport in subcutaneous adipocytes of obese PCOS women [21]. Ciaraldi et al. also showed decreased maximal insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation with no apparent defect in receptor kinase activity [13]. When steps downstream where investigated, a decrease in IRS-1 tyrosine expression and phosphorylation in insulin resistant PCOS women were found [22] but Wang et al. confirmed only decreased IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation [23]. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 of insulin resistant PCOS patients was also decreased compared to patients without insulin resistance and healthy controls [24]. GLUT-4 glucose transporters' abundance was found significantly decreased in PCOS adipocytes, independent of obesity providing a possible mechanism for the aforesaid decreased maximal insulin-stimulated rate of glucose uptake [20]. In 50% of PCOS women fibroblast cultures, an increase of basal autophosphorylation of serine residues together with a decrease in insulin-stimulated tyrosine autophosphorylation of the β-subunit of the IRs was described [18]. The factor or factors causing serine phosphorylation of the β-subunit of IR are not yet identified and since there are no mutations in the IR gene described that could relate to the latter abnormality, a hypothesis of a responsible extrinsic factor, perhaps a serine kinase could be assumed. Interestingly, Li et al. pretreated cultured fibroblast cells of PCOS-Ser women with inhibitors of serine kinase and showed that decreased tyrosine autophosphorylation reversed when a nonselective protein kinase inhibitor was added [25]. Fibroblast cultures from women who did not display the increased serine autophosphorylation demonstrated normal basal and insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of IRs [18].

Insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis in cultured skin fibroblasts of PCOS women was found reduced while insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation was normal, suggesting a selective abnormality present only in the metabolic, and not in the mitogenic actions of insulin in these cells [19]. Also, IRS-1-associated PI3K activation was found normal in cultured fibroblasts [19] so the defect leading to reduced glycogen synthesis could perhaps take place in another signaling pathway or at a step downstream of IRS-1-mediated PI3K activation [19]. On the other hand, Ciaraldi et al. did not find decreased insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis in fibroblast cultures of insulin resistant PCOS patients, suggesting possibly tissue specificity [14]. Another defect was found in GSK-3 phosphorylation where a decrease was apparent, explaining to a certain degree the decreased activation of glycogen synthase and diminished glycogen synthesis [26].

In vivo and in vitro studies of skeletal muscle of PCOS patients revealed a discrepancy in the findings, implying that environmental influence, may play a role. In vivo studies of skeletal muscle showed a significant decrease in insulin-mediated glucose uptake along with a decrease in insulin-mediated IRS-1-associated PI3K activity. However, the abundance of IRS-2 was significantly increased, suggesting a compensatory change to decreased insulin-mediated

IRS-1-associated PI3K activity. Insulin-mediated glucose uptake was found to be decreased [17].

Corbould et al. did not confirm the decreased glucose uptake in cultured skeletal muscle from insulin resistant obese PCOS patients [16]. The authors did not find a decrease in insulin-mediated glucose uptake, basal autophosphorylation or insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-subunit of the IR [16]. IRS-1 abundance was increased by 35% and when alterations of increased IRS-1 were not taken into account, IRS-1-associated PI3K activity and the association of p85 with IRS-1 were found normal [16]. However, after adjustment for IRS-1 abundance, IRS-1-associated PI3K activity was found diminished in cultured skeletal muscle in PCOS patients [16]. Moreover, baseline IRS-2-associated PI3K activity was reduced and a tendency of reduction in insulin-stimulated IRS-2-associated PI3K activity was also found [16]. The abundance of IRS-1 phospho-Ser³¹² was increased, a finding not confirmed in fibroblast cultures. Ser³¹² is a critical site and its phosphorylation inhibits insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 [16]. GLUT-4 abundance was normal in skeletal muscles of PCOS patients but GLUT-1 abundance was higher in skeletal muscles from PCOS women positively correlating with increased basal glucose uptake in PCOS skeletal muscle [16].

The main reproductive clinical abnormalities in PCOS, hyperandrogenemia and anovulation, are linked to ovarian dysfunction and the role of insulin on this tissue appears to be critical.

### 2. Ovaries

Cholesterol is the universal substrate for steroid biosynthesis. LDL is the major source of cholesterol in humans and is transported into ovarian cells via the LDL receptor pathway [27]. It has been found that in cultures of granulosa cells, gonadotrophins stimulate LDL receptor protein and gene expression [28–30]. Interestingly, insulin adds to this action of LH and FSH [31]. It is noteworthy to clarify the mediatory role of LH and insulin to the regulation of LDL receptor gene expression. Sekar et al. [32] demonstrated that LH and insulin synergistically can up-regulate LDL receptor transcriptional activity supraadditively in porcine granulosa-luteal cells via intracellular mechanisms that include the protein kinase A (PKA), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways (Fig. 1).

The rate-limiting step in ovarian steroid hormone synthesis (as well as in adrenal cortical and Leydig cells) requires the steroid acute regulatory (StAR) protein in order to transport cholesterol to the intramitochondrial enzyme P450scc. The latter converts cholesterol to pregnenolone. Steroidogenesis is partly controlled by StAR and CYP17 genes and their regulation by LH and insulin has been studied both individually and in concomitant administration (Fig. 1). The synergistic interaction of LH and insulin in steroidogenesis has been investigated in vitro studies, where LH and insulin were co-administrated in cultured porcine theca cells [33]. The authors found that LH and insulin augmented theca cell biosynthesis of androstenedione and progesterone as well as increased mRNA of both StAR and CYP17 individually and synergistically. Moreover, in order to assess gene transcriptional activity, StAR and CYP17 hnRNA were measured and a significant increase was found by LH and insulin and their combination [33]. The bihormonal synergistic enhancement of steroid biosynthesis implies an interaction between these two molecules, which was further more studied by the addition of a stable analogue of cAMP (8-Br-cAMP). The administration of this analogue exhibited the same effect of increased steroid biosynthesis and StAR and CYP17 gene expression [33]. However, when this analogue was co-administrated with insulin, only increased progesterone synthesis and StAR mRNA accumula-

tion were found [33]. The supraadditive effect on CYP17 mRNA was not found, implying that the mechanism that takes place for the expression of CYP17 is not completely cAMP-dependent and may be through another pathway, perhaps MAP-kinase dependent or at a step upstream of cAMP production and accumulation. The failure of the exogenous cAMP analogue to fully mimic LHs enhancement of insulin action could alternatively be explained through different cellular reaction activation of endogenous and exogenous cAMP. Additionally, insulin alone was not found to increase cAMP but enhanced LH-driven cAMP accumulation [33]. It is suggested that this could take place via LH-receptor G protein coupling to adenyl cyclase and/or suppression of cAMP degradation [33]. The latter hypothesis was based on insulin’s opposition to the decrease of cAMP accumulation in theca cells over the 48 h time course of LH action. The same effect was also found by Sekar et al. in primary cultures of porcine granulose-luteal cells where insulin or IGF-1 increased LH-stimulated progesterone and cAMP biosynthesis by two fold but did not produce significant alteration when administered on their own [32]. Moreover, insulin and IGF-1 did not have any effect in StAR mRNA accumulation but the combination of LH plus insulin or IGF-1 increased endogenous StAR m-RNA and protein accumulation [32]. Insulin augmentation of cAMP-stimulated increase in StAR mRNA and/or protein levels were also found in human and bovine cells [31,34,35]. Therefore, the interaction of LH and insulin may be mediated in part via signaling interactions between cAMP/PKA and insulin pathways [33]. As far as P450scc is concerned, co-treatment with LH and insulin leads to increased expression of P450scc mRNA when compared with maximal LH-treated granulosa pig cells cultures [31]. Likewise, independently of gonadotrophins, insulin up-regulated P450scc levels in bovine luteal cells [32,34].

Insulin activates both MAP-kinase and PI3-kinase intracellular pathways. Studies carried out by Poretsksy et al. suggested that insulin mediated increase in steroidogenesis is independent of the activation of the PI3 K pathway. They demonstrated the failure of a specific irreversible inhibitor of PI-3 kinase to abolish the stimulatory effect of insulin on progesterone production in cultures of human granulosa cells [36].

The inhibition of MAPK activity was also not capable to interfere in insulin-induced stimulation of progesterone. In contrast to insulin, IGF-I-induced stimulation of progesterone production was affected by the inhibition of MAPK activity. The fact that the activation of this pathway is also not required for the ovarian specific effects of insulin strongly supports the hypothesis that alternative pathways of insulin action are implicated in these effects [37].

In theca cells, in order to investigate the potential mechanism via which insulin regulates 17α-hydroxylase activation, Munir et al. used insulin and forskolin in human ovarian theca cells and found an increase in basal 17α-hydroxylase activity and CYP17 mRNA expression. Insulin alone did not produce the same effect and required forskolin to enhance insulin’s action (forskolin increased 17α-hydroxylase activity which was further increased by insulin) [38]. Using antibodies against the insulin receptor, 17α-hydroxylase activity was not modulated when forskolin and insulin where added, confirming a direct effect of insulin via its own receptor and not via the IGF-1 receptor [38]. In the presence of specific MEK inhibitor and concomitant stimulation by insulin plus forskolin, 17α-hydroxylase activity did not decrease as opposed to the complete block of the insulin-stimulated 17α-hydroxylase activity by PI3-kinase inhibitor. These data point out that insulin action in theca cells on 17α-hydroxylase activity is exerted via the PI3-kinase pathway and not via the MAP-kinase pathway. Moreover, the inhibition of MAP-kinase pathway revealed a concentration-related increase of insulin-stimulated 17α-hydroxylase activity [38].

Nelson-Degrave et al. studied theca cells from PCOS women in an effort to investigate the molecular mechanisms that implicate MAPK signaling pathway in increased androgen biosynthesis and CYP17 gene expression in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [39]. They found that MEK1/2 phosphorylation state was decreased more than 70%. ERK1/2 phosphorylation state was reduced by 50% in PCOS theca cells in comparison to normal cells and moreover ERK1/2 phosphorylation was found to be decreased in response
to forskolin in normal and PCOS theca cells [39]. It was also shown that activation of ERK1/2 directly inhibits thecal CYP17 mRNA accumulation and androgen biosynthesis. Moreover, in the complete absence of insulin, in PCOS theca cells CYP17 mRNA and DHEA synthesis were increased in PCOS theca cells compared to normal theca cells, demonstrating that in PCOS cells reduced levels of activated MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 are correlated with increased androgen production, via an insulin independent mechanism [39]. Additionally, the inhibition of MEK resulted in an increased CYP17 mRNA and DHEA abundance and the activation of MEK resulted in the opposite effects. The authors concluded that the inactivation of MAPK pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of excessive ovarian androgen production in PCOS [39]. Garzo et al. studied isolated follicular granulosa cells and showed that insulin (500 ng/mL) augmented FSH-induced aromatase activity in these cells [40]. The effect of IGFs and insulin on estradiol production by PCOS granulosa cells was studied by Erickson et al. and the investigators found that IGF-I at 30 ng/mL mimicked the effects of FSH while concomitant treatment with FSH resulted in synergistic increased estradiol production. The same effect was seen with insulin alone or with FSH but only at supraphysiological doses (0.3–10 μg/mL) [41]. On the other hand, Willis et al. used physiological doses of insulin and showed an augmentation of basal production of estradiol and progesterone and of FSH-stimulated progesterone production by granulosa cells of control and PCOS women whereas the response of FSH-stimulated estradiol production was variable (ranging from no effect for granulosa cells in normal women to synergistic for granulosa cells from PCOS women) [42]. Additionally, at submaximal doses of insulin, estrogen and progesterone response were similar in PCOS women and controls, implicating insulin sensitivity in PCOS ovarian granulosa cells despite the well-documented insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in peripheral target tissues of insulin [43]. Also, in physiological concentrations of insulin LH-stimulated steroid accumulation in granulosa cell cultures from both normal and PCOS women were found to be enhanced [31]. Moreover, using antibodies versus IR and IGF-I receptor, insulin-stimulated steroidogenesis in both normal and PCOS human granulosa cells [31] and PCOS theca cells [44] was inhibited by the IR antibodies, whereas IGF-I receptor antibodies had no such effect, providing evidence that insulin acts via its own receptor [45]. Considering that PCOS women are often hyperinsulinemic-subsequent to insulin resistance-granulosa cells should be prone to increased steroidogenesis. However, PCOS follicle maturation is often defected and Franks et al. suggested that this could be explicated based on the hypothesis that “while insulin enhances steroidogenesis it may, by virtue of its interaction with LH, bring about inappropriate advancement of granulosa cell differentiation and, hence, arrest of follicle growth” [46].

The insulin activity in granulosa cells from women with PCOS presents resistance in glycogen synthesis which was improved after troglitazone addition in these cultures. However, in the same experiment IGF-I demonstrated an activation of the mitogenic pathway, associated with an increase in mitogenic activity [47]. The abnormal glucose metabolism is also supported by a recent study in which insulin-stimulated lactate production by granulosa-lutein cells from women with anovulatory PCO was significantly impaired compared with the response in cells obtained from women with either normal ovaries or from ovulatory women with polycystic ovaries [48]. The recent data provide evidence suggesting impairment of metabolic pathways in granulosa cells in women with PCOS, possibly due to defective insulin action.

PCOS is correlated with well described molecular defects of insulin’s signaling pathways at the post-receptor level in target tissues (muscle and adipocytes) as well as in the ovarian tissue. The metabolic pathway of insulin activity is defective, while the activation of steroidogenic pathways are maintained. Further research

is necessary in order to clarify the downstream defects of insulin signaling in peripheral and ovarian tissue.
