**Progesterone signalling in breast cancer: a neglected hormone coming into the limelight**

**Cathrin Brisken**

Abstract | Understanding the biology of the breast and how ovarian hormones impinge on it is key to rational new approaches in breast cancer prevention and therapy. Because of the success of selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as tamoxifen, and aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer treatment, oestrogens have long received the most attention. Early progesterone receptor (PR) antagonists, however, were dismissed because of severe side effects, but awareness is now increasing that progesterone is an important hormone in breast cancer. Oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) signalling and PR signalling have distinct roles in normal mammary gland biology in mice; both ERα and PR delegate many of their biological functions to distinct paracrine mediators. If the findings in the mouse model translate to humans, new preventive and therapeutic perspectives might open up.

**17β-oestradiol**  
The predominant form of oestrogen in the human body it is more abundant than oestrone and oestriol both in terms of serum levels and oestrogenic activity.

Breast cancer is increasingly being appreciated to be a complex disease. Pathologists have characterized 18 distinct histopathological subtypes¹ and comprehensive molecular profiling has revealed four major classes of breast cancer²; particularly clinically relevant factors in this disease are tumour grade, hormone receptor status and the presence of ERBB2 (also known as HER2) amplification.

Evidence for enormous heterogeneity at the molecular level continues to accumulate, with exon and whole-genome sequencing of several hundred breast carcinomas revealing the presence of, on average, 300 mutations in the coding sequence per tumour but only a few genes that are frequently mutated across many tumours²³. This raises complex questions about driver versus passenger mutations, tumour cell heterogeneity⁴ and tumour evolution⁵.

The widely held view that mutations in breast epithelial cells drive mammary carcinogenesis, however, is questioned by observations of the Danish pathologist Maja Nielsen⁶. She sectioned entire breasts of women who had died of causes other than cancer and revealed that 30% of women in their forties had ductal carcinoma *in situ* (DCIS) or closely related precursor lesions⁶. The number of women who are actually diagnosed with breast cancer is substantially lower — one in eight (that is, 12.5%) — indicating that only a subset of precursor lesions will progress to clinically relevant disease.

This is remarkable as DCIS is considered to be a direct precursor of invasive breast cancer, and comparative genomic hybridization has revealed the presence of extensive genetic alterations in DCIS that are similar to those found in nearby invasive lesions⁷. Thus, the presence of numerous mutations in breast epithelial cells, and even of a highly rearranged genome, is not sufficient to drive breast carcinogenesis. Additional factors must determine whether genetically altered cells progress to the state at which they provoke clinically manifest disease.

Experiments in mice and rats have shown that the ovarian steroid hormones, 17β-oestradiol and progesterone, are pivotal in the control of breast development and physiology⁸⁹, and both experimental and epidemiological studies indicate that the two hormones are intimately linked to mammary carcinogenesis. Hence, the dissection of their respective roles and understanding their mechanism of action could lead to the development of novel rational approaches for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. The mouse mammary gland is a versatile experimental system that has been used to address these issues, in particular the complexities of endocrine versus paracrine signalling. The rat model, which is generally considered closer to that of the human breast, continues to have an important role in carcinogenesis studies (BOX 1).

Reproductive hormones and breast cancer

**Reproductive physiology.** Centuries ago, breast cancer was considered to be a disease of nuns, a population that generally has a healthy lifestyle but uncommon reproductive behaviour. Epidemiological studies revealed that early full-term pregnancies lowered the risk of developing breast cancer<sup>10</sup>. More recently, this was shown to be specific to progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast cancers<sup>11</sup>, which represent the majority of breast cancers. For all types of breast cancer, risk increases with early menarche (the establishment of menstrual cycles), late menopause and shorter menstrual cycles<sup>11</sup>; these factors all increase the number of menstrual cycles a woman experiences during her lifetime and hence the exposure time of the mammary epithelium to ovarian hormones.

The effect of menstrual cycles on breast cancer progression is strikingly illustrated by comparing the age-specific incidence of colon cancer with that of breast cancer. The incidence of both cancers increases exponentially up to the age of 50 — the average age at menopause — after which the increase continues unabated for colon cancer but slows for breast cancer. It has been estimated that six times as many women would succumb to breast cancer if there were no menopause<sup>12</sup>.

The hypothalamic–pituitary axis triggers changes in ovarian hormone levels during every menstrual cycle, with a pre-ovulatory, follicular phase characterized by an oestrogen peak, followed by a post-ovulatory, luteal phase, during which the body prepares for a potential pregnancy; the luteal phase is characterized by a smaller oestrogen peak and by high levels of progesterone (FIG. 1). If pregnancy occurs progesterone levels rise further; because of its high levels and prominent role throughout pregnancy, progesterone has been dubbed the ‘pregnancy hormone’.

Several lines of evidence suggest that repeated exposure to luteal phase, and hence to increased serum progesterone levels, increases breast cancer risk. First, the breast is quiescent during the first part of the menstrual cycle, the follicular phase. A lot of confusion arises from calling the first part of the cycle the ‘proliferative phase’. This term, however, is based on the changes that occur in the uterus: the endometrium proliferates before ovulation. Post-ovulatory secretion of progesterone has anti-proliferative effects on the endometrium and induces secretory differentiation in the uterine lining (FIG. 1). In the breast, cell proliferation occurs during the luteal phase, and is accompanied by changes in the stroma<sup>13,14</sup>. Furthermore, this proliferation happens in the terminal ductal lobular units (TDLUs), anatomical structures at the distal ends of the human milk ducts. The finding that all breast cancers originate in the TDLUs, regardless of whether their histopathological label is ‘lobular’, ‘ductal’ or other<sup>15</sup>, suggests that the changes during the luteal phase are related to the origin of breast cancer. Finally, the luteal phase is consistently 14 days long, whereas the duration of the follicular phase varies and is usually in the range of 10 to 21 days. Hence the increased risk of cancer that is related to shorter menstrual cycles correlates with more time spent in luteal phase.

**Hormonal intervention.** More than a century ago, the British surgeon George Beatson described regression of a breast tumour following ovariectomy<sup>16</sup>. In the 1960s, pharmacological antagonists of both oestrogen and progesterone were developed. PR antagonists failed in the clinic because of severe side effects, such as liver toxicity. By contrast, drugs that interfere with oestrogen signalling, such as tamoxifen, which was introduced in the 1970s, and aromatase inhibitors, which were introduced 20 years later, have become mainstays of breast cancer therapy; they substantially prolong survival and have saved many lives<sup>17</sup>.

Agonists for both receptors have been developed and are used for both contraception and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but there are growing concerns that they may increase breast cancer risk. Women currently taking oral contraception are at an increased risk of breast cancer<sup>18</sup>. However, the term oral contraception covers a plethora of approaches, with natural hormones and synthetic agonists in different doses taken according to a multitude of regimens. Most studies do

Box 1 | **The rat model**

In general, the physiology of the rat more closely resembles human physiology than does the mouse. In particular, similarities in liver metabolism make the rat a popular model for preclinical drug discovery and toxicological studies.

The rat has been the mammary tumour model of choice for decades because tumours that mimic the histology of some human breast cancer subtypes can be reproducibly induced by chemical carcinogenesis, and these tumours show hormone dependence<sup>91</sup> and express hormone receptors<sup>92</sup>. Tumours that develop in the mouse mammary gland are mostly oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) negative.

Importantly for mammary gland studies, the rat oestrous cycle is longer and more regular than that of mice, and pre-ovulatory and post-ovulatory phases can be readily distinguished. Furthermore, morphologically, the rat mammary gland bears more resemblance to the human breast than does the mouse mammary gland.

Note that the widely used term 'proliferative phase' is based on the uterine cycle during which the endometrium builds up before ovulation.

but not to the effects of progesterone. The decline in the use of HRT that followed the publication of these results has already caused a decrease in breast cancer incidence²⁷ and, more specifically, the increased risk related to the use of oestrogen plus progestin declined soon after its discontinuation²⁸. An interesting potential explanation is that progestin exposure promotes the progression of pre-existing lesions to invasive cancer, which is in line with Nielsen’s findings⁶. Finally, high mammographical breast density, one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer²⁹,³⁰ was correlated with progestin intake³¹⁻³³.

### Breast and mammary gland development
The mechanisms by which oestrogens and progesterone act *in vivo* are difficult to disentangle because of the complexities of endocrine regulation with multiple interactions at the molecular, cellular, tissue and organismal levels. The breast is the only organ to develop mostly after birth, making it readily amenable to experimental manipulation. In addition, the mouse model provides unique experimental opportunities. Until puberty the mouse mammary gland consists of a rudimentary ductal system that is embedded in fatty stroma linked by a single primary duct to the nipple. At puberty, the milk ducts begin to expand into the mammary fat pad. During adulthood, with repeated oestrous cycles, the ductal system gains in complexity through side branching, which is strongly increased during early pregnancy. The last week of pregnancy is characterized by the sprouting of saccular outpouchings, called alveoli, which are destined to become sites of milk secretion (FIG. 2).

The anatomical structure of the human breast is more complex than the mouse mammary gland, with 10–25 primary ducts emanating from each nipple; these branch extensively and give rise to lobes. At the end of the ducts are the TDLUs, which are bottlebrush-like, branched structures that are surrounded by specialized intralobular stroma. Unlike the homogeneous adipose mammary stroma of the mouse, the human stroma is made of loose connective tissue that is highly vascularized and is separated from the interlobular stroma by fibrous connective tissue.

### Role of progesterone versus oestrogens
Hormone ablation and replacement. Levels of endogenous progesterone and oestrogens can be depleted by ovariectomy, a simple surgical intervention in the mouse. As a result, cell proliferation in the mammary epithelium ceases and the epithelium eventually becomes atrophic. Experiments with such hormone-depleted animals have revealed that the administration of 17β-oestradiol is sufficient to induce cell proliferation in the pubertal gland, ultimately restoring ductal outgrowth, as is seen in intact pubertal animals³⁴. However, when adult mice are ovariectomized and stimulated with 17β-oestradiol, the hormone barely induces any cell proliferation in the mammary gland³⁵, whereas the combination of progesterone with 17β-oestradiol elicits substantial cell proliferation in adult mice that peaks at 48 hours of stimulation³⁶. Little PR expression is detectable in ovariectomized mice³⁷,

not distinguish between these approaches, which could affect breast cancer risk in different ways. Moreover, it is conceivable that more differentiated analyses would identify risk factors, such as a woman’s age or reproductive status, that are specific to particular types of contraception.

Women receiving HRT have little or no increase in breast cancer risk when taking oestrogens only, in fact there may even be a protective effect¹⁹. By contrast, a substantial increase in breast cancer risk was noticed in women taking combinations of an oestrogen and various synthetic progesterone agonists (progestins), despite this being standard of care in the United States and the United Kingdom²⁰⁻²². This could be related to the increase in cell proliferation in the breast epithelium that has been reported with combination therapy²³.

Studies from France revealed that postmenopausal women who took natural progesterone instead of synthetic progestins showed no statistically significant increase in breast cancer risk and that risk depends on the type of progestin used²⁴,²⁵. Progestins have longer half-lives than the unstable progesterone. This suggests that duration, level and molecular details of PR activation are important. Moreover, some progestins can bind to other nuclear receptors, including the androgen and the glucocorticoid receptors²⁶, which further complicates the analysis. Alternatively, there may be special features of the postmenopausal breast that render it particularly susceptible to the effects of progestins

The position of the nipple is indicated by arrowheads. During puberty ducts grow in the mammary fat pad by bifurcating. In adulthood, with repeated oestrous cycles, ductal complexity increases through side branching (arrows in pregnancy day 8.5 panel), which is enhanced during pregnancy. Later during pregnancy, alveologenesis (arrows in pregnancy day 14.5 panel) leads to an extensive increase in functional surface that is required for the secretion of copious amounts of milk during lactation.

and progesterone on its own elicits little proliferation within 48 hours. This is expected because oestrogens are required for PR expression in the mammary epithelium³⁶. At later time points (3, 5 and 10 days) proliferation in response to progesterone stimulation is observed³⁸; however, with longer experimental hormone stimulation, levels of endogenous hormones may change, which could confound the analysis. Despite the caveat that ovariectomy creates nonphysiological conditions, these findings strongly suggest that oestrogens drive pubertal development, whereas progesterone is the major stimulus for cell proliferation in the adult mammary gland.

Genetic approaches. Mice either lacking oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) or both isoforms of PR (BOX 2) have been generated through gene targeting in the germ line. Both mouse strains are viable but the mutant females have complex endocrine abnormalities³⁹,⁴⁰. Tissue recombination experiments with either mutant mammary stroma or epithelium grafted into endocrine-competent animals (FIG. 3) showed that epithelial ERα signalling⁴¹ and epithelial PR⁴² signalling are required at subsequent stages of mammary gland development (reviewed in REF. 43). Indeed, in the absence of epithelial PR signalling in an otherwise PR-intact adult mouse, cell

proliferation in the mammary epithelium is minimal³⁵. Simplistically, it seems from the genetic experiment that ERα signalling, the main driver of pubertal growth, is relegated to a permissive function, as it is required for epithelial PR expression. However, because of the developmental block imposed by the germline deletion, additional functions at later stages could be masked. Resolving this issue awaits studies with lineage-specific conditional ERα deletion.

Mouse versus human. The usefulness of the mouse as a model for human disease is debated because of differences in the physiology and organ morphology between the two species. With regards to the hormonal regulation of the mammary gland, the findings in the mouse mentioned above are reminiscent of what can be observed in humans. The breast epithelium is quiescent during the follicular phase when serum oestrogen levels peak. Cell proliferation is observed during the luteal phase when high serum progesterone levels prevail. In fact, hormonal secretion follows a similar pattern in the two species, with a progesterone peak after ovulation⁴⁴. However, the oestrous cycles of mice are not regular and are poorly delineated⁴⁵.

The sequential requirement for the two hormones during development seems to be conserved: thelarche, the onset of breast growth in girls, is associated with

increasing ovarian oestrogen secretion and precedes menarche, which reflects the onset of cyclic progesterone secretion. Mice and humans differ substantially in the details of their hormonal physiology; they have different hormone levels, different hormone processing by liver enzymes; different metabolites; and different regulation of aromatase, the enzyme that converts circulating androgens to oestrogens locally in the breast⁴⁶.

Global gene expression profiling of the response to oestrogens and progesterone in mouse and human model systems has shown poor overlap and led to the suggestion that there are species-specific differences in hormonal regulation and downstream signalling. However, the experimental approaches also differed substantially in that most human work was carried out using cultured cells, whereas the work in mice was generally carried out in the whole organism. We have recently developed an *ex vivo* approach using reduction mammoplasty specimens and shown that in fresh breast tissue microstructures progesterone elicits cell proliferation whereas 17β-oestradiol does so only in a subset of the breast tissue samples⁴⁷. Moreover, important downstream mediators of PR signalling that were identified in the mouse mammary gland but that were not induced in human three-dimensional cultures were also induced in the tissue microstructures that maintain cellular interactions. This suggests that the mouse mammary gland response to hormones is more similar to the human response than previously appreciated.

### Cellular mechanisms of steroid action

#### Cell-intrinsic proliferation versus paracrine proliferation
Across species, ERα and PR are absent from the myoepithelial cells and basal cells and are expressed by 30–50% of the luminal cells⁴⁸,⁴⁹. Most cells co-express ERα and PR, which is consistent with PR being an ERα target. A small subset of cells expresses either only ERα or only PR; whether this means a subset of cells uses a single receptor or whether it merely reflects the expression of these receptors at levels below the detection limit of immunohistochemistry is unclear. To simplify, I refer to cells expressing one or both receptors as hormone receptor-positive (HR⁺) cells throughout.

**Myoepithelial cells and basal cells**

The two terms are often used interchangeably, but strictly speaking myoepithelial cells express markers for α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), caldesmon, p63 and cytokeratin 5 or cytokeratin 6 and other high molecular mass cytokeratins. Basal cells are all the cells that do not touch the lumen hence they include subluminal cells and myoepithelial cells.

**Luminal cells**

Cells that touch the lumen of the mammary ductal system.

**Box 2 | Progesterone receptor isoforms**

Progesterone receptor (PR) is expressed as two isoforms, PRA and PRB. PRB contains an additional 164 amino acids at the amino terminus. The two isoforms are generally expressed at similar levels in the breast but the ratio can be altered in human breast tumours, with the PRA isoform predominating⁹³. Isoform-specific mouse mutants were generated and revealed that PRB is the functionally important form in the mammary gland, whereas PRA is important for ovarian function⁹⁴. In reporter assays the two forms have distinct but overlapping transcriptional activities⁹⁵. They have also been reported to be differentially expressed during mammary gland development⁹⁶.

Studies in which freshly isolated, healthy human breast tissue samples were labelled with radioactive thymidine to mark proliferating cells revealed that most of the breast epithelial cells that incorporated the marked nucleotides were ERα- and PR-negative cells⁴⁸. This dissociation of proliferation and HR expression was subsequently demonstrated *in vivo*, both in mice and in rats⁵⁰,⁵¹, and this led to the suggestion that HR⁺ cells function as organizers that may instruct their neighbours. The low propensity of HR⁺ cells to proliferate has been linked to the presence in the subjacent extracellular matrix (ECM) of processed transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) that activates TGFβ receptor (TGFβR) signalling, leading to the accumulation of phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 in the nucleus⁵².

Genetic evidence from mouse models indicates that steroid hormones can indeed act by paracrine mechanisms; either *Esr1⁻/⁻* (which encodes ERα) or *Pgr⁻/⁻* (which encodes PR) mammary epithelial cells derived from the respective mutant animals, were mixed with wild-type cells to generate chimeric epithelia in cleared mammary fat pads. Receptor-deficient cells injected together with wild-type cells were able to contribute extensively to all aspects of mammary gland development. By contrast, receptor-deficient cells injected on their own could not⁴¹,⁴². Interestingly, when intact pieces of epithelial tissue from *Pgr⁻/⁻* or wild-type animals were co-transplanted into the same fat pad, no rescue occurred, indicating that the *Pgr⁻/⁻* mammary epithelial cells need to be in close proximity to wild-type cells for rescue to occur⁴². Hence, the factors implicated are not widely diffusible but function in a paracrine manner. This makes secreted factors such as WNTs, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) family members attractive candidates but is also compatible with direct intercellular signalling mediated by Notch, ephrins or gap junctions.

Amphiregulin is an essential paracrine mediator of the cell proliferation induced by ERα at puberty⁵³ and has also been linked to PR signalling in the rat mammary gland⁵⁴; WNT4 and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL; also known as TNFSF11) have been established as important paracrine mediators of PR signalling⁵⁵,⁵⁶. Many other proteins have been implicated in mammary gland development by genetic experiments⁴³ but how they connect to hormonal control mechanisms remains to be established in most cases.

#### Sensors and responders
Thus, the HR⁺ cells seem to act as ‘sensor’ cells that translate the signals encoded by systemic hormones into local paracrine signals. To relay these signals they secrete paracrine factors that bind to receptors on HR⁻, luminal and basal cells, which act as the ‘secondary responder cells’. This organizing principle ensures that the signal is amplified and prolonged in time and provides a means of coordinating different biological functions of distinct cell types.

On the basis of elegant experiments in MCF-7 cells that showed rapid degradation of ERα after activation by ligand and by DNA binding⁵⁷ it was thought that HR

gene expression signatures that go well beyond ERα and PR target genes⁶⁰. The HR⁻ cells seem to be destined for milk secretion, as they show increased expression of milk protein genes and of the ETS-related transcription factor ELF5 that has been linked to the formation of secretory alveoli⁶¹. It is, however, conceivable that these expression signatures represent the sum of different subpopulations, HR⁺ or HR⁻, which remain to be characterized.

The idea that HR status also defines different cell types in humans is supported by global gene expression profiling of breast tumours⁶². The major molecular subtypes are thought to reflect the stage in the mammary lineage from which the tumour was derived: a clinically rare stem cell-like type called claudin-low⁶³; an ER⁻ type resembling luminal progenitors called basal-like; and two differentiated types, an ER⁻ type called molecular apocrine⁶⁴, and finally the most common of breast tumours, an ER⁺ type called luminal. ERBB2-positive tumours are equally distributed between the two differentiated types. As the basal-like tumours are negative for steroid receptors (ER and PR) and ERBB2, they are commonly called triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

### Progesterone-induced changes

Given that recurrent menstrual cycles and repeated progesterone exposure increase breast cancer risk, it is important to understand which pathways progesterone activates as it impinges on the adult mammary gland through the HR⁺ cells. The mechanisms by which progesterone triggers cell proliferation, activates progenitor cells, induces branching morphogenesis, affects immune cells, and controls the vasculature to ensure increased blood flow during the luteal phase and pregnancy are beginning to emerge in the mouse model (FIG. 4). I concentrate on the role of progesterone in cells in the HR⁺ cells — the sensor cells — in which ERα signalling is also active. Changes in oestrogen levels during the oestrous cycle impinge on all PR signalling activities and may be doing the fine-tuning (FIG. 4).

In contrast to tissues such as the skin or the intestine where epithelial cells proliferate, differentiate and then shed, in the mammary gland, newly generated cells in the milk ducts are not automatically shed as part of the process of maturation. Increases in cell number are required for side branches to form in the mouse mammary gland and for TDLUs to increase in complexity in the human breast. There is some cell death at the end of each menstrual cycle, and massive apoptosis leading to the loss of alveolar structures after weaning (FIG. 2).

### Cell proliferation

Stimulation of ovariectomized female mice with progesterone (after an oestrogen pretreatment that is required to induce PR expression) elicits a first, small wave of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in PR⁺ cells, which is consistent with a cell-intrinsic mechanism (FIG. 5a). This is followed by a large wave of cell proliferation in PR⁻ cells³⁵ in line with the extra time required for synthesis and secretion

**Figure 4 | Model: effect of menstrual cycles on breast cancer risk based on work in mouse models.** Breast cancer risk is plotted over time, representative of a year during a woman’s reproductive age. Every hormonal cycle there is some increase in breast cancer risk when progesterone serum levels increase during the luteal phase as shown for a representative cycle (dashed box). Oestrogens induce the expression of the progesterone receptor (PR) and may have other functions that remain to be discerned, these probably involve fine-tuning of progesterone action at the level of transcriptional modulation. Several downstream mediators receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL), cyclin D1, WNT4, calcitonin and inhibitor of DNA binding 4 (ID4) have been identified in the mouse. Genetic evidence has been provided that RANKL is required for progesterone-induced proliferation of hormone receptor (HR)⁻ cells and cyclin D1 is required for cell proliferation of HR⁺ cells (bold grey arrows). RANKL has been implicated in the regulation of bipotential stem cells⁷⁵,⁷⁶ and shown to be required for side branching³⁵. In Wnt4⁻/⁻ and Id4⁻/⁻ (REF. 82) mammary epithelia side branching is delayed. The role of calcitonin awaits further studies. Arrows in black indicate interactions that have been validated in humans⁴³. ECM, extracellular matrix.

of a paracrine factor, and with the signal amplification resulting from diffusion of this factor to multiple surrounding cells (FIG. 5b).

Cyclin D1 (encoded by CCND1) amplification and overexpression occur specifically in ER⁺ breast cancers⁶⁵ and have been associated with a poor prognosis and endocrine resistance⁶⁶–⁶⁸, suggesting a unique role of cyclin D1 in the context of the HR⁺ cancers. To test whether cyclin D1 is particularly important in HR⁺ cells, mice with contralateral cleared fat pads were reconstituted with Ccnd1⁻/⁻ versus wild-type epithelium, hormonally ablated and stimulated with progesterone³⁵. The two types of proliferation, cell-intrinsic and paracrine proliferation, were observed in the wild-type graft but in the Ccnd1⁻/⁻ epithelium proliferation of HR⁺ cells was specifically impaired. Thus, the cell-intrinsic action of progesterone on HR⁺ cell proliferation requires cyclin D1 (FIG. 5a), whereas the proliferation of HR⁻ cells does not (FIG. 5b). Whether this relates to the cell cycle function of cyclin D1, be it catalytic or through the sequestration of p21 and p27, or the interactions of cyclin D1 with hormone receptors and their co-regulators (reviewed in REF. 69) remains to be elucidated.

Proliferation of HR⁻ cells on progesterone stimulation requires RANKL (FIG. 5b), a tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) family member that was first isolated as being important for dendritic cells, which was shown to be important for osteoclast function⁷⁰. Subsequently, RANKL was implicated in mammary gland development⁵⁵. Its abrogation in the mammary epithelium of mice resulted in a lactation defect, which was linked to prolactin receptor signalling via inhibitor of NF-κB kinase-α (IKKα)⁷¹. However, RANKL expression is strongly induced by PR signalling and required for PR-induced side branching⁷²,⁷³. The protein is expressed specifically in PR⁺ luminal cells⁷³.

Progesterone elicits proliferation of HR+ cells by a cell-intrinsic, cyclin D1-dependent mechanism (part a). The hormone also induces the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) secretion, which triggers the proliferation of adjacent HR− cells (part b).

have luminal characteristics and fail to reconstitute ductal trees in cleared fat pads. Instead, they give rise to cystic structures<sup>58</sup>. Both oestrogens and progesterone were implicated in mammary stem cell activation on the basis of an increase in the number of integrin α6+ cells after hormone stimulation of ovariectomized mice<sup>75,76</sup>. RANKL was implicated in this hormone-induced stem cell expansion on the basis of the decreased *in vitro* clonogenic capacity of integrin β1+ CD24+ cells harvested from mammary glands after *in vivo* treatment with an antibody against RANKL<sup>76</sup>. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the RANKL receptor RANK abrogated a two-fold increase in the integrin α6+ compartment induced by progestin treatment<sup>77</sup>, suggesting that RANKL may activate the stem cells as a paracrine factor.

Conversely, recent lineage-tracing experiments have provided evidence that the totipotent stem cell function may be provoked by the particular experimental conditions and may not be relevant to normal physiological homeostasis. Indeed, luminally and myoepithelially restricted progenitors are sufficient to maintain the postnatal gland<sup>78,79</sup>. This raises the question of whether RANKL or the other paracrine factors such as WNT4 and amphiregulin may function selectively on one or the other types of lineage-restricted progenitors.

Other biological functions and factors. Along with cell proliferation and the expansion of the progenitor cells, other biological processes are required to prepare the gland for copious milk production after the birth of pups in the mouse model. A large amount of ECM needs to be restructured in the process, and angiogenesis is required to feed new ducts and to subsequently bring in the nutrients that are necessary for milk production. Different types of immune cells help to build most of the transient structures required for lactation, and subsequently help to destroy them and clear away the cellular debris. Various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the associated tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) have been implicated<sup>80</sup> but how they are linked to hormonal pathways remains to be elucidated. A complex interplay between multiple cell types is to be expected. Powerful *in vivo* imaging approaches have shown us some of the activities of macrophages in the mammary gland<sup>81</sup> and promise to provide novel insights in the future.

Genetic evidence has been provided that WNT4 is an important mediator of PR signalling. In the absence of WNT4 from the mammary epithelium, side branching is delayed. Ectopic expression of its cousin WNT1 can rescue side branching by a paracrine mechanism in the absence of PR signalling<sup>56</sup>. Similarly, inhibitor of DNA binding 4 (ID4), a basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) protein that is predominantly expressed in the myoepithelium is induced by progesterone, and its deletion in the mammary epithelium blocks side branching<sup>82</sup>. Calcitonin and amphiregulin have also been identified as *in vivo* progesterone targets<sup>83</sup>. Deletion of amphiregulin revealed a role for oestrogen-induced proliferation during pubertal ductal elongation<sup>53</sup>. This early phenotype

double-transgenic approach, resulted in side branching and alveologenesis<sup>74</sup>. Similarly, ectopic RANKL expression in *Pgr−/−* mammary epithelium by means of a retroviral approach, rescued the *Pgr−/−* phenotype, indicating that RANKL is a crucial mediator of PR signalling function. Immunohistochemistry shows RANKL is present at the cell membrane, but whether it impinges on the neighbouring cells in this membrane-bound form or is secreted is unclear. Of clinical relevance, soluble RANKL administered intravenously can elicit proliferation in the mammary epithelium, and systemic administration of its decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG) can inhibit proliferation<sup>35</sup>.

Mammary stem cells. FACS experiments combined with cleared fat pad reconstitution assays revealed that high expression of integrin α6 and integrin β1 enriches for cells with basal characteristics that are able to reconstitute ductal trees in mammary fat pads devoid of endogenous epithelium. This led to the definition of these cells as mammary stem cells. Cells lacking these markers

Figure 6 | Model of breast carcinogenesis. Shown are schematic cross sections of a milk duct with luminal (beige) and outer myoepithelial cells (green) that are surrounded by a basement membrane (pink). Analogously to the Vogelstein model of colon cancer progression<sup>97</sup>, successive stages of breast tumorigenesis are shown. Early stages of breast carcinogenesis are poorly characterized. Hormones impinge on all stages of breast cancer development. In particular, progesterone signalling is important in determining whether pre-existing lesions progress to clinically relevant tumours; that is, invasive and metastatic breast cancer. Progesterone changes the microenvironment, and it activates a number of pathways that have been implicated in the genesis of different subtypes of breast cancer in the mouse mammary gland that control intercellular communication. I hypothesize that repeated activation of these pathways during the luteal phase of menstrual cycles promotes breast carcinogenesis. Some of these such as amphiregulin<sup>98</sup>, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL)<sup>99</sup> and inhibitor of DNA binding 4 (ID4)<sup>100</sup> have indeed been implicated in the genesis of distinct human breast cancer subtypes.

imposes a developmental block that may mask any additional role during side branching. Therefore, defining the exact contributions of these different aspects of progesterone-induced differential gene expression will require further studies. The elucidation of these processes will provide us with important insights into the clinically relevant question of how *in situ* lesions progress to invasive disease.

### Progesterone signalling and breast cancer

What are the implications of these findings for breast cancer? It is conceivable that during repeated menstrual cycles, recurrent activation of PR and its downstream effectors, cyclin D1, WNT4 and RANKL promotes breast carcinogenesis (FIG. 6). Indeed, administration of the PR agonist medroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA) to mice promotes the formation of mammary tumours initiated by DMBA<sup>84</sup>. Such MPA- and DMBA-induced tumorigenesis is slowed both by pharmacologically and by genetically interfering with RANKL signalling<sup>77,85</sup>. Constitutive activation of the well-established signalling pathways downstream of PR is also oncogenic. Ectopic RANK expression in the mammary epithelium driven by the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) promoter increases proliferation in the mammary epithelium<sup>86</sup> and accelerates DMBA- and progestin-induced tumorigenesis<sup>85</sup>.

Another downstream pathway, the WNT signalling pathway, has long been identified as oncogenic in the mouse mammary gland. In fact, the first WNT gene to be cloned was identified as a frequent integration site for MMTV<sup>87</sup>. Its ectopic expression results in extensive ductal hyperplasia and tumours<sup>88</sup>.

Using freshly isolated human breast tissue microstructures we have found that expression of both RANKL and WNT4 mRNA is induced by PR signalling<sup>47</sup>. Moreover, RANKL is sufficient to elicit cell proliferation and is required for progesterone-induced proliferation. The findings in the ex vivo system were validated by the *in vivo* observation that RANKL protein expression correlated with serum progesterone levels in women<sup>47</sup>.

These findings offer exciting perspectives as they suggest that at least some of the pathways are conserved between mice and humans and that they may contribute to tumorigenesis. Hence novel preventive strategies can be envisioned that are based on inhibiting PR and its downstream mediators RANKL and WNT. New-generation selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) that have fewer side effects than earlier ones, have been developed for various gynaecological disorders such as myomas, bleeding endometriosis and other reproductive problems, and may turn out to be useful for patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, an antibody against RANKL, denosumab, is already US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women who are at a high risk of fractures and for the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases. WNT inhibitors are being developed and are undergoing clinical testing<sup>89</sup>.

REVIEW S

Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Compounds (such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) that act on the oestrogen receptor (ER). They can have different effects in different tissues, allowing selective inhibition or stimulation of ER.

Interfering pharmacologically with menstrual cycle-induced activation of the breast (as described above), may be of particular use in young patients with breast cancer. Women under 40 years of age who have breast cancer have a 5% risk of developing a second tumour in the contralateral breast within 10 years. Interfering with the breast-specific effects of increased serum progesterone levels may be an effective way to reduce their risk of dying of breast cancer without blocking all reproductive function. SPRMs could also be envisioned as adjuvant treatment in scenarios in which selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) or aromatase inhibitors are not well tolerated.

With regards to the ability of such drugs to act on established tumours and in advanced disease, important questions need to be addressed. Are the paracrine mechanisms discussed above active in human tumours? It is important to remember that ER+ tumours are defined by immunohistochemistry as having at least 1% of tumour cells that stain for ERα. Hence, they comprise a whole range of tumours with anything from 1% to 100% of the tumour cells expressing ERα. It is conceivable that paracrine signalling is more important for tumours with a low proportion of ERα+ cells than for the majority of ERα+ tumours, which show widespread ERα expression. In ERα+ tumours ERα expression and thymidine incorporation coexist in a large proportion of the cells. Is this proliferation induced by cell-intrinsic and/or by paracrine mechanisms?

Are the paracrine loops active in the metastatic niche? Are they activated by ERα or PR expressed by the tumour cells or perhaps by hormone-responsive bone cells? In the MMTV-ErbB2 tumour model, infiltrating T cells have been shown to stimulate metastasis by releasing RANKL90, suggesting that paracrine loops also involve an immune cell component, at least in tumorigenesis.

HR- tumours generally do not respond to hormone therapy and are thought to bypass the requirement for hormones by constitutively activating cell-intrinsic growth-promoting pathways. The specific growth-promoting pathways chosen may represent a characteristic of a particular tumour or a subset of cells within a given tumour. In their early stages, and possibly in the process of metastatic seeding, there may be hormone-sensitive steps in their progression, as suggested by the finding that menstrual cycles increase the risk for all types of breast cancers.

Blocking the hormone-induced activation of a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment, either in the breast or at distant sites in the body, by interfering with hormone signalling and downstream pathways, may help to prevent disease progression. It could then form the basis of an adjuvant therapy in women diagnosed with early stage disease, many of whom are currently overtreated with chemotherapy.

### Perspectives

Thanks to high-throughput sequencing approaches, our knowledge of the molecular genetics of breast cancer is increasing much faster than our understanding of mammary gland biology and pathology. Reproductive hormones impinge on breast carcinogenesis at all stages and can determine whether the disease will progress (FIG. 6). In particular, PR signalling has a pivotal role in controlling tumour promotion from the *in situ* stage onwards. The insight that systemic hormones use locally produced paracrine factors to mediate their effects offers new opportunities for intervention. Such novel approaches may allow us to ‘deactivate’ a tumour-promoting microenvironment, an approach that may also help to prevent tumour progression and metastasis. How genetic mutations in tumour cells synergize with changes in the microenvironment elicited by hormones will be a challenging area to explore.
