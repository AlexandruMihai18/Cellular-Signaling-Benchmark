unclear whether these proteins are truly metamorphic and can interconvert between the different conformations.

Metamorphic proteins may not be as rare as it currently seems. It may even be, as argued by Tuinstra *et al.* (1), that most structural biology efforts have inadvertently selected against their detection. If so, then we may find more manifestations of this phenomenon as new proteins are studied and old proteins reexamined. Such discoveries will enhance our understanding of protein folding, function, and evolution.

CELL BIOLOGY

# Arrestin' Movement in Cilia

Rajat Rohatgi${}^{1,2}$ and Matthew P. Scott${}^{1}$

Most cells in our bodies bear immotile hairlike protrusions called primary cilia (1). Only a few micrometers long, they are marvelously complex sensors, detecting and interpreting signals from the environment, such as light, odorants, fluid flow, and proteins that signal between cells. In each case, the receptor for the signal, along with some of the proteins that transmit the message into the cell, are localized in cilia. Their movement into and out of cilia controls signaling pathways that ultimately trigger responses such as cell division and differentiation. Thus, a central challenge is to understand how transmembrane proteins, especially receptors, are targeted to primary cilia. In humans, defective trafficking to cilia can cause pathological conditions ranging from cystic kidney disease to brain malformations and obesity (2). On page 1777 of this issue, Kovacs *et al.* (3) describe a new mechanism for the movement of the transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) into primary cilia. Smo is a component of the signaling pathway that responds to secreted proteins in the Hedgehog (Hh) family. The Hh pathway has been previously linked to cilia (4–6) and plays fundamental roles in development, stem cell function, and carcinogenesis (7).

Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted ligand that initiates signaling by binding to its receptor Patched 1 (Ptcl). In the absence of Shh, Ptcl is concentrated in cilia and inhibits Smo activity (8). Shh binding to Ptcl inactivates the receptor and causes Ptcl to move out of cilia.

This allows the activation of Smo, which accumulates within the ciliary membrane (4). The movement of Smo to cilia brings it near other components of the signaling pathway, resulting in activation of transcription factors in the Gli family that regulate gene expression (9). Smo is a seven-pass transmembrane protein that resembles heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors.

Such receptors transmit signals either through trimeric G proteins or through β-arrestin proteins and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (Grks) (10). The roles of β-arrestins are quite broad. Recruited to receptors by ligand binding and Grk phosphorylation, they can desensitize receptors to further stimulation and assemble protein complexes that have trafficking and signaling functions (10). The

**Opposing control of signaling by a motor complex.** The primary cilium is depicted as a compartment where activator (GliA) and repressor (GliR) forms of the Gli transcription factor are produced. (Left) In the absence of Shh, Kif3A forms a repressive complex that promotes production of GliR. (Right) In the presence of Shh, Grk2 induces the association of Smo and β-arrestin, which together move into primary cilia. Smo-β-arrestin recruits the motor protein Kif3A to an activator complex that promotes GliA formation. In this model, the distribution of Kif3A between these two complexes determines the ratio of GliA to GliR.

depletion of Grk2 and β-arrestin 2 in cultured mammalian cells and zebrafish embryos blocks Hh signaling (11–13). Smo activation leads to the Grk2-mediated association of β-arrestin 2 with Smo, which then triggers the internalization (endocytosis) of Smo (12).

Kovacs *et al.* investigate the next important question: How does recruitment of β-arrestin 2 to Smo activate signaling? Using RNA interference in cultured mouse fibroblasts, the authors show that depletion of β-arrestin 1 or 2 prevents the movement of Smo to cilia as well as subsequent target gene transcription. The authors propose that Smo trafficking to cilia is mediated by Shh-enhanced association of the Smo–β-arrestin complex with the type II kinesin motor Kif3A. The finding that β-arrestin is required for both endocytosis and ciliary targeting of Smo seems contradictory; however, vesicles that carry Smo to the cilia may originate from the plasma membrane as recycling endosomes rather than directly from an intracellular source (the Golgi).

Kif3A, a component of the kinesin II motor complex, transports protein cargos within cilia. Materials are conveyed along microtubules at the core of the cilium by an elaborate intraflagellar transport system (1). This system is composed of a Kif3A-driven motor complex that moves toward the tip of the cilium and a second complex driven by the motor protein dynein that moves back toward the base. The link between cilia and Hh signaling emerged from the observation that mouse embryos lacking intraflagellar transport components, including Kif3A, have damaged Hh signaling (5).

Mice carrying mutations in the genes encoding Kif3A and other intraflagellar transport proteins suffer from developmental abnormalities caused by a lack of both Gli activator function (such as neural tube defects) and Gli repressor function (such as limb defects) (6). Does the discovery of a Smo–β-arrestin–Kif3A complex shed light on these complex phenotypes? The role of Kif3A in activating Gli proteins is consistent with its role in promoting Smo movement to cilia. However, Kif3A has a second role in Hh signaling that is probably independent of Smo. In the absence of Shh, Kif3A promotes conversion of Gli3 into a truncated repressor form, Gli3R (6). Thus, Kif3A represses target genes by promoting Gli3R formation in the absence of Shh, but promotes Gli activator formation by transporting Smo into cilia in the presence of Shh (see the figure). The switch between these two states may be triggered by the formation of the Smo–β-arrestin–Kif3A complex. This is reminiscent of the dual role played by the motor protein Costal2 in Hh signaling in the fly *Drosophila melanogaster* (7).

Several seven-transmembrane receptors, such as those for somatostatin and serotonin, are located in primary cilia, so an important question is whether these receptors also rely on a β-arrestin–Kif3A complex for their localization. In mammalian photoreceptor cells, Kif3A transports arrestin and the seven-transmembrane receptor opsin through a specialized variant of primary cilia (14). Because many seven-transmembrane receptors associate with β-arrestin, but only a small number localize in cilia, additional factors must control ciliary localization. The Bardet-Biedl syndrome protein complex controls trafficking of seven-transmembrane receptors to cilia (15, 16). Unraveling how these and other mechanisms together regulate movement of transmembrane proteins to cilia will continue to shed light on Hh and other signaling pathways in primary cilia, illuminating new aspects of cell biology and potentially new paths to disease therapies.

**Himalaya—Carbon Sink or Source?**

Jerome Gaillardet${}^{1}$ and Albert Galy${}^{2}$

**Chemical analysis of hot springs in the Himalaya suggest that the carbon released from mountain forming regions may warm Earth.**

In 1845, the French mining engineer Joseph Ebelmen described how atmospheric CO₂ reacts with rock minerals to form dissolved salts and bicarbonate. He envisioned the possibility of a global carbon cycle, in which the CO₂ injected into the atmosphere by volcanoes is first transformed into soluble bicarbonate and then participates in the precipitation of carbonates in the ocean.

Today, the global carbon cycle and its influence on the long-term (million to billion years) evolution of climate are still a matter of research. The theory of plate tectonics gave a better framework for the concept of sediment recycling (1). The role of silicate weathering as a climate regulator has been strengthened by modeling of the carbon cycle (2, 3), a better understanding of the interrelationships with other biogeochemical cycles, and the accumulated data from the geological archive. In addition to this, previously unconsidered CO₂ inputs to
