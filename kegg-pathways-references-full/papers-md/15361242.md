Summary: The intracellular protozoan *Toxoplasma gondii* exerts profound
effects on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)- and mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK)-signaling cascades in macrophages. During early infec-
tion, nuclear translocation of NF-κB is blocked, and later, the cells display
defects in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced MAPK phosphorylation after
undergoing initial activation in response to *Toxoplasma* itself. Infected
macrophages that are subjected to triggering through Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4) with LPS display defective production of tumor necrosis factor-α
and IL-12 (IL-12) that likely reflects interference with NF-κB-
and MAPK-signaling cascades. Nevertheless, *T. gondii* possesses molecules that
themselves induce eventual proinflammatory cytokine synthesis. For
interleukin-12, this occurs through both myeloid differentiation factor
88-dependent and chemokine receptor CCR5-dependent pathways.
The balance between activation and interference with proinflammatory
signaling is likely to reflect the need to achieve an appropriate level of
immunity that allows the host and parasite to maintain a stable interaction.

Introduction

To achieve a successful host–parasite interaction during micro-
bial infection, it requires a complex set of closely coordinated
responses from host and pathogen. Failure to successfully
synchronize these responses has negative consequences for both.
A balanced interaction between the parasite and its host can
result in life-long asymptomatic infection. Death may be the
consequence of a dysfunctional relationship between the two.
Molecular communication between the host innate immune
system and the intracellular protozoan *Toxoplasma gondii* is fast
emerging as a dramatic example of these key principles in
action.

*T. gondii* is an intracellular coccidian belonging to the phylum
Apicomplexa. In addition to *Toxoplasma*, this phylum contains
the important human pathogens *Plasmodium* and *Cryptosporidium*.
*Toxoplasma* itself is distinguished by an extremely broad host
range as well as the normally benign course of infection. The

parasite can infect virtually all warm-blooded animals and is prevalent in all regions of the world. In humans, the infection rate is estimated at 10–30%, although in some regions, the prevalence may reach 80%. The normally innocuous nature of infection and the global pervasiveness of T. gondii are together powerful testimony to the extraordinary success of this parasitic microorganism.

Notwithstanding the asymptomatic nature of T. gondii infection in most hosts, the high incidence of the parasite in humans and animals nevertheless makes Toxoplasma a serious threat to human health. Indeed, in humans, this parasite is the third most common cause of mortality due to food-borne infections and has been estimated confer an economic/public health burden of more than US$400 million annually in the United States (1, 2). Clinical toxoplasmosis most commonly manifests in two forms: congenital infection and toxoplasmic encephalitis due to immune system dysfunction. Parasite transmission to the fetus most often occurs during primary maternal infection, and its estimated incidence is 1 in 1000 births in North America. Infection of the fetus may cause death or debilitating disease (3). Infected infants most often show signs of hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and intracranial calcification. Sequelae of infection may also emerge later in life, manifesting as mental retardation, convulsions, and impaired vision (3). In immunocompromised populations, reactivation of latent infection can cause sizable focal lesions in the central nervous system. This occurrence is most likely a direct result of tissue destruction caused by uncontrolled replication of newly emerged tachyzoites. Approximately, 25% of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with underlying T. gondii infection undergo reactivating toxoplasmosis (4–6). Although anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) therapy is now highly effective at halting AIDS progression in the Western world, the specter of drug-resistant HIV strains raises the sobering possibility that opportunistic infections typified by Toxoplasma may re-emerge (7). More immediately, toxoplasmosis remains a serious threat in underdeveloped countries that do not have resources to provide anti-HIV drug therapy.

Infection with T. gondii begins with ingestion of cyst-containing bradyzoites in contaminated meat or by accidental ingestion of sporozoites contained within oocysts shed by cats (8). Excystation occurs in the small intestine, resulting in differentiation to tachyzoites. The latter cross the gut epithelium, enter the body of the host, and rapidly disseminate. Acute infection peaks at approximately 7–10 days, coinciding with emergence of a strong T-cell response that is characterized by high-level CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T lymphocyte interferon-γ (IFN-γ)

secretion (9–11). This response acts to restrict Toxoplasma replication and spread, and at the same general time, the parasite begins to revert to the slow-growing bradyzoite form that is associated with cyst formation in skeletal muscle and central nervous system tissue. Insofar as cysts induce little or no signs of inflammation, the parasite appears remarkably quiescent in this state. Nevertheless, the necessity for an ongoing T-cell-mediated response during chronic infection has been demonstrated in experimental mouse models (12, 13) and most dramatically in the case of toxoplasmic encephalitis associated with immune dysfunction (4, 14).

Toxoplasma tachyzoites, the proliferative parasite form associated with acute infection, are capable of infecting virtually all types of nucleated cells (15). Invasion itself is a process requiring parasite actin-myosin-based motility to actively penetrate the host cell (16). As the parasite enters the cell, it drags along with it host membrane, creating a specialized parasitophorous vacuole that resists acidification and phagolysosomal maturation (17, 18). The parasitophorous vacuole shuttles from the host cell membrane to a juxtanuclear position, where it becomes ornamented with host mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (19). During invasion and formation of the parasitophorous vacuole, micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules sequentially discharge in a regulated fashion (20). These are secretory organelles believed to be important in invasion and generation of the parasitophorous vacuole. Microneme proteins such as the MIC2-M2AP-adhesive protein complex are required for rapid invasion (21, 22). Rhoptry contents are discharged into the local cytoplasm during cell penetration, and they may function in biogenesis of the parasitophorous vacuole (23). In addition, the ROP2 rhoptry protein inserts into the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and mediates anchoring of host mitochondria (24). Once invasion is completed, dense granule contents are discharged into the parasitophorous vacuole lumen, and these are generally believed to function in nutrient acquisition from the host cell through association with the tubulovesicular network of the parasitophorous vacuole (25). Within this cellular context, Toxoplasma encounters the host immune system.

Role of the immune system at the host-pathogen interface

Toxoplasma is a master manipulator of immunity. On one hand, the parasite must allow itself to be sensed by the immune system, so that protective immune responses necessary for long-term host and parasite survival are allowed to develop. This requirement manifests as strong type-1 cytokine

responses, brought about by early interleukin-12 (IL-12) production that plays a role, along with cofactors such as tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$), IL-18, IL-1$\beta$, and CD28, in inducing early natural killer (NK)-cell IFN-$\gamma$ production (26–31). IL-12 is also pivotal in T-helper 1 cell (Th1) response ignition, and it is therefore responsible for the protective acquired immune response, largely dependent upon IFN-$\gamma$-producing CD4${}^{+}$ and CD8${}^{+}$ T lymphocytes, that is ultimately necessary for long-term survival and protection against re-infection (9–12, 32, 33) (Fig. 1).

On the other hand, Toxoplasma must avoid inducing overly robust immunity, because this would lead to parasite elimination. From this perspective, *T. gondii* must engage in evasion of the immune response. Formation of cysts in brain and skeletal muscle tissue in the absence of an overt inflammatory response provides a likely example of this concept in action (15).

The high rate of infection in human and animal populations worldwide, and the generally low incidence of clinical toxoplasmosis in all but the immunocompromised (6, 34), are indications of the skill with which the parasite achieves the balance between triggering and suppressing (or avoiding) the host immune response.

The encounter between Toxoplasma and cells of the innate immune system occurs within a dynamic arena wherein the principles of microbial-induced immune activation and subversion are dramatically played out. Macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils are major effectors of innate immunity and as such are important players at the host-pathogen interface (35–39) (Fig. 1). Infection is controlled through production of mediators such as nitric oxide and the IFN-$\gamma$-inducible guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins IGTP and LRG-47 (40–44). These phagocytes are sources of immunoregulatory cytokines, most prominently IL-12, and (for the case of dendritic cells and macrophages) function as professional antigen-presenting cells (35, 39, 45–50). Therefore, it is clear that such cell types can serve the dual function of acting as microbicidal effectors and instructing development of acquired immunity.

While Toxoplasma can trigger signaling cascades leading to IL-12 and TNF-$\alpha$ production by in vitro cultures of innate immune cells, the in vivo source of these cytokines is not entirely clear. Thus, the cytokines could be produced: (i) as a direct result of infection, (ii) as a result of phagocytic uptake of dead parasites, (iii) as a consequence of uptake of secreted parasite antigens, or (iv) as a result of triggering by endogenous danger signals that may accompany the cell lytic effects of infection (51, 52).

Expert investigations by immunologists have revealed the complexity with which the host immune system responds to Toxoplasma infection. Likewise, elegant work by cell biologists over the last decade has given us a picture of the intracellular niche occupied by *T. gondii*. Nevertheless, still poorly understood are cellular and molecular interactions that occur between infected host immune cells and the parasite itself. Although the parasite resides within its own intracellular vacuole, it is becoming clear Toxoplasma influences its fate by manipulating molecular-signaling pathways within the host cell. Central to proinflammatory signal transduction in the innate immune system are the nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B)-and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling cascades. For macrophages, proinflammatory-signaling cascades are targeted for manipulation by Toxoplasma. Here, the principles of immune activation and immune subversion are dramatically played out within infected cells. In other innate immune cells, recent work is elucidating how

Fig. 1. Major components in the immune response to *Toxoplasma gondii*. Encounter between parasites themselves, soluble parasite-derived molecules, or possibly host factors released as a result of infection triggers early proinflammatory cytokine production by dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages (M$\phi$), and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Together, tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) stimulate production of protective interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$) from natural killer (NK) cells, thereby promoting early survival. Development of CD4${}^{+}$ Th1 cells and CD8${}^{+}$ T lymphocytes under the influence of IL-12 results in high-level IFN-$\gamma$ production that allows long-term host survival and progression to stable chronic stage infection. IFN-$\gamma$ exerts its effects through induction of microbicidal nitric oxide and IGTP-related proteins, whose functions are still unclear. Macrophages activated by IFN-$\gamma$ may also act as microbicidal effectors against Toxoplasma through less well-defined functions, including increased phagocytic activity and release of reactive oxygen intermediates.

Toxoplasma triggers pathways leading to proinflammatory mediator production.

Overview of the Rel/NF-κB- and MAPK-signaling pathways

The NF-κB and MAPK transduction cascades are evolutionarily ancient signaling pathways that take part in many physiological processes, including a prominent role in defense against infection. In the immune system, activation can be directly mediated through cytokine receptors, such as TNFRI and IL-1R, as well as through microbial pattern recognition receptors, most prominently the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family that functions as detectors of infection (53). These cascades culminate in the induction of multiple proinflammatory genes that are important in defense against microbial infection, including IL-12(p40), TNF-α, IL-6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).

- TLR-initiated NF-κB- and MAPK-signaling pathways are shown in Fig. 2. The TLR family recognizes an increasingly diverse spectrum of microbial ligands, resulting in recruitment of the adapter molecule myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), which in turn leads to association with IL-1 receptor-associated kinases-1 (IRAK-1) and IRAK-4 (54, 55). Activation of the IRAK molecules results in recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF-6), leading to dissociation of the IRAK-1/IRAK-4/TRAF-6 from the receptor complex (56). IRAK-1/IRAK-4/TRAF-6 interacts at the membrane with another complex consisting of MAP3K transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and adapter molecules TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) and TAB2. The complex TRAF-6/TAK1/TAB1/TAB2 translocates to the cytoplasm and activated TAK1 functions as the initiator of both NF-κB and MAPK pathways (57–60). Less well characterized are MyD88-independent pathways emanating from subsets of TLRs. These pathways are most clearly defined for TLR4 that recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Recent studies have identified Toll-IL1 receptor domain (TIR)-containing adapter inducing IFN-β (TRIF) as a central component of MyD88-independent MAPK and NF-κB activation (61, 62).

Reticuloendotheliosis (Rel)/NF-κB molecules are a diverse collection of heterodimers consisting of RelA/p65, RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-κB2 (p52 and its precursor p100). Each of these molecules possesses a conserved Rel homology region (RHR). The RHR promotes dimerization, DNA binding, and interaction with inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) molecules. Only RelA and c-Rel

Fig. 2. Overview of TLR-triggered MAPK/NF-κB-signaling pathways. Microbial stimulation through TLR/MyD88 results in a cascade of events, beginning with sequential recruitment of TRAF6 and IRAK1/4 and association of the latter molecules with TAK1/TAB1/TAB2. Subsequent activation of TAK1, a MAP3K family member, leads to IKK activation followed by IκB degradation and subsequent NF-κB nuclear translocation. TAK1 also activates MAPK kinases that themselves activate SAPK/JNK, p38, and Erk1/2 MAPKs, resulting in transcription factor activation. MyD88-independent pathways that originate from TLR3 and TLR4 are not shown here. See text for details.

possess strong transcriptional activating domains (63, 64). Of these, c-Rel appears to be predominantly required in the LPS-induced NF-κB activation pathway that leads to IL-12(p40) induction (65). NF-κB dimers lacking transcriptional activating domains (e.g., p50) may be more important as negative regulators of NF-κB (66). The inhibitory molecules IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε are related to p100 and p105 by way of ankyrin-repeat domains. They function to maintain NF-κB in an inactive state in the cytoplasm by masking nuclear localization sequences of the latter. When IκB molecules, most prominently IκBα, undergo phosphorylative activation, they are targeted for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation as a result of the activity of IκB-targeted ubiquitin ligases. Degradation of IκB reveals NF-κB nuclear localization sequences, and the latter molecule undergoes nuclear translocation (Fig. 2). Genes whose promoters contain κB-binding sites are
then targeted for transcriptional activation. One such NF-κB-regulated gene is that encoding IkB. Newly synthesized IkB translocates to the nucleus and binds NF-κB, terminating its activity and mediating nuclear export of the complex (67).

The MAPK-signal transduction pathways are highly conserved cascades important in diverse aspects of the immune response (68) (Fig. 2). They form a family of protein kinases that include extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 MAPK, and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK). The MAPKs may be present in both cytosolic and nuclear compartments. Upon activation, they themselves activate transcription factors including NF-IL-6, Elk-1, activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), and c-Jun. MAPKs may also activate other protein kinases such as MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (69).

MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation of Thr-X-Tyr tripeptide motifs mediated by upstream MAPK kinases (MKKs). The MKKs in turn are activated by MKK kinases (M3Ks), a prominent one of which is TAK1 (Fig. 2). Components in the MAPK activation pathway are proposed to interact with scaffold proteins that serve to create a functional MAPK-signaling module (70). Gram-negative LPS is a potent macrophage stimulus of the three major MAPKs. Studies with small molecule inhibitors of p38 MAPK as well as MKK3⁻/⁻ mice that lack a major upstream kinase of p38 MAPK have implicated the p38 MAPK-signaling cascade in macrophage TNF-α and IL-12 production during LPS stimulation (71–74).

Deactivation of MAPK is accomplished by induction of dual specificity MAPK phosphatases that can themselves be under the control of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK (75–77). The MKKs are also subject to deactivation by phosphatases such as serine/threonine protein phosphatase type-2Ca that inhibits p38 and SAPK/JNK MAPK by dephosphorylating MKK6, MKK4, and p38 MAPK itself (78). The multiple levels of MAPK control are likely an indication of the need to tightly regulate the activity of these complex signaling cascades.

### Toxoplasma encounter with Rel/NF-κB

The NF-κB-signal transduction pathway is well known for its prominent role in switching on genes involved in proinflammatory as well as anti-apoptotic responses predicted to be important in the response to microbial pathogens (79). These include IL-12(p40), TNF-α and iNOS, and NOS2, genes whose products play an important role in resistance and sometimes pathology during Toxoplasma infection (40, 80–82). Thus, the prediction would be that NF-κB activation

should be an important component in host defense against the parasite. To a large extent, this assumption is true, but the situation is complex.

Gene knockout studies have revealed diverse roles for NF-κB family members during innate and acquired immunity during infection (79). For example, RelB is required for innate NK-cell and adaptive T-cell responses during Toxoplasma infection, and without this NF-κB molecule, mice succumb during early infection (83). While p52 knockout mice develop effective IFN-γ responses and survive acute infection, T cells undergo increased apoptosis associated with lethal toxoplasmic encephalitis during chronic stage disease (84). This phenotype is consistent with the well-known role of NF-κB signaling in activation of anti-apoptotic genes (85, 86). In the presence of a lineage-specific transgene inhibitor of NF-κB, T-lymphocyte and NK-cell effectors fail to expand and produce IFN-γ, resulting in increased susceptibility to infection (87). Studies in c-Rel-deficient mice have led to the surprising conclusion that, while this Rel/NF-κB family member is required for LPS-induced macrophage IL-12 production, it is not required for release of this cytokine by macrophages, dendritic cells, or neutrophils during stimulation with soluble tachyzoite extract (65, 88). Nevertheless, in the absence of c-Rel, T-cell activation, proliferation, and IFN-γ production are defective, and the animals ultimately succumb from severe toxoplasmic encephalitis (13). Inasmuch as these studies underscore the important role for Rel/NF-κB family members in adaptive immunity to infection, it is surprising that data supporting the significance of these transcription factors in the innate immune response to *T. gondii* are rather scarce.

Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the macrophage NF-κB activation cascade is deactivated by Toxoplasma. An examination of RelA/p65 and c-Rel revealed that neither transcription factor undergoes translocation during in vitro infection with the high virulence RH parasite strain (89, 90). Indeed, 2 h pre-infected cells fail to undergo NF-κB translocation when subjected to LPS triggering via TLR4 (89). In such cells, there is also a parasite dose-dependent blockade in endotoxin-induced IL-12(p40) and TNF-α production (Fig. 3). Although synthesis of IL-12(p40) is later initiated, TNF-α remains potently suppressed. These effects are dependent upon presence of live parasites and active host cell invasion (91). The blockade in NF-κB nuclear translocation in macrophages subjected to LPS triggering is restricted to infected cells and is not apparent in surrounding non-infected macrophages. This finding argues for direct inactivation of the NF-κB-signaling pathway by the parasite, rather than release

Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages were infected and then pulsed 2 h later with LPS. After 6 h, cells were fixed and stained with antibodies to TNF-α (green) and parasite SAG-1 (red). Nuclear DNA was stained with propidium iodide and also appears red. Cells were visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Arrows point to tachyzoites in cells that are TNF-α-negative.

nuclear translocation following endogenous IkB degradation (95). In addition, the extracellular bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans produces a factor that inhibits NF-κB nuclear translocation, despite IkB degradation (96). For Toxoplasma infection of macrophages, it has been suggested that tachyzoite heat-shock proteins may enter the host cell cytoplasm and block NF-κB function (97). The precedent for this idea is evidence that endogenous heat-shock proteins can display a similar activity (98).

In parallel with the above studies on NF-κB, it has been reported that T. gondii infection blocks the ability of IFN-γ to activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1). The effect of this blockage is to interfere with upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules in response to IFN-γ, resulting in decreased ability of infected macrophages to present antigenic peptide to an ovalbumin-specific T-cell hybridoma (99, 100). This function is mediated, at least partially, through decreased activation of IFN-γ-induced class II transactivator protein (CIITA) (101). Infection also blocks IFN-γ-induced iNOS upregulation, resulting in increased parasite replication (102). As with NF-κB, Stat1 undergoes phosphorylative activation but fails to translocate into nuclei of infected cells (99), raising the possibility that a common mechanism may be involved in defective nuclear import of NF-κB dimers and Stat1.

Whatever the mechanism, it appears that the block in NF-κB translocation is transient. Thus, while there is an early failure to detect nuclear NF-κB in infected and non-infected cell populations during intraperitoneal infection, by 72 h post-infection, both p50 and p65 are present in nuclei of cells isolated from the peritoneal cavity (90). During in vitro LPS triggering of infected macrophages, we found that, by 6 h post-infection, macrophages have regained the ability to translocate NF-κB in response to endotoxin stimulation (103). It is tempting to speculate that the release in inhibition of NF-κB translocation is functionally related to delayed IL-12 production occurring during Toxoplasma infection of macrophages (91). However, tachyzoites alone do not induce detectable NF-κB translocation, even up to 24 h after in vitro infection (89). While it is possible that small amounts of NF-κB translocation, below detection levels, are sufficient to drive delayed IL-12 production, absence of a c-Rel requirement raises the possibility that the parasite induces NF-κB-independent IL-12 production (88).

Nevertheless, like Toxoplasma, some pathogens can disable NF-κB nuclear translocation following IkB degradation. African swine fever virus encodes an ankyrin repeat-containing protein similar to IkB that appears to function as a dominant negative inhibitor by binding to host NF-κB and preventing its

Absence of NF-κB translocation during Toxoplasma infection may be a cell-specific phenomenon. While we and others do not detect translocation in infected macrophages (89, 90), it has recently been reported that murine embryonic fibroblasts
undergo p50 and p65 nuclear translocation during infection (104, 105). Activation of NF-κB in these cells has been tied to induction of anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl-2, and inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) proteins. This provides a possible explanation for the now well-established ability of T. gondii to induce resistance to apoptosis inducers in infected cells (106, 107). Interestingly, in these studies, host IkB was reported to be concentrated around the parasitophorous vacuole (105). This intriguing finding raises the possibility that T. gondii, like the transforming apicomplexan parasite Theileria parva, may actively hijack the NF-κB-signaling pathway during infection (108, 109). Nevertheless, it remains unclear why the same phenomenon is not observed in T. gondii-infected macrophages. The possibility exists that cells, such as macrophages that are critical in host defense, have been specifically targeted by the parasite for NF-κB blockade and suppression of cytokine synthesis (108).

### Toxoplasma manipulation of MAPK pathways

The conclusion that blocking of NF-κB translocation could not fully explain Toxoplasma-mediated inhibitory effects on macrophage function (Fig. 3) prompted us to examine MAPK-signaling cascades that are also involved in microbial antigen-induced cytokine production (71–74). Macrophages exposed to live tachyzoites undergo rapid Erk1/2, SAPK/JNK, and p38 MAPK activation, followed by swift deactivation of each (103, 110). The kinetics of MAPK activation are generally similar among each family member, although activation of SAPK/JNK is consistently weaker than either p38 or Erk1/2. Furthermore, activation driven by Toxoplasma follows similar kinetics to LPS-induced MAPK phosphorylation (103). Why LPS-induced MAPK activation consequently leads to rapid induction of IL-12 and TNF-α, while T. gondii infection that also activates MAPK leads to delayed (for IL-12) or absent (for TNF-α) production, may be partly explained by the blockade in nuclear translocation that is initially enforced by the parasite.

Similar MAPK activation is observed using Trypanosoma cruzi glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored mucin-like glycoproteins (tGPI-mucin). Here, the close parallel between LPS and tGPI-mucin led Gazzinelli and colleagues (111) to conclude that similar signaling pathways were activated by bacterial LPS and protozoan GPI glycoconjugates. Insofar as purified Leishmania lipophosphoglycan activates MAPK family members in a TLR2-dependent cascade, it is noteworthy that Leishmania donovani promastigotes evade MAPK activation during macrophage infection (112–114). While part of this discrepancy may relate to use of different Leishmania species, these findings also point

to the important (but perhaps unsurprising) conclusion that parasite infection and incubation of purified parasite products with macrophages can have distinct effects on proinflammatory-signaling cascades.

Compared with studies exploiting NF-κB knockout mice to examine effects of gene deletion on resistance to infection, there are as yet few corresponding studies employing gene knockouts of MAPK-signaling components. There are two reasons for this lack. First, MAPK-signaling pathways contain a high degree of functional redundancy, so that, in the absence of one particular kinase, others can substitute. Second, knockout of key MAPK components, such as p38, confers an embryonic lethal phenotype (68). Use of a knockout approach for animal resistance studies will require generation of conditional mutants, multiple gene knockout strains, or chemical inhibitors capable of in vivo function.

Tachyzoite infection results in MAPK activation followed by prompt deactivation, but when cells are subjected to subsequent TLR4 triggering with highly purified LPS, the cells display defective MAPK rephosphorylation (103). The refractoriness in MAPK activation resembles endotoxin-induced tolerance, but it is not the same. LPS tolerance is likely to encompass multiple molecular mechanisms (115). Several studies implicate deactivation of early steps in the TLR4-signaling cascade in LPS tolerance, such as TLR4 downregulation and defective IRAK activation, the latter possibly a result of phosphatase activity (76, 116–119). Induction of downregulatory NF-κB p50 homodimers may also underlie defective macrophage responses during endotoxin tolerance (66, 120). The net result appears to be global shut-down of the TLR-signaling pathways, encompassing MAPK and NF-κB activation cascades (Fig. 4).

Toxoplasma exerts distinct and more specific effects on deactivation of these signaling cascades (103). Rather than being down-regulated, TLR4 expression increases in Toxoplasma-infected cells. Unlike endotoxin tolerance, LPS-induced IkB degradation continues to occur in infected cells (regardless of the fact that NF-κB translocation is defective at initial time points). In addition, despite inability to reactivate p38 MAPK, the major p38-directed MAPK kinases MKK3/6 remain active in parasite-infected macrophages. This finding leads to the conclusion that T. gondii targets p38 MAPK for inactivation either through effects on presently unidentified MKKs or through the activity of regulatory MAPK-directed phosphatases. Therefore, while the end result on MAPK activity is similar in Toxoplasma-infected cells and during endotoxin tolerance, the molecular mechanisms underlying hyporesponsiveness are different (Fig. 4).
Denkers et al · Toxoplasma manipulation of cell signaling

L. major lipophosphoglycan implicate Erk1/2 activation in downregulation of macrophage IL-12 synthesis, although in this case the mechanism involved is unclear (121). In addition, Leishmania infection is associated with increased Src homology-2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) protein tyrosine phosphatase activity that results in impaired IFN-γ-triggered Janus kinase-2 (JAK-2) activation (122). Parasite-induced SHP-1 promotes parasite survival by attenuating both nitric oxide-dependent and -independent macrophage microbicidal effector mechanisms (123). Thus, hijacking of host phosphatases targeting signaling pathways, such as the MAPK cascades, is likely to be a survival strategy common to many intracellular parasites.

Several examples of direct inactivation of MAPK pathways occur during bacterial infections. The Y. pseudotuberculosis YopJ protein binds to members of the MAPK kinase superfamily, blocking both MAPK and NF-κB activation (92). Along similar lines, Bacillus anthracis lethal factor induces macrophage apoptosis by direct cleavage of MAPK kinases that activate p38 (124). As a result, p38 induction of NF-κB-target genes that prevent apoptosis does not occur, rendering cells sensitive to activation-induced cell death. Thus, while MAPK-signaling modules are targeted for disassembly by several microbial pathogens, the mechanisms employed to achieve these ends are diverse.

Receptors and ligands

The host receptors and Toxoplasma ligands that trigger macrophage responses is an area of increasingly active investigation. The TLR family of pattern recognition receptors is implicated, insofar as MyD88 gene-deficient mice possess an extreme susceptibility phenotype that is identical to that of IFN-γ and IL-12 knockout animals (125). Furthermore, innate immune cells from MyD88⁻/⁻ mice display defective IL-12 production during in vitro stimulation with soluble tachyzoite antigen preparations. In this regard, a recent study implicated TLR2 in innate immune recognition of T. gondii (126). Nevertheless, TLR2 gene-deficient animals are considerably more resistant to parasite infection than MyD88⁻/⁻ mice, a finding implicating additional TLRs in optimal resistance to Toxoplasma. Similar conclusions have been reached with regard to T. cruzi infection. Here, macrophages detect tGPI-mucin through TLR2 leading to proinflammatory responses during in vitro culture; yet, during in vivo trypanomastigote infection, TLR2⁻/⁻ animals display a resistant phenotype and are capable of producing nitric oxide and TNF-α (127, 128). In contrast, MyD88 deficiency uniformly confers inability to respond to T. cruzi, resulting in increased susceptibility to infection.

Fig. 4. Contrasting effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pre-exposure and tachyzoite pre-infection on subsequent LPS-triggered-signaling cascades. Endotoxin tolerance encompasses multiple mechanisms. Shown in pink, these include induction of downregulatory NF-κB p50 homodimers, downregulation of TLR4, and interference with early steps in TLR4-signaling cascade. The latter may occur through induction of deactivating phosphatases. Shown in green are effects of Toxoplasma infection. The parasite induces a blockade in NF-κB nuclear translocation, although this effect is not permanent. In addition, tachyzoites block LPS-triggered MAPK activation, most prominently p38 MAPK. The latter may occur through inactivation of a presently unidentified MKK or by induction of a MAPK-directed phosphatase.

Induction of host phosphatases may represent a general strategy employed by intracellular parasites to promote survival. Studies using Trypanosoma tGPI-mucins also implicate phosphatase activity involved in macrophage non-responsiveness. In this case, inhibition of a protein phosphatase Type-2A with okadaic acid reversed tGPI-mucin-induced hyporesponsiveness allowing MAPK activation and TNF-α production (76). Induction of phosphatase activity itself is dependent upon the p38 MAPK- and NF-κB-signaling pathways, as revealed by small molecule inhibitor studies. In this case, microbial signaling through TLR4 (LPS) or TLR2 (tGPI-mucin) triggers MAPK- and NF-κB-signaling cascades that lead to proinflammatory mediator induction as well as autoregulatory pathways that terminate cytokine signaling (76). Other studies with LPS and
Molecular evidence that Toxoplasma expresses multiple molecules that trigger distinct MyD88-dependent pathways comes from our recent studies on mouse polymorphonuclear leukocytes (129). Thus, while tachyzoite antigen elicits neutrophil IL-12 and CCL2 [monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1)] production in strict dependence upon MyD88, CCL2 but not IL-12 production is initiated through TLR2. Furthermore, biochemical analysis of whole soluble tachyzoite lysate separates IL-12- and CCL2-inducing activities into distinct fractions. IL-12 production is sensitive to IL-10 downregulation and Stat-1-dependent upregulation. In contrast, CCL2 release is unaffected by exogenous IL-10, and IFN-γ functions in a partially Stat1-independent manner. In parallel with recent findings by others, these results show that a single microbial pathogen can trigger multiple TLRs, simultaneously switching on distinct signaling cascades that culminate in non-identical cytokine responses (130). Our findings also provide a potential explanation for differences in susceptibility of MyD88 versus TLR2 gene-deficient mice encountering Toxoplasma. Defects in TLR2-dependent CCL2 production could lead to suboptimal host defense that nevertheless remains much greater than resistance in the absence of MyD88, where lack of IL-12 results in failure to initiate adaptive immunity. Additional complexity is added by the recent report suggesting that macrophage IL-12 induction by Toxoplasma displays a strain-specific dependency (131).

GPI anchors are abundantly expressed on the surface of many protozoan parasites, and these molecules are emerging as important regulators of innate immunity (132). The immunostimulatory activities of GPI from Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte stage parasites and in particular *T. cruzi* trypanomastigotes are now well documented (133, 134). The major surface antigens expressed on the surface of *T. gondii* tachyzoites are GPI-anchored proteins (135, 136). A recent study reported that highly purified GPI from virulent RH strain parasites possess TNF-α-inducing activity on macrophages. Chemically synthesized GPI lacking the lipid moiety also displayed immunostimulatory activity, suggesting the glycan portion as possessing biological activity (137). As *T. cruzi* GPI structures stimulate macrophages through TLR2 (128), it is tempting to speculate that TLR2-dependent effects during *T. gondii* infection are mediated by tachyzoite GPI molecules.

If *T. gondii* possesses macrophage-activating GPI structures, why do tachyzoites suppress production of TNF-α and other proinflammatory mediators? It is likely that this apparent paradox relates to how the parasite stimulus is delivered. The ability of Toxoplasma to block macrophage cytokine synthesis is dependent upon live parasites. Neither heat-killed and

opsonized parasites nor soluble tachyzoite lysate preparations display suppressive activity (91). Thus, within the context of live infection, immunostimulatory properties of surface or shed GPI moieties might be overridden by the suppressive properties of the parasite. In addition, in the Toxoplasma-GPI study by Debierre-Grockiego et al. (137), it is noted that only individually separated parasite GPI possessed stimulatory activity. Thus, other molecules, possibly GPI-related glycolipids that have been shown to possess immunosuppressive properties in other protozoan species (112, 132), may neutralize *T. gondii* GPI activity.

In addition to GPI molecules, Toxoplasma possesses an 18-kDa cyclophilin molecule (C-18) that is released by extracellular tachyzoites (46, 138). The C-18 protein has been shown to trigger dendritic cell IL-12 production in a manner dependent upon binding to chemokine receptor CCR5. Thus, gene-deficient mice lacking CCR5 display increased susceptibility to *T. gondii*, and dendritic cells from the animals are defective in parasite-triggered IL-12 production. Chemokine receptors are seven transmembrane domain molecules that signal through G-protein-dependent pathways, and the ability of pertussis toxin, a G-protein uncoupler, to antagonize the IL-12-inducing effects of C-18 implicates this signaling cascade in parasite-driven cytokine production. The results indicate that, in addition to TLR ligand signaling through MyD88 to induce IL-12, Toxoplasma induces DC IL-12 production through C-18, which acts as a chemokine mimic by binding to CCR5.

### Cytokines and gene arrays

In our studies, we find that mouse macrophages are actively suppressed in ability to produce TNF-α during *T. gondii* infection, and IL-12 production occurs only after a delay relative to LPS (91). There is currently some debate in the field regarding the comparative ability of live tachyzoites and soluble tachyzoite extracts to induce macrophage IL-12. For example, some recent studies show a requirement for IFN-γ priming in detection of IL-12, whereas others do not (88, 125). This contradiction at least partly may be the result of using different macrophage sources. Thus, we recently reported that IFN-γ priming was necessary for *T. gondii*-induced IL-12 production when using thioglycollate-elicited macrophages but not when using bone marrow-derived cells (139). The parasite strain has been reported to influence IL-12 production, with low-virulence Type-II strains inducing more macrophage IL-12 than the high-virulence RH strain that is commonly used for in vitro studies (131). Whatever the case, there seems no doubt that tachyzoites and their extracts induce macrophage
IL-12, even if the cytokine is initially suppressed by Toxoplasma. Differences in macrophage IL-12 production are likely to be more quantitative than qualitative in nature.

Although studies on cytokine induction by T. gondii often focus on IL-12 and other proinflammatory mediators, gene microarray analysis has recently been employed to examine global gene expression patterns following infection. These studies give us a glimpse of the extent to which Toxoplasma infects cells in a silent way that would result from suppression or failure to induce a response. A comparative study of human peripheral blood-derived monocytes and dendritic cells revealed distinct patterns of gene regulation during tachyzoite infection, with dendritic cells being generally more responsive (140). In support of findings in mouse macrophages (89, 91), transcript levels of many genes known to be under NF-κB control stay at basal levels during T. gondii infection, despite being upregulated by infections with Leishmania and M. tuberculosis (140). In contrast, many genes, including those belonging to the NF-κB pathway (NFKB1, NFKB2, RELA, and RELB), are up-regulated by Toxoplasma.

Two studies have independently examined gene expression profile in human fibroblasts undergoing tachyzoite infection (141, 142). Within 1–2 h of infection, a small subset of genes was induced, a proportion of which encoded proteins associated with the immune response (IL-1b, IL-6, NF-κB p50, and IkBα). Soluble secreted factors from extracellular tachyzoites upregulated these early response genes, indicating absence of a requirement for active invasion. As with phagocytes, TNF-α failed to upregulate at early (1–2 h) or late (24 h) times post-infection (142). A similar study that examined gene expression at late time points (18–24 h after infection) found upregulation of genes encoding IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and MIP-2α among 17 strongly induced genes (141). The take-home message from these studies is that failure to respond and suppression of cytokine synthesis are not global features of infection in macrophages, dendritic cells, or fibroblasts. Nevertheless, it should be noted that data in two of these studies were obtained from single relatively late time points (16–24 h post-infection). It is possible that earlier time points would reveal distinct gene-clustering patterns.

Finally, it is remarkable that microarray analyses as well as our own studies have consistently found that Toxoplasma lacks ability to upregulate TNF-α expression across different cell types and times of infection. Inasmuch as in vivo infection clearly induces TNF-α (82, 143), it is possible that the cytokine is induced as an indirect effect of the parasite. Proof-of-principle for this concept comes from in vitro studies demonstrating that soluble factors released by parasite-stimu-

![Figure 5](#fig5)

Fig. 5. Model for effects of *Toxoplasma gondii* on signaling pathways leading to macrophage cytokine production. We hypothesize that molecules secreted by tachyzoites, possibly released during host cell penetration or perhaps delivered across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM), trigger signal transduction cascades leading to induction of interleukin-12 (IL-12) synthesis. At the same time, Toxoplasma blocks TLR4 (and possibly other receptor)-mediated signal cascades that culminate in coinduction of IL-12 and TNF-α. Current data favor the hypothesis that inhibitory signaling originates from live tachyzoites contained within the PVM.

lated neutrophils, but not parasite antigens themselves, trigger high-level dendritic cell TNF-α production (144).

### Cellular basis of parasite-host cell communication

During in vitro culture, extracellular tachyzoites release factors, such as C-18, that can trigger IL-12 production (138). Spontaneous release of dense granules or background lysis of extracellular parasites could both provide sources of antigen, triggering cell-signaling pathways through surface receptors such as TLRs or CCR5 (145) (Fig. 5). Although direct evidence is lacking, parasite invasion, during which micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules sequentially discharge, could also provide an activating stimulus (20). In addition, it is possible that antigen may be delivered across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, bypassing the need for surface receptors (Fig. 5).

The requirements for parasite blocking of LPS-induced cytokine signaling appear distinct. Here, parasite lysates and parasite secretion products cannot mediate suppression. Further insight comes from inclusion of cytochalasin B during in vitro infection. This drug blocks invasion while allowing tachyzoite adherence and discharging of micronemes and rhoptries, because host cell penetration involves parasite actin-based motility. Cytochalasin B inhibits the ability of T. gondii to block LPS-induced responses (91). Furthermore, by drug killing intracellular parasites, their ability to block LPS-induced
TNF-$\alpha$ is relieved (91). These results suggest that messages to terminate host signaling may be delivered across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) or during early invasion, rather than at the cell surface (Fig. 5).

How are the messages delivered? Tachyzoite proteins such as ROP2 and GRA5 are known to span the PVM in such a way that they partially penetrate into the host cell cytosol (146, 147). This penetration can have profound effects on the host cells. For example, ROP2 is involved in recruitment of mitochondria that is associated with infection (24). In principle, such PVM-spanning molecules could hijack host cell-signaling pathways. Furthermore, the possibility exists that yet-to-be-identified parasite molecules are specifically directed across the PVM into the cytoplasm, where they might target host-signaling cascades.

### Conclusions and future perspectives

Intracellular protozoans, such as *T. gondii*, must cope with the potentially hostile environment of the host cell. The view that *Toxoplasma* achieves this goal solely by sequestering itself within a secluded vacuole requires revision. Studies by us and others are revealing the multiple ways that the parasite manipulates host cell-signaling cascades to effect ends such as proinflammatory cytokine shutdown and inhibition of programmed cell death. Given the complex biology of *Toxoplasma*, it is assured that determining mechanisms of how this microorganism exerts its influence on host-signaling cascades will direct scientists down fascinating avenues of research for many years to come.
