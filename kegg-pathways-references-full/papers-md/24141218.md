SIRTUINS

# Longevity focuses on NAD⁺

NAD⁺-dependent deacetylases of the sirtuin family have long been implicated in lifespan regulation, and the significance and molecular mechanism (or mechanisms) of this effect have engendered spirited debate. Two articles now spotlight the catabolism of NAD⁺ itself as a mediator of lifespan regulation.

Heinrich Jasper

The role of NAD⁺-metabolizing enzymes in influencing longevity was initially identified through genetic studies in yeast that found the NAD⁺-dependent Sir2 histone deacetylase as a critical component of lifespan extension in a model for calorie restriction¹. Subsequent work has identified orthologs of Sir2 in worms, flies and mice (so-called sirtuins) as potential lifespan-regulating proteins, although debate on whether the longevity-promoting effects of sirtuins are robust and reproducible has never abated (refs. 2, 3 and references therein). At the center of this controversy are the questions of whether increasing Sir2 expression or activity in invertebrate model organisms is sufficient to extend lifespan and whether sirtuin genes are indeed required for lifespan extension by dietary restriction. Recent studies, however, have started to go beyond the controversy to characterize the physiological effects and molecular targets of sirtuins⁴⁻⁸. These studies demonstrate that, by deacetylating specific targets, sirtuins affect a wide range of physiological processes, promoting metabolic homeostasis and DNA repair and extending healthspan⁴⁻⁸. However, two recent studies further refocus our perception of the importance of sirtuin function toward sirtuin consumption of NAD⁺ (refs. 9, 10), suggesting that this seemingly unimportant byproduct may have unexpected roles in aging.

NAD⁺ is a central cofactor in the cell, responsible for maintaining redox balance along with its counterpart, NADH. It is degraded into nicotinamide (NAM) and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose by the sirtuin-mediated deacetylation reaction. In their report, Mouchiroud *et al.*⁹ show that changes in NAD⁺ levels, initiated by the NAD⁺-consuming DNA-repair protein poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), could significantly affect worm lifespan. Accordingly, PARP inhibition, and the resulting accumulation of NAD⁺, extends lifespan in a Sir2-dependent manner.

Two responses are triggered by elevated NAD⁺ levels: a mitochondrial unfolded protein response and a hormetic transient reactive oxygen species (ROS) signal induced by mitochondria that engages the ROS-responsive transcription factors and well-established longevity genes encoding DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/NRF2. In this issue, Schmeisser *et al.*¹⁰ provide further insight into the role of NAD⁺ metabolism in lifespan regulation. Notably, the authors observe lifespan extension when supplementing worms with 1-methyl nicotinamide (MNA), the methylation product and main downstream catabolite of NAM. Using genetic approaches, the authors show that the SIRT1 homolog SIR-2.1 is required for lifespan extension by nicotinic acid (a source of NAD⁺) supplementation but not for lifespan extension by NAM or MNA supplementation, placing NAM and MNA downstream of SIR2 in lifespan regulation (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the authors show that the enzymes mediating the catabolism of NAM are also required for lifespan extension in this pathway. In a series of similar chemical and genetic epistasis experiments, the authors delineate a chain of events that extend lifespan in worms in response to MNA supplementation and that involves MNA oxidation by the phase I detoxification enzyme aldehyde oxidase (AOx1; GAD-3 in worms), concurrent production of H₂O₂, and subsequent transient activation of DAF-16 and SKN-1, which stimulate cytoprotective gene expression.

NAD⁺ levels, and it can be anticipated that similar effects will be observed in more complex organisms. However, the implications of these studies are also somewhat puzzling, as they suggest that the specific deacetylations of sirtuin targets are at best secondary for their lifespan effects. Elucidating the relative contribution of NAD⁺ consumption and specific deacetylation events in the control of specific cellular processes and physiological

Schmeisser et al.¹⁰ show that longevity requires NAM methylation by NNMT and subsequent oxidation of MNA, the methylated product, by AOx1. NAD⁺ metabolism also affects mitochondrial biogenesis and mitonuclear balance, resulting in activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRᴹᵀ) and transient production of ROS⁹. Transient ROS production by either the AOx1 reaction or by mitochondria results in SKN-1/NRF2 and DAF-16/FOXO activation, promoting longevity.*

The emerging central role of NAD⁺ metabolism in lifespan regulation suggests avenues of new and interesting research to be explored, especially toward clinical intervention against age-associated pathologies. In particular, it will be fascinating to assess the potential lifespan consequences of pharmacological inhibitors and activators of enzymes involved in NAD⁺ metabolism. Mouchiroud *et al.*⁹ initiated such work by showing that PARP inhibitors can extend lifespan in worms by increasing

events will be an interesting task for the future. Similarly, a number of discrepancies in the models developed by the new studies will have to be resolved: though Mouchiroud *et al.*⁹ highlight the effects of NAD⁺ levels on mitochondrial function, Schmeisser *et al.*¹⁰ could not confirm a previously reported inhibition of complex I of the electron transport chain by MNA¹¹. Both studies, however, find a transient ROS signal as a downstream mediator of NAD⁺-induced longevity, generated by either mitochondria⁹ or by AOX1 (ref. 10). Whether only one or both of these transient ROS sources are involved in the activation of DAF-16 and SKN-1 will have to be established in future work.

Another discrepancy between the two studies is the fact that PARP inhibition (which increases NAD levels and should result in decreased NAM production by PARP) is found to extend lifespan by Mouchiroud *et al.*⁹, whereas NAM production is required for lifespan extension, according to Schmeisser *et al.*¹⁰ One explanation of this difference may be that the surplus NAD⁺ generated by inhibition of PARP is shunted into increased Sir2 activity, which in turn results in increased NAM production (Fig. 1). It can be expected that interesting controversies and new insights will be generated by efforts to resolve these questions.

MEMBRANE PROTEINS

# Through thick and thin

The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is regulated by changes in the host lipid bilayer composition and has been studied extensively to elucidate the relative importance of specific lipid-protein interactions versus more general nonspecific bilayer-protein interactions in the regulation of membrane protein function. Experiments reported in this issue provide strong support for the importance of lipid bilayer physical properties and lipid bilayer-membrane protein hydrophobic mismatch in the regulation of nAChR function.

Olaf S Andersen

It long has been known that the nAChR is exquisitely sensitive to the composition of its host bilayer¹². The key evidence for this regulation has been provided by the reconstitution of the nAChR into lipid bilayers of different composition, which showed that successful reconstitution of functional channels requires a special lipid environment that includes anionic phospholipids and cholesterol, though the lipid specificity is modest. The nAChR has some preference for phosphatidic acid, but successful reconstitution can be attained using a variety of anionic phospholipids, with a tendency toward reduced reconstitution of functional channels with increasing head group volume³. Similarly, cholesterol can be replaced by other sterols and various neutral lipids⁴.

That agonists cannot activate nAChR reconstituted in the absence of anionic phospholipids and cholesterol means that the channels’ lipid environment modulates the distribution among activatable and nonactivatable nAChR conformations. The classic nonactivatable nAChR is in the so-called desensitized state⁵, an agonist-bound, closed channel that cannot be activated by further increases in agonist concentration. nAChR that is reconstituted into bilayers without anionic phospholipids and cholesterol is not, however, in the desensitized state³. Using the fluorescent probe ethidium⁶, which binds with high affinity to open and desensitized conformations and with low affinity to the resting (closed) conformation, daCosta and Baenziger⁷ found that ethidium does not bind the nonactivatable state that is observed when nAChR is reconstituted into phospholipid lipid bilayers lacking anionic phospholipids and cholesterol. This nonactivatable nAChR does bind agonists, however, which led to the conclusion that nAChRs reconstituted in bilayers without anionic phospholipids and cholesterol are uncoupled, in the sense that ligand binding is not coupled to channel activation (pore opening). The major effect of altering the channels’ lipid environment is thus to shift the distribution between activatable (coupled) and nonactivatable (uncoupled) conformations (Fig. 1), leaving unclear whether the lipid effects were due to chemically specific lipid-nAChR interactions or to less specific bilayer-nAChR interactions.

daCosta *et al.*⁸ now report results that weigh in on the side of nonspecific interactions, as they show pronounced differences in the behavior of the uncoupled states that are observed when nAChR is reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine bilayers with different thickness. When reconstituted into 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayers, the uncoupled nAChR cannot convert (in the presence of agonist) to the coupled (activatable) conformation (or conformations); when reconstituted into 1,2-dierucoyl-*sn*-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayers, which have 22-carbon-long monounsaturated acyl chains, the presence of agonist leads to the conversion of the uncoupled nAChR into the coupled conformation (or conformations). The transition between the uncoupled and the coupled (resting, open and desensitized) conformations is remarkably slow, however, occurring over minutes to hours—in contrast to the microsecond-to-millisecond kinetics of the agonist-induced resting-to-open transitions. That the conversion
