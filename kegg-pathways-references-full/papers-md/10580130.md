Abstract

Glycoproteins with O-glycosidically linked carbohydrate chains of complex structures and functions are found in secretions and on the cell surfaces of cancer cells. The structures of O-glycans are often unusual or abnormal in cancer, and greatly contribute to the phenotype and biology of cancer cells. Some of the mechanisms of changes in O-glycosylation pathways have been determined in cancer model systems. However, O-glycan biosynthesis is a complex process that is still poorly understood. The glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases that synthesize O-glycans appear to exist as families of related enzymes of which individual members are expressed in a tissue- and growth-specific fashion. Studies of their regulation in cancer may reveal the connection between cancerous transformation and glycosylation which may help to understand and control the abnormal biology of tumor cells. Cancer diagnosis may be based on the appearance of certain glycosylated epitopes, and therapeutic avenues have been designed to attack cancer cells via their glycans. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

### 1. Introduction

GalNAc-Ser or -Thr O-linked oligosaccharides (O-glycans) have been found on soluble, secreted and membrane-bound glycoproteins, and on proteoglycans in cancer cells. Mucins, the main class of O-glycosylated glycoproteins, are of very large molecular weight, and have Ser/Thr/Pro-rich tandem repeat regions which are heavily O-glycosylated. Nine human mucins, which can be secreted or membrane-bound, have been characterized [1]. In addition, cancer cells may contain membrane-bound mucin-like glycoproteins which have O-glycan-rich domains. The gene expression of these glycoproteins is cell-specific and often altered in cancer. The protein backbone influences glycosylation, and alterations of proteins in cancer therefore may result in glycosylation changes.

The functions of O-glycans are as diverse as their structures. O-Glycans protect underlying proteins as well as epithelial cell surfaces, maintain protein conformations, control active epitopes and antigenicity; they participate in cell adhesion, sperm-egg binding, binding to microbes and in the immune system. They may determine the cell surface expression and function of cell surface receptors and may be involved in growth regulation. O-Glycans have also been shown to be involved in blood clotting, embryogenesis, development and cell death [2,3].

In cancer, O-glycans play important roles in the attachment and invasion of cancer cells and their survival in the bloodstream. O-Glycan chains of glycoproteins, as well as tissue and blood group antigens, including Lewis antigens, may be qualitatively and quantitatively altered, and are often truncated and highly sialylated in cancer cells [1,2,4–6]. The biology, physiology and immunological properties of a cancer cell are greatly influenced by the structures of glycoproteins present on their cell surfaces or in their secretions. Unusual or novel carbohydrate and peptide structures may lead to immune responses in cancer patients. Anti-mucin antibodies have been proposed to have therapeutic potential in cancer [7]. To exploit the immune response therapeutically, mucin-like antigens with cancer-specific epitopes have been developed as a vaccine [8–11]. MUC1 peptides injected into mice delayed tumor growth of mammary epithelial cancer cells [12,13]. Altered antigenicities of mucin peptides and carbohydrates may also be useful for diagnosis and to evaluate the stage of cancer.

In the early 1970s, Harry Schachter pursued his fascination of the wealth of potential biochemical information imprinted in the complex structures of
mucin-type $O$-glycans. Very few of the glycosyltransferases had been described, and a tissue synthesizing mucin, such as the porcine submaxillary gland, seemed to be a treasure chest for the discovery of new enzyme activities. Schachter's group described several novel glycosyltransferase activities and contributed to the elucidation of $O$-glycan biosynthetic pathways and the precise specificities of glycosyltransferases. It became clear that tissues differ not only in the structures of mucin $O$-glycans, but also in the expression and properties of enzymes.

The specificity studies and cloning of glycosyltransferases from different cell types revealed significant differences between enzymes with similar activities. The established theory of 'one enzyme – one linkage' had to be revised to 'one enzyme family – usually one linkage'. Schachter recognized that competition between two enzymes acting on the same substrate, and the creation of enzyme products that would either block or facilitate further glycosylation due to the substrate specificity of enzymes acting downstream would regulate the direction of biosynthetic pathways and could therefore create a distinct spectrum of possible $O$-glycan structures. Details on the biosynthesis of $O$-glycans and the cloning of glycosyltransferases have been outlined in many reviews by H. Schachter [14–18].

The appearance of altered glycans, glycoproteins and glycosyltransferases is functionally important although it is still unknown how this is linked to the abnormal cell growth and cell death of cancer cells. In a number of cancer models, the specific enzymes responsible for changes have been determined, paving the way for further investigations of the connection between glycosylation and cancerous growth. This review is concerned with the rearrangements of biosynthetic pathways of $O$-glycans that lead to abnormal structures and functions of glycoproteins in tumor cells.

### 2. Structures of $O$-glycans

Several hundreds of different $O$-glycan structures have been described in mucins, yet little is known about their specific functions. The tremendous structural variation is due to the fact that at least eight different core structures of $O$-glycans exist in mammalian mucins. Core structures 1–6 (Table 1) have been described in human cancer cells. Additional core structures exist in mucins from other species, for example in frogs.

GalNAc $O$-glycosidically linked to Ser or Thr residues (Tn antigen, Table 2) is the only structure common to all $O$-glycans. The Tn antigen may be sialylated to form the sialyl-Tn antigen, sialylα2-6GalNAc-. Alternatively, core structures may be synthesized. Depending on the availability and specificity of glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases involved, $O$-glycan cores may be elongated and terminated in many ways; they may be short and terminated by sialic acid, or may be elongated, for example by repeating Galβ1–4 GlcNAc units to form poly $N$-acetyllactosamine chains (i antigen, Table 2). The $N$-acetyllactosamine backbone may be branched by a GlcNAcβ1–6 residue, linked to Gal or GalNAc (I antigen). Sugars occurring at the non-reducing termini include sialic acid residues, Fuc, Gal, GlcNAc

and GalNAc. Many of these terminal structures are blood group and tissue antigens (Table 2). Sulfate esters, linked to the 6-position of GlcNAc, or the 3- or 6-position of Gal are also terminal structures. Core structures often change in cancer; the consequence of this may be a dramatic alteration of terminal structures and functional groups.

### 3. O-Glycan biosynthesis

O-Glycans are assembled by series of reactions catalyzed by glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases in the Golgi. In cancer cells, many of the enzymes involved in O-glycan biosynthesis are up- or down-regulated [1,2,18–21]. A number of factors

have been proposed to regulate the biosynthesis of O-glycans and thus the relative amounts of glycoprotein-bound oligosaccharides. The gene expression of glycosyltransferases, and of their protein substrates, may be altered during growth, cell differentiation and tumorigenesis. Factors that control the activities of transferases in vitro include metal ion concentrations and the presence of certain proteins and lipids, and post-translational modifications of enzyme proteins.

In the O-glycan pathways, every sugar is transferred from a specific nucleotide sugar donor by the action of specific membrane-bound glycosyltransferases. Sulfate is transferred from 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate by sulfotransferases [19,22], the first sugar being added in the cis-Golgi and possibly also in later Golgi compartments. Golgi glycosyltransferases have a type II membrane protein structure with a short cytoplasmic tail at the amino terminus, a membrane anchor region, and a catalytic domain at the carboxy terminus which is directed into the lumen of the Golgi. Although no specific Golgi localization sequence could be identified, it is clear from studies on a number of glycosyltransferases that the anchor region as well as adjacent amino acid sequences and other protein determinants play a role in Golgi localization. The interactions of transferase protein with lipid and other protein components of Golgi membranes may also be important factors in regulating activities and targeting of transferases to specific Golgi compartments [23,24].

The donor substrates, nucleotide sugars and 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate are transported into the Golgi from the cytosol. This is achieved by specific transporter systems that regulate the supply of sugar donor substrates, and also transport the products of glycosyltransferase reactions, potential inhibitors of glycosyltransferase reactions, out of the Golgi [25].

The pathways of O-glycosylation are determined by the distinct substrate specificities of glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases involved. Transferases recognize specific sugars, sugar sequences, and often peptide moieties of substrates, and with very few exceptions, each type of enzyme synthesizes only one linkage. Glycosyltransferases are thought to be arranged in an assembly line in the Golgi, where early acting enzymes are localized in the cis-Golgi, intermediate acting enzymes in the medial Golgi, and

those adding terminal structures in the trans-Golgi. However, there appears to be extensive overlap of enzyme localization. A rearrangement of a Golgi protein as well as the Tn antigen from the Golgi to the rough endoplasmic reticulum has been observed in human colon cancer cells [26]. This rearrangement of Golgi enzymes may lead to a failure to synthesize essential intermediates or may block further conversions by premature synthesis of terminal structures, and may account for altered glycosylation in cancer. The sequence of sugar additions in specific Golgi compartments is also controlled by the relative activities of glycosyltransferases or sulfotransferases acting on common acceptor substrates. If these enzymes are present in the same Golgi compartment, competition may take place, and the relative activities determine the quantities of possible products.

The peptide moieties of substrates and sugar residues near O-glycosylation sites have been shown to regulate primary O-glycosylation as well as subsequent glycosylation steps. It is thus expected that when the expression of proteins is altered in cancer cells, different glycosyltransferase activities towards altered substrates result. This site-directed processing appears to be particularly important in early O-glycosylation steps.

The cloning of glycosyltransferase genes has revealed that multiple proteins may mediate a specific enzyme activity. Thus one particular linkage may be synthesized by one or more members of a glycosyltransferase family. These individual members of a glycosyltransferase family may exhibit small differences in specificity and their genes may be differently regulated. The cell-type specific expression of these enzymes may explain subtle differences in glycan structures of glycoproteins synthesized in different cell types, and in cancer cells.

### 4. Synthesis of O-glycan core structures

The first enzyme of the O-glycosylation pathways, polypeptide α-GalNAc-transferase, has been described in sheep submaxillary gland by McGuire and Roseman in 1967 [27]. Thirty years later, it became clear that the enzyme is encoded by several different genes [28]. One or more polypeptide α-GalNAc-transferases are expressed in a tissue-specific

fashion in all mammalian and many non-mammalian
species. It is likely that multiple polypeptide α-Gal-
NAc-transferases are expressed in any one cell type.
Human pancreatic, breast and colon cancer cell lines
express mRNA for two constitutively expressed en-
zymes (polypeptide α-GalNAc-transferase T1 and
T2). A third enzyme (T3) appears to be regulated
during cellular differentiation [29]. Polypeptide α-
GalNAc-transferase T4 has a wide tissue distribution
[30].

The coding regions of human polypeptide Gal-
NAc-transferases T1, T2, and T3 are located on sev-
eral exons, and the genes are located on different
chromosomes [30]. In contrast, T4 is encoded on a
single exon. Mice in which a single polypeptide α-
GalNAc-transferase gene was disrupted in lympho-
cytes exhibited an essentially normal phenotype, sug-
gesting that the other enzymes were still actively
involved in O-glycosylation [31]. This apparent
redundancy of enzymes suggests their importance.

In contrast to N-glycosylation, which requires a
specific amino acid sequon, no unique peptide struc-
ture has been identified in a substrate for polypeptide
α-GalNAc-transferase. The acceptor substrate specif-
icity of polypeptide α-GalNAc-transferase has been
subject to intensive investigations [32–39]. Each
member of this enzyme family appears to have a
slightly different, but overlapping, substrate specific-
ity. The specificity of human polypeptide GalNAc-
transferase T4 is distinct since it glycosylates Ser as
well as Thr in specific peptide sequences of MUC1
and the P-selectin ligand PSGL-1 [30]. The bovine
colostrum enzyme (T1) has been shown to prefer
certain amino acid sequences around Ser and Thr
sites, but is also influenced by prior glycosylation
of peptide substrates [40]. Statistical models to calcu-
late the likelihood of O-glycosylation have been pro-
posed. Since these models are based on glycosylation
sites of mostly non-mucin glycoproteins from differ-
ent sources and do not take into account the specif-
icities of the various polypeptide α-GalNAc-transfer-
ases, they are of limited value [41]. The fact that in
vitro Thr-containing peptide substrates are usually
better than those containing Ser has been a puzzling
finding, since Ser also carries O-glycans chains in
vivo.

Using antibodies to the enzyme protein and elec-
tronmicroscopy, polypeptide α-GalNAc-transferase

from porcine and bovine submaxillary gland has
been localized to the cis-Golgi compartment [42]. In
HeLa cells, polypeptide α-GalNAc-transferases T1,
T2 and T3 were found to be distributed throughout
the Golgi. T2 and T3 preferentially localized to the
medial and trans-Golgi compartments [43]. It ap-
pears therefore that the localization of individual
GalNAc-transferase may vary depending on the cell
type and possibly also the differentiation status. It is
conceivable that in cancer cells, the localization of
not only polypeptide α-GalNAc-transferase, but
also of other enzymes in the O-glycosylation path-
ways may differ from the normal. If GalNAc is
added in a later compartment, substrates are not
available for early acting enzymes of the assembly
line, and final structures will be incomplete. Incom-
plete chain synthesis occurs in many cancer cells and
contributes to the prevalent expression of the Tn
antigen (GalNAc-Thr/Ser) (Table 2).

### 4.1. Core 1 synthesis

Core 1 (Table 1) occurs on most glycoproteins,
and is often substituted with sialic acid residues or
with various other sugars. Core 1 as a terminal struc-
ture is prevalent in cancer cells and their secretions
and binds to antibodies directed against the T anti-
gen (Table 2). The enzyme synthesizing core 1, core 1
β3-Gal-transferase, is a ubiquitous enzyme that oc-
curs in most mammalian cells and in many species
[16,19]. The enzyme activity was first demonstrated
by Schachter et al. in 1971 in porcine and bovine
submaxillary glands [44]. The synthesis of core 1 is
a prerequisite for the synthesis of sialylated T anti-
gens, elongated core 1 structures, and core 2 struc-
tures found in glycoproteins.

Very few cells are known to exhibit a deficiency in
core 1 β3-Gal-transferase. Erythrocytes from patients
with permanent mixed-field polyagglutinability
[45,46] highly express the Tn antigen due to lack of
core 1 synthesis. The defect is stable in clones of
patient lymphocytes; however, certain differentiation
agents can induce the core 1 β3-Gal-transferase ac-
tivity [47]. The human T-lymphoblastoid cell line
Jurkat is also deficient in core 1 β3-Gal-transferase
and highly expresses Tn antigen. The defect in Jurkat
cells does not appear to be reversible. Human colon
cancer cells LSC are derived from colon cancer cells

LS174T that synthesize complex O-glycans; LSC cells express Tn and sialyl-Tn antigens and are deficient in core 1 β3-Gal-transferase activity [48]. The defect in LSC cells cannot be reversed by differentiation or by in vivo tumor growth. A similar effect of premature truncation of mucin oligosaccharides can be achieved with the O-glycosylation inhibitor Gal-NAcα-benzyl which inhibits incorporation of sugars into mucins by competing with the natural substrates for the extension of O-glycans [49].

Like many other glycosyltransferases, core 1 β3-

Gal-transferase appears to be regulated during differentiation. In human colonic adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells [50] core 1 β3-Gal-transferase activity decreases during enterocytic differentiation while a number of other glycosyltransferase activities are increased. Core 1 β3-Gal-transferase activity is greatly influenced by peptide sequences of glycopeptide substrates and their glycosylation patterns [51, 52]. Several other glycosyltransferases synthesizing O-glycan cores have been shown to be influenced by the peptide sequences and existing glycosylation (Brockhau-

Fig. 1. Pathways of O-glycan biosynthesis. O-Glycosylation is initiated by the transfer of GalNAcα- to Thr or Ser of the polypeptide backbone. Eight O-glycan core structures can then be synthesized. O-glycan cores 1–6 have been found in mucins or other glycoproteins in cancer cells. The most common O-glycan core structures are cores 1 and 2. Core structures 1–4 in particular are elongated by Gal- and GlcNAc-transferase and/or terminated by Fuc-, sialyl-Gal-, GlcNAc-GalNAc- and/or sulfo-transferases in many different ways. The extensions of core 2 to form N-acetyllactosamine chains (i antigen) and the branched I antigen are shown. SA, sialyl; SO4, sulfate.

sen, in preparation). Thus the synthesis and processing of individual core structures appears to be a function of the *O*-glycosylation sites, which may be changed in cancer due to the differential expression of glycoproteins.

### 4.2. Core 2 and 4 synthesis

The synthesis of core 2 in dog submaxillary glands by the branching enzyme core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase was first reported by Schachter's group [53]. The enzyme converts an unsubstituted *O*-glycan core 1 to core 2, but does not act when core 1 is elongated, sialylated, sulfated or fucosylated (Fig. 1). A number of related β6-GlcNAc-transferases appear to exist with distinct substrate specificities.

Two enzymes synthesizing core 2 have been well characterized and can be distinguished by their substrate specificities and tissue distributions [54]. Core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase (L type) occurs in leukocytes, leukemia cells and many cultured cancer cells and synthesizes only core 2. A soluble recombinant version of the L enzyme, secreted from insect cells, requires *N*-glycans for stability and activity [55]. The M type enzyme activity is found in mucin secreting cell types, including some cancer cells and may form the branches of core 2, core 4 and the I antigen (Fig. 1, Table 2) [54].

Core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase L that acts only on Galβ1–3GalNAc-R substrates has been cloned from HL60 cells [56] and bovine lung [57] and mouse. Another cloned human enzyme has been found to have the specificity of core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase M, and 48% sequence identity with the human L enzyme [58,59]. An enzyme with sequence similarity to core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase L that synthesizes the I antigenic determinant has been cloned from human teratocarcinoma PA1 cells; this enzyme appears to act on internal Gal residues [60,61]. Other members of this β6-GlcNAc-transferase family may synthesize terminal or internal GlcNAcβ1–6 branches, as well as linear GlcNAcβ1–6 Gal(NAc) structures [19] of cores 2, 4, 6 and I determinants (Tables 1 and 2).

Core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase L activity is increased in leukemia, and often altered in cancer cells [62–66]. The core 4 β6-GlcNAc-transferase synthesizing core 4 is active in colonic tissues, and in a number of cancer cell lines, and decreases upon tumorigenesis in a human cell line derived from polyposis coli [64]. Core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase L activity increases during activation of T-lymphocytes [67] and during cellular differentiation [50,68] and is thought to have an important role in the immune system. Mice that overexpress the enzyme in their T-lymphocytes show impaired interactions between T- and B-cells and other malfunctions of the immune response [69]. In an SCID mouse model for thymocyte development, repopulation with bone marrow cells overexpressing murine core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase L caused interference with myeloid differentiation [70].

The enzyme appears to be critical for the expression of sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> selectin ligands [71–74], and thus may control the attachment of cancer cells to the endothelium. Core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase L was transfected into CHO cells lacking the enzyme but expressing the gene encoding the P-selectin ligand PSGL-1 and the enzymes synthesizing sialylated Lewis<sup>x</sup> determinants. This transfection resulted in the expression of P-selectin ligands and cell binding to P-selectin, suggesting that sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> and other selectin ligands in these cells are mainly attached to *O*-glycan core 2 structures.

BT20 and T47D breast cancer cells lack core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase L activity and do not express its mRNA [75]. As a result, *O*-glycan chains are truncated and thus allow access of antibodies to normally masked epitopes [76]. In mammary cells, the enzyme resides mainly in the medial Golgi compartment, as shown by immuno-electronmicroscopy (Whitehouse et al., unpublished). Core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase L, expressed in CHO cells, has been localized to the *cis* to medial Golgi compartments [77].

### 4.3. Synthesis of core structures 3, and 5–8

*O*-Glycan core structures 3–5 (Table 1) occur on normal mucins from specific cell types, and have been reported in mucins from cancer cells [78,79]. Core 3 is particularly prevalent in human colonic and salivary mucins [80,81]. Core 3 is synthesized by core 3 β3-GlcNAc-transferase, discovered in the Schachter laboratory in colonic tissues from several species [82]. The enzyme activity is not detectable in several colon cancer cell lines, and is reduced in co-

lon cancer tissue [66,83]. This shift favors the synthesis of core 1 (Fig. 1), and may explain the prevalence of the T antigen in cancer tissue [84].

There is only limited information on the synthesis of O-glycan core structures 5–8. The sialylated O-glycan core 5 structure (Table 1), sialyl α2–6 (GalNAc α1–3) GalNAc-, occurs in human meconium and in mucin from colonic adenocarcinoma [79,85]. An enzyme activity synthesizing core 5, core 5 α3-GalNAc-transferase, has been demonstrated in the colonic mucosa of a patient with adenocarcinoma [86]. O-Glycan core 6, GlcNAcβ1–6GalNAc-R, has been described in several human glycoproteins, and a β6-GlcNAc-transferase activity synthesizing core 6 has been reported in human ovarian tissue [87]. The O-glycan core 7 structure (Table 1) to date has only been described in bovine submaxillary gland mucin [88]. Human bronchial mucin contains a small amount of O-glycans with core 8 structure [89].

### 5. Elongation of O-glycans

There are many ways by which O-glycan core structures may be processed. Terminal sialic acid or sulfate residues may be added, thus inhibiting further elongation and processing, and resulting in short acidic glycan chains. A common backbone structure, repeating Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3 units (i antigen, poly N-acetyllactosamines, type 2 chains) may be synthesized by the alternating actions of β4-Gal-transferase [90,91] and iβ3-GlcNAc-transferase [92]. The two enzyme activities are ubiquitous, and also act on other glycoconjugates such as N-glycans and glycolipids. The first GlcNAc β1–3-linked to Gal of core structures 1 or 2 (Fig. 1) is added by elongation β3-GlcNAc-transferase, first discovered in H. Schachter's laboratory in pig gastric mucosa [93]. This elongation enzyme has a tissue distribution that differs from that of the ubiquitous iβ3-GlcNAc-transferase, and may be a different enzyme. These two β3-GlcNAc-transferase activities are altered in leukemia cells [62]. Using cDNA libraries from human melanoma and colon cancer cells to transfect human lymphoma Namalwa KJM cells, the cDNA encoding iβ3-GlcNAc-transferase has been cloned [94]. The enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of poly-N-

acetyllactosamine chains and its mRNA appears to be expressed in most human tissues.

In addition to type 2 chains, type 1 chains (Gal β1–3GlcNAc β1–3 units) may be introduced by a β3-Gal-transferase [95,96]. Thus at least two different types of Gal-transferases using GlcNAc as a substrate are involved in the synthesis of poly N-acetyl-lactosamine chains. Genes encoding three β3-Gal-transferases (β3-Gal-transferase I, II and III) with sequence similarity have been isolated from mouse [96] and four β3-Gal-transferases with sequence similarity from human [97]. In contrast to β4-Gal-transferase genes, the coding regions of β3-Gal-transferases are contained in a single exon. In human colonic adenocarcinoma, a low ratio of type 1 to type 2 chains is observed. Correspondingly, the β3-Gal-transferase activity synthesizing type 1 chains is significantly decreased [98].

A number of β6-GlcNAc-transferases can synthesize GlcNAcβ1–6 branches of the elongated backbone structures that constitute the I antigen (Table 2). These enzymes exhibit tissue-specific expression, may have different acceptor substrate specificities and probably occur as a large family of related enzymes. One cloned member of this β6-GlcNAc-transferase family is homologous to core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase, and adds the I antigen branch to leukosialin glycan chains [60]. This enzyme acts on internal Gal residues of Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-R [61], and could thus not be assayed with GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-R substrates. Another β6-GlcNAc-transferase that acts on internal Gal residues has been purified 210 000-fold from pig gastric mucosa [99]. This type of centrally acting enzyme appears to be responsible for the synthesis of branched poly N-acetyllactosamine chains in murine embryonic cancer cells [100].

At least six distinct genes exist encoding a β4-Gal-transferase family [101–106]. β4-Gal-T1 and β4-Gal-T2 are modulated by α-lactalbumin to change the preference for their substrate from GlcNAc to Glc [101,102]. β4-Gal-T3 appears to act preferably on glycolipids, while β4-Gal-T4 acts exclusively on glycolipids [101]. The catalytic efficiency of β4-Gal-T4 is enhanced by α-lactalbumin [107]. Most of the β4-Gal-T genes localized so far were found on chromosome 3q13.3.

Human β4-Gal-transferase (T1) has been cloned
from liver and placenta [107–109]. The expression of β4-Gal-transferase is tissue-specific and is regulated in many disease states [2,4,5,110,111]. β4-Gal-transferase T1 resides mainly in the trans-Golgi, shown by different studies including immuno-electronmicroscopy [112]. Negative and positive regulatory elements which decrease or increase promoter activity have been identified in the β4-Gal-transferase gene [110]. Several alternately utilized promoters produce different transcripts. Thus short and long forms of the enzyme protein are made with identical catalytic region, but differing in the length of the cytoplasmic amino terminus [110,113].

### 6. Synthesis of terminal structures

Terminal sugars and sulfate groups can have important biological roles. For example, the degree of sialylation is important for the overall properties of O-glycans and glycoproteins; in addition, sialylated structures often block subsequent glycosylation steps. Specific structures can serve as antigenic determinants or ligands for cell adhesion molecules such as selectins. Thus poly N-acetyllactosaminoglycans and the Lewis antigens (Table 2) attached to these chains have been implicated in adhesive interactions between tumor cells and activated endothelium. Treatment of cancer cells with GalNAc-benzyl truncates mucin type O-glycans and significantly reduces the binding of colon cancer cells to E-selectin [114].

#### 6.1. Sialylation

A number of cDNAs and genes encoding sialyltransferases have been cloned based on the existence of similar DNA sequences which encode the sialyl-motif [115–117]. A family of α3-sialyltransferases with various specificities towards Galβ-terminating glycans act on O-glycan core 1, core 2 and probably other O-glycan structures [54,118–121]. Most cell types express at least one member of the core 1 α3-sialyltransferase family. Sialyltransferases are often regulated in a cell type and differentiation-specific fashion [117]. The enzyme acting on core 1 (probably ST3Gal I) is developmentally regulated in thymocytes [122] and the activity decreases upon Ha-ras oncogene transfection [123]. α3-Sialyltransferase activities are increased in chronic and acute myeloid leukemia cells [124], and in several cancer models [66,75]. Lymphoid and myeloid derived cell lines express high α3-sialyltransferase activity [125]. HL60, K-562, MOLT-4 and THP-1 cells express α3-sialyltransferase ST3Gal II, and the expression levels change during differentiation of HL60 and THP-1 cells [126].

The increase of α3-sialyltransferase activity is expected to prevent further O-glycan processing, and to terminate O-glycan chains, due to the blocking effect of sialic acid on GlcNAc- or Gal-transferases. Thus in cell types with high sialyltransferase activity, O-glycans produced are short and sialylated. This phenomenon is observed in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells where α3-sialyltransferase activity is increased, the cell surface is hypersialylated [124,127], and the O-glycan structures of leukosialin are less elongated and carry more sialic acid residues compared to normal granulocytes [128].

Similarly, breast cancer cell lines exhibit a high expression of core 1 α3-sialyltransferase compared to normal mammary cells [75]. MUC1 mucin produced in breast cancer cells has shorter and more sialylated O-glycans [129]. The breast cancer cell line MCF-7 has high α3-sialyltransferase activity, but also significant activity of core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase. However, core 2 glycans of MUC1 in these cells are found in reduced amounts compared to normal MUC1. This suggests that the α3-sialyltransferase has the ability to turn off the branching reaction. To demonstrate their intracellular localization, the tagged recombinant enzymes were expressed in mammary cells [130] and visualized by immuno-electronmicroscopy. Most of the α3-sialyltransferase enzyme was present in the trans-Golgi, but a substantial proportion is localized to earlier Golgi compartments. This relatively broad distribution of transferases within the Golgi suggests that the synthesis of core 2 can compete with α3-sialyltransferase (Fig. 2), and termination reactions may block elongation or branching reactions.

Sialyl-Tn antigen, sialylα2–6GalNAc-Thr/Ser (Table 2) is another cancer-associated structure found in glycoproteins from many tumors, but not usually from normal mucosa [131]. The occurrence of sialyl-Tn is associated with a poor prognosis in several types of cancer including colonic, gastric and ovarian

Fig. 2. Competition between core 2 synthesis and sialylation. O-Glycan core 1 is a substrate for several competing enzymes. If core 1 is converted to core 2, it can be further glycosylated to form larger O-glycans. However, if core 1 is acted on by α3-sialyltransferase, only the disialylated core 1 structure can be formed, and an extension to larger O-glycans is blocked. This phenomenon is thought to occur in human breast cancer cells MCF7, in which both the α3-sialyltransferase and core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase are active, yet mucin from MCF7 cells has mainly short and sialylated O-glycans, and exposed peptide epitopes. SA, sialyl.

cancer [132–134]. The sialylα2–6GalNAc-Thr/Ser structure is synthesized by polypeptide α-GalNAc-transferase and α6-sialyltransferase that requires GalNAc-peptide as the substrate. Several species of the α6-sialyltransferase family have been cloned from chick, rat and mouse [135–139]. α6-Sialyltransferase I (ST6GalNAc I) acts on substituted or unsubstituted GalNAc-R substrates while α6-sialyltransferase II (ST6GalNAc II) acts on the GalNAc residue of core 1 substrates (Table 1), Galβ1–3GalNAc-R. α6-Sialyltransferases III and IV (ST6GalNAc III and IV) act on sialylα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAc-R and do not require a peptide backbone in the substrate. These enzymes are distinct from the α6-sialyltransferases acting on the Gal-termini of N-glycans [19,117]. An α6-sialyltransferase from pig submaxillary gland, probably α6-sialyltransferase I, has been highly purified [140] and synthesizes the sialyl-Tn antigen structure. All of the α6-sialyltransferases are encoded on several exons.

Several possible mechanisms, listed below, can lead to a sialyl-Tn antigen expression in cancer (Fig. 3). (1) Enzyme relocalization: if polypeptide  
α-GalNAc-transferase is present in later Golgi compartments, the synthesis of core structures may no longer be possible. Alternatively, the α6-sialyltransferase may be localized to early compartments, and its action would block the synthesis of core structures. (2) Block in core synthesis: human colon cancer cells LSC have a block in O-glycan core 1 and 3 synthesis and cannot make the core structures 1–4. Therefore GalNAc is available for sialyl-Tn synthesis. (3) Loss of O-acetylation: in the normal colon, sialic acids of mucins are largely O-acetylated. In colon cancer, the degree of O-acetylation decreases, leading to the exposure of free sialic acid and recognition of the sialyl-Tn antigen by antibodies.

O-Acetylation of sialic acids is common in mucins, and is developmentally regulated [141]. This modification is thought to protect carbohydrate chains or the underlying peptides from degradation by intestinal bacteria. The O-acetyl group is added to sialic acid from acetyl-CoA by the action of O-acetyltransferase. In melanoma and other cells, this reaction occurs in the Golgi [142,143]. O-Acetyltransferases also appear to exist as a family of enzymes with

various specificities for the sialic acid linkages [144, 145]. cDNAs have been isolated from a human melanoma cDNA library that may encode proteins responsible for the 9-O-acetylation of α2-6- or α2-8-linked sialic acids [145]. O-Acetylated sialic acids are usually not recognized by antibodies directed against sialylated antigens, such as sialyl-Tn, sialyl-Le<sup>a</sup> or sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup>. Alteration in the activity of O-acetyltransferase in cancer is therefore one of the mechanisms controlling the expression of sialylated antigens.

### 6.2. Blood group and Lewis antigens

O-Glycans, especially those of mucins, may carry blood group and tissue antigens (Table 2). In cancer,

the expression of ABO blood groups is often abnormal. The enzymes synthesizing Lewis type or blood group ABO antigens (Table 2) of O-glycans are probably the same as those assembling these antigens on glycolipids and N-glycans. The genes encoding blood group AB transferases, the A α3-GalNAc-transferase and B α3-Gal-transferase, and α2-, α3-and α3/4-Fuc-transferases have been cloned. The A and B transferases are highly homologous proteins and differ only by four specific amino acids, resulting in different nucleotide donor specificity [146–148]. DNA sequences have been identified that appear to be involved in transcriptional regulation of these genes in cancer cells [149].

                                 O-acetylation


Fig. 3. Biosynthesis of truncated O-glycans in cancer cells. Several mechanisms have been proposed that lead to a truncation of O-glycan chains in cancer cells. Polypeptide α-GalNAc-transferase and α6-sialyltransferase may actively synthesize the sialyl-Tn antigen, SAα6GalNAc-. Chain growth would then be terminated, but O-acetylation can still occur. A reduction of O-acetylation in cancer exposes the unmodified sialyl-Tn antigen. The expression of Tn and sialyl-Tn antigens may also occur as a result of a blockage of early O-glycosylation steps. For example, core 3 synthesis (path b) appears to be blocked in most cultured cancer cells, and is reduced in colon cancer tissue. If O-glycan core 1 synthesis is also blocked (path a), as seen in human colon cancer LSC cells, none of the main core structures (1–4) can be synthesized and Tn and sialyl-Tn antigens are expressed. The synthesis of core 2 (path c) is blocked in certain breast cancer cells. This eliminates branched and complex O-glycans and leads to the occurrence of truncated chains. SA, sialyl.

is also dependent on the presence of the precursor structures. α2-Fuc-transferases synthesizing the blood group (O) H determinant, the precursor structure for blood group A and B, occur in secretory tissues where they glycosylate mucins and glycoproteins [150], and in hematopoietic cells where they act on cell surface, mucin-like and other glycoproteins [151, 152]. The secretory (FucT II) and hematopoietic types (FucT I) of α2-Fuc-transferase differ not only in their cell-specific expression, but also in their specificities towards Gal-terminated acceptors. The secretory type α2-Fuc-transferase (FucT II) has a distinct preference for the Gal residue of core 1 structures, and acts also on Gal β1–3 (sialyl α2–6) GalNAc- substrates. The synthesis of the H antigen is thought to compete with the addition of other terminal sugars. For example, the synthesis of core 2 is inhibited (Fig. 1) by the addition of Fucα1–2 to Gal of core 1. The α2-Fuc-transferase cannot act on α1–4-fucosylated structures, thus Lewis<sup>b</sup> structures (Table 2) are formed by the addition of Fucα1–4 to Fucα1–2Galβ1–3 GlcNAc- termini. A third type of α2-Fuc-transferase (RFT-III) was discovered in rabbit tissues; this enzyme has the characteristics of a secretory type enzyme, and acts preferably on Galβ1–3GalNAc/GlcNAc substrate structures [153]. Rat hepatoma also contains a secretory type α2-Fuc-transferase and acts preferably on glycolipids [154]. These novel types of enzymes may be altered in some cancers [155].

The overexpression of α2-Fuc-transferase in mice leads to a derangement of O-glycosylation pathways. Transgenic mice produce higher amounts of the H-antigen on their glycoproteins, less α3-linked sialic acids and less α3-Gal determinants, while sialyl-Tn expression is increased [156, 157]. Transfection of blood group H α2-Fuc-transferase into rat colon carcinoma REGb cells, renders the cells more aggressive and tumorigenic [158].

The α3-Fuc-transferases represent a family of enzymes (α3-Fuc-transferases III–VII) acting on internal GlcNAc residues with slightly different substrate specificities [159–165]. These enzymes are responsible for the synthesis of Lewis determinants in various cell types [18] and are expressed in a tissue- and development-specific fashion. α3-Fuc-transferase III has an unusual dual enzyme activity since it can synthesize both Fucα1–3GlcNAc and Fucα1–4GlcNAc linkages [166]. It appears that Fuc-transferases IV and VII, expressed in myeloid cells, are particularly involved in the synthesis of sialyl- and/or sulfo-Le<sup>x</sup> ligands for selectins [160, 167–169]. Fuc-transferase VII knock out mice are severely deficient in leukocyte rolling and neutrophil mobilization [168], and leukocytes from these mice do not bind selectins. This indicates that Fuc-transferase VII plays a major role in leukocyte trafficking. Many human tumors have altered α3-Fuc-transferase activity and mRNA levels. It remains to be shown which of these enzymes are involved in the synthesis of selectin ligands in cancer cells and their attachment to the endothelium or if they have other functions.

### 6.3. O-Glycan sulfation

Mucin O-glycans may carry sulfate esters, mainly at the 3-hydroxyl of Gal and the 6-hydroxyl of GlcNAc. The O-glycans of mucin from the human colon cancer cell line LS174T-HM7 have Le<sup>x</sup> determinants attached to core 2 structures, many of which carry sulfate esters on the 3-position of the terminal Gal residues [170]. Sulfation of O-glycans plays a role in cell adhesion and bacterial binding, and in the regulation of biosynthetic pathways [22, 171–173]. Sulfation of O-glycan core 1 prevents the branching reaction to form core 2 [174]; however, a Galβ1–4 residue can be transferred to GlcNAc after 6-sulfation. Sulfotransferase activities acting on the 6-position of GlcNAc [175] or the 3-position of Gal residues [174, 176] of glycoproteins or oligosaccharides have been described. Recently, sulfotransferases have been cloned that may be involved in the synthesis of sulfated selectin ligands. A mouse cDNA was isolated that encodes a sulfotransferase acting on the 6-position of terminal GlcNAc residues while internal GlcNAc residues are poor acceptors. The enzyme is expressed in several tissues including brain and high endothelial venules of lymph nodes. It has sequence similarity to chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase [177]. The cDNA of another sulfotransferase with consensus sequences of chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase was cloned from human fetal brain [178]. This enzyme acts on keratan sulfate chains by transferring sulfate to the 6-position of Gal resi-

dues. Since the enzyme acts on sialyl-N-acetyllactosamines it is possible that it also transfers sulfate to glycoprotein glycans.

Sulfotransferase activities as well as mucin sulfation may change in cancer. A decrease in sulfomucin expression is observed in colon cancer [179], and in an in vitro model of progression from polyposis to colon cancer [64]. This decrease of mucin sulfation is associated with decreased 3-Gal sulfotransferase activity [64, 66]. The same sulfotransferase activity is very low in several human breast cancer cell lines, in contrast to normal mammary cells [75].

### 7. Cancer of the gastro-intestinal tract

The characteristic changes in cancer are exemplified in intestinal cancer. Mucins from patients with intestinal cancer have less total carbohydrate and less sulfation, and *O*-glycans are truncated and sialylated. The carbohydrate reduction may be due to both shorter chain length and fewer *O*-glycan chains. Structural and antigenic properties of glycoproteins may be changed in cancer. For example, the expression of Tn, sialyl-Tn and T and Lewis antigens is often increased. This expression is tissue specific and differs along sections of the intestines and along the colonic crypts. Transitional mucosa may exhibit intermediate, mixed normal and cancerous antigen expression [180].

T and Tn mucin antigens often occur in advanced stage tumors. In intestinal and gastric tumors, sialyl-Tn and Tn expression appears to be a marker for poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas and mucinous carcinomas, and is associated with invasive and high proliferative properties of the tumors, metastasis and a poor clinical outcome [181–183]. These cancer-associated antigens therefore are useful for a prognosis and to evaluate the choice of treatment.

Mucins are degraded in the colon, and sialic acid modifications can be removed by intestinal enzymes [184]. While in normal mucins sialic acid residues may be masked by extensive modification by *O*-acetyl groups [143], the degree of *O*-acetylation may be reduced in advanced intestinal tumors [185]. Thus antibodies directed against sialic acid-containing epitopes react preferably with cancer mucins [141, 186, 187].

The enzymes synthesizing the four common core structures 1–4 are active in normal colon as well as in colon cancer tissue [66]. The increased expression of the T antigen in colon cancer tissue [188] may be due to decreased activity of the β3-GlcNAc-transferase synthesizing core 3 structures [66, 83]. This decrease in core 3 synthesis would favor core 1 synthesis by core 1 β3-Gal-transferase since both enzymes compete for GalNAc-terminating substrates. Increased activities of α3-sialyltransferase (O) and α2-Fuc-transferase synthesizing the H-antigen have also been found in colon cancer [66, 189], and the mRNA levels for α3-sialyltransferase (O) [190] as well as for α2-Fuc-transferase [191] are significantly increased in colon cancer tissue. These enzymes may mask the T antigen by substituting core 1, and may thus prevent a conversion to more complex core 2 structures.

In a study of normal and cancerous colon tissue using RT-PCR, it was found that the expression of α3-Fuc-transferase IV and α3-sialyltransferase with a preference for glycolipids (ST3Gal II) is upregulated in all colon cancer samples [192]. Other glycosyltransferases may also be up-regulated, e.g. β4-Gal-transferase and core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase. It is possible, but remains to be shown, that the up-regulation of core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase L is counterbalanced by a down-regulation of core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase M synthesizing cores 2 and 4. This would result in a net decrease in core 2 synthesis, and a significant loss of core 4 synthesis, as seen in a model of colon cancer [64]. In fact, total core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase activity is slightly lower in colon cancer, compared to normal colonic mucosa, and there is less core 4 synthesis and GlcNAcβ1–6 branching to form the I antigen. The mRNA for core 2 β6-GlcNAc-transferase (L) has been detected in colon cancer, but not in normal mucosa, and has been correlated with vessel invasion [193]. The L enzyme may thus be induced in cancer, while the M enzyme may be suppressed in cancer.

Since the blood group H determinant is the precursor structure for the ABO blood group synthesis, the α2-Fuc-transferase synthesizing the H determinant is an important factor regulating blood group ABO expression. ABO determinants are frequently changed in cancer, and there may be inappropriate expression of blood group antigens. For example,

blood group A may be expressed in individuals with blood group O [194]. The expression of blood group antigens, as well as of the enzymes involved in their synthesis, is often region- and cell type-specific [2]. A net loss of ABH expression has been found in the proximal cancerous colon, while the distal cancerous colon shows increased expression, compared to antigen patterns in normal tissue. Loss of blood group A in cancer can be related to reduced survival. Blood group A and B transferases [146] have been found either increased, reduced or aberrantly expressed in cancer tissue. Transfection of human colonic and gastric cancer cells with A and B transferase genes resulted in the expression of the corresponding blood groups and abolition of the H-antigen [195]. The A and B expressing cells showed considerably lower motility in culture suggesting that the expression of A and B antigens may regulate the motility and thus invasiveness of tumors.

Mucins and other glycoproteins produced by colon cancer tissue often express terminal, internal and extended Lewis and sialyl-Lewis antigens, including Le<sup>y</sup>, Le<sup>x</sup> and Le<sup>a</sup> (Table 2) [196]. It has been shown that sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> on cancer cells binds to endothelial cells through E-selectin [197–199]. This interaction has therefore been proposed as a factor in the attachment of cancer cells to the endothelium, and in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. The occurrence of the sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> epitope in colon cancer patients is associated with poor survival [200].

Cancerous gastric mucosa also aberrantly expresses Lewis antigens. By using anti-Lewis enzyme (α3/4-Fuc-transferase III) and anti-Le<sup>a</sup> antibody staining, it was shown that the expression of the Le<sup>a</sup> antigen in individuals possessing the Lewis gene correlated with the expression of the Lewis enzyme in metaplastic tissue. The staining intensity was much lower in normal gastric tissue [201].

The appearance of Lewis antigens is regulated by the tissue- and cancer-specific expression of various members of the α3-Fuc-transferase family. Treatment of cells with cDNA for α3-Fuc-transferase in the antisense direction abolished the expression of the sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> antigen. The mRNA level for α3-Fuc-transferases IV has been shown to be significantly increased in colon cancer tissue while mRNA for α3-Fuc-transferases III and VI remain unchanged [190,202]. However, it has been difficult

to correlate Lewis antigen and Fuc-transferase expression in tumor tissue. In contrast, there is a good correlation between sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> and α3-Fuc-transferase III expression in human colon cancer HT-29 cells [202].

Synthesis of underlying structures controls the sites for Lewis antigen attachment. O-Glycan core 2 is particularly important in providing a branch which carries selectin ligands [73]. The sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> structures of colon cancer cells CX-1.1 [203] are mainly attached to O-glycans as shown by beta elimination and by treatment with sialoprotease, an enzyme that cleaves peptide near sialylated O-glycosylation sites.

Human colorectal polyps tend to develop into carcinomas. Benign polyps may exhibit changed carbohydrate and altered glycosyltransferase activities that are reminiscent of cancer [204], and a great number of polyps express the truncated O-glycans, T and Tn antigens [205]. The progression to colonic adenocarcinoma and cancer tissue is associated with increased activity and mRNA levels of α2-Fuc-transferase [191]. The increase in sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> as well as extended Le<sup>y</sup> and Le<sup>x</sup> antigens during the development to cancer may correlate with the malignant potential of polyps [206,207].

Clonogenic and tumorigenic cell lines were developed as a model for the progression from polyposis to cancer [208]. The tumorigenic cells exhibited decreases in sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> antigen expression, and a decrease in the activities synthesizing core 2 and 4, the I antigen, and the sialyl-Tn antigen. Sulfation of mucins secreted from the tumorigenic cells was also decreased, and this correlated well with a decrease in Gal 3-sulfotransferase activity and possibly other sulfotransferases [64]. Sulfated epitopes of mucins are less abundant in colonic cancer, and instead, sialyl-mucins are produced [179]. This switch from sulfated to sialylated mucins has also been observed in other types of cancer [209,210]. However, the significance of the loss of sulfation is not known.

### 8. Pancreatic cancer

The pancreas produces high amounts of cell surface mucin MUC1, which possesses abnormal antigenicity in pancreatic cancer. MUC1 may be cleaved

from the cell surface, and is found in the serum and other body fluids of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma [211]. As a consequence, patients make antibodies against MUC1 epitopes [7]. The expression of mucin genes MUC1 to MUC5 is cell type specific and often altered during neoplastic transformation. In pancreatic cancer tissue, particularly MUC1, MUC3, MUC4, MUC5B and MUC5AC are expressed [212].

Pancreatic hyperplastic and cancer tissues express Le<sup>x</sup> antigens, while normal pancreatic tissues often express Le<sup>y</sup> [213]. Poorly differentiated cancers may exhibit a low Le<sup>x</sup> expression. Since the expression of Lewis antigens is usually associated with MUC1 [214] these antigens appear to be primarily attached to O-glycans. The cell surface expression of Lewis antigens can be inhibited by treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with the O-glycan extension inhibitor GalNAca-benzyl, but not with tunicamycin. This inhibition of O-glycan extension exposes MUC1 tandem repeat peptide epitopes. The Lewis antigens of cancer MUC1 may be responsible for binding to endothelium, since mucins secreted from pancreatic cancer cells and patient's sera inhibit binding of pancreatic tumor cells to E-selectin [215].

Transcripts of the secretor gene and hematopoietic type of α2-Fuc-transferases are expressed in normal pancreatic tissue and in pancreatic cancer as well as cancer cell lines. The activity of α2-Fuc-transferase was found to be decreased in tumor tissues and cancer cell lines. Similarly, α3-Fuc-transferases III, IV, V and VII were expressed in these cell types. α3-Fuc-transferase VI transcript was only found in tumor tissues, but not in normal pancreatic tissues, although it is expressed in kidney and liver [216]. α4-Fuc-transferase activity was correlated with the cell surface expression of Le<sup>a</sup>, sialyl-Le<sup>a</sup> and Le<sup>y</sup> on cancer cell lines. However, there was no obvious correlation between α3-Fuc-transferase activity and sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> expression.

shown to target MUC1 mucin core peptides [217] and can lyse B-cell lines expressing either MUC1 or MUC1 peptides from the tandem repeat region. Lysis is inhibited by antibodies directed against the MUC1 tandem repeat region peptide. Several other glycoprotein antigens appear in ovarian cancer, but usually also in other types of cancers. CA125 is a mucin-like glycoprotein tumor marker that appears in most epithelial ovarian cancers, but may also be present in benign ovarian disease or endometriosis. Using a monoclonal antibody, CA125 was isolated from OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells, and shown to be rich in O-glycans with core 2 structures and Le<sup>x</sup> and Le<sup>y</sup> determinants [218].

Sialyl-Tn and Tn antigens are highly expressed in ovarian tumors and this seems to be an early event during carcinogenesis [219]. Mucins expressing the sialyl-Tn antigen may be secreted from the tumor and appear in the blood. The occurrence of the sialyl-Tn antigen in the serum of ovarian cancer patients is associated with a poor prognosis [220].

The expression of ABH and Lewis antigens on the surface epithelium of the endometrium depends on the blood group and secretor status and the menstrual cycle, and is hormonally regulated [221]. Le<sup>b</sup> antigen is prominent in endometrial cells [222]. The α2-, α3- and α4-Fuc-transferase activities synthesizing these antigens are increased in uterine endometrial cancer, compared to the activities in normal endometrial tissue. Endometrial cells in culture also exhibit high levels of α2- and α4-Fuc-transferase activities.

A number of glycoproteins, including haptoglobin and α1-proteinase inhibitor, are abnormally glycosylated in ovarian cancer. Haptoglobin contains more Fuc residues in patients with ovarian cancer, and this corresponds to higher activities of α2-, α3- and particularly α4-Fuc-transferase activities in ovarian cancer tissue [223, 224]. α2-Fuc-transferase activity increases during tumorigenesis, and is high in choriocarcinoma compared to normal placental tissue, and in choriocarcinoma cells JEG-3 and BeWo [225].

Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone produced in the placenta of pregnant women and carries N- and O-glycans. In patients with choriocarcinoma, urinary hCG carries mainly O-glycan chains with core 2 structures. This is in contrast to normal hCG which has been shown

MUC1 mucin antigenicity is altered in ovarian cancer, and anti-MUC1 antibodies can be used as a diagnostic tool for the detection of cancer. Cytotoxic T-cells from ovarian malignant tumors have been

by A. Kobata and his coworkers to have mainly O-
glycan core 1 and only about 10% core 2 structures,
while hCG from invasive moles has intermediate lev-
els [226]. It is thus possible that core 2 β6-GlcNAc-
transferase is activated in choriocarcinoma tissue.

### 10. Prostate and urinary tract cancer

Adenocarcinomas from the prostate produce glyco-
proteins that may be abnormal in amounts and in
structure. Potential markers for the disease include
ABO blood groups and Lewis antigens (Table 2).
Sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> expression is associated with hormone-re-
sistant, aggressive disease and a poor prognosis [227],
and may indicate a potential for metastatic prostate
cancer. Invasive urothelium expresses Le<sup>x</sup> and Le<sup>y</sup>
antigens, correlating with high activities of α3- and
α4-Fuc-transferases [228].

In cancer tissue of the urothelium, the expression
of T-, Tn- and Lewis antigens is often altered. In
addition, bladder cancer may be associated with
changes of ABO antigens and a loss of blood group
A and B transferase activities [229, 230]. The mRNA
levels for the blood group ABO transferases appear
to correlate with the blood group expression, and are
high in normal bladder tissue, but low in bladder
tumor tissues [231].

### 11. Lung cancer

Cancer tissue as well as sera from patients with
lung cancer exhibit many of the blood group epi-
topes characteristic of cancer [232]. ABO blood
group determinants may be lost or appear as incom-
patible AB blood groups [233]. The loss of blood
groups and a high expression of the H determinant
suggests tumor invasiveness and a poor survival [234]
while the presence of blood group A can be corre-
lated with survival of patients with bronchial cancer
[235].

Lewis epitopes are normally expressed in a stage
specific manner in the lung [236]. Similar to findings
in colon, prostate, endometrial and ovarian tumors,
the α3-Fuc-transferase activities synthesizing the Le<sup>x</sup>/
Le<sup>y</sup> epitopes are significantly increased in sera of
lung cancer patients [237]. Correspondingly, in-

creases in Le<sup>x</sup>, Le<sup>y</sup> antigens, their sialylated deriva-
tives, and multimeric Le<sup>x</sup> have been found [232]. Sial-
yl-Le<sup>x</sup> expression was correlated with α3-Fuc-
transferase VII mRNA levels, while the survival of
patients was shorter when either α3-Fuc-transferase
IV or VII, or both were expressed [238, 239].

### 12. Breast cancer

Breast carcinomas may exhibit altered expression
of membrane bound and secreted mucins, including
MUC1 and MUC2 [240]. The epithelial cell surface
mucin MUC1 is abnormally glycosylated and its
expression is upregulated in breast cancer [241]. As
a consequence, new epitopes are exposed leading
to humoral and cell mediated immune responses
[242, 243]. The cancer-associated peptide epitopes
have been exploited as immunogens for cancer
[7, 244].

In normal mammary cell MUC1 O-glycan chains
are predominantly of the branched and bulky core 2
structure. Compared to MUC1 from transformed
mammary cells isolated from normal milk [129],
breast cancer MUC1 contains less total carbohydrate
and GlcNAc, but more sialic acid; chains are of
core 1 structure and often lack the core 2 structure.
This leads to a significant reduction in chain length
and overall size and to the exposure of normally
masked peptide epitopes. The mechanisms of these
changes involve the turn-off of core 2 β6-GlcNAc-
transferase L in BT20 and T47D breast cancer cells,
as well as an increase in α3-sialyltransferase activity
[75]. In MCF-7 cells, these two enzymes are both
active. Since they colocalize in the Golgi, they com-
pete for the common core substrate. An increased
sialyltransferase activity prevents the branching reac-
tion to form core 2, and chains will thus remain
sialylated and are not branched and elongated. The
exposure of MUC1 peptide epitopes can also be in-
duced by treatment of normal mammary cells with
GalNAc-benzyl [75]. This indicates that the trunca-
tion of O-glycans is indeed responsible for the can-
cer-associated appearance of mucin epitopes.

ABO blood group determinants, Lewis and T and
Tn antigens may be altered in breast cancer [188]. As
in many other tumors, O-glycan chains attached to
MUC1 cell surface mucin and other glycoproteins

may be truncated. As a consequence, T, Tn and sialyl-Tn antigens have been found in breast cancers with lymph node metastases [245]. In the early stages of breast cancer, the backbone structures of glycoproteins are often of the type 1 chain, Galβ1-3GlcNAc-. The occurrence of this structure is reduced in disease-free intervals and may be useful as a prognostic marker for breast cancer [246].

Abnormal fucosylation is also found in breast cancer. Many breast tumors have lost the expression of the Le<sup>b</sup> antigen, and this correlates with the degree of malignancy and invasiveness [247]. There may be increased α3-fucosylation, since serum α3-Fuc-transferase levels and abnormally fucosylated haptoglobin increase in breast cancer. This increase is normalized upon positive response to therapy [224]. Sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> was found to be increased in breast cancer tissues [248]. RNA analysis of tumors indicated that α3-Fuc-transferase VI expression correlates with the levels of sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup>. α3-Fuc-transferases V and VII were not expressed in breast tumors, and α3-Fuc-transferase III was only expressed in an isolated case. Transfection studies where the α3-Fuc-transferase VI gene was transfected into MCF-7 breast cancer cells showed that α3-Fuc-transferase VI is responsible for an enhancement of sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> expression.

and invasiveness, other O-glycan structures may also play important roles on cancer cell surfaces. Compared to primary tumors, the expression of Tn and T antigens is decreased in metastatic colon cancer cells, and a corresponding increase of sialyl-Tn, sialyl-T, sialyl-Le<sup>a</sup> and sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> has been observed. The tissue distribution of sialyl-Tn and Le<sup>y</sup> antigens differs significantly between primary tumors and metastases of cervical cancer [253]. GalNAc-benzyl treatment of B16 L6 melanoma cells increases peanut agglutinin binding, probably due to the exposure of the T antigen, and reduces sialylation of CD44 while enhancing the metastatic capacity [249].

In variants of human colon cancer cells KM12, the expression of sialyl-dimeric Le<sup>x</sup> attached to mucin-type chains corresponds to high invasiveness [254]. Sialyl-dimeric Le<sup>x</sup> is frequently increased in metastatic colon cancer [255]. These sialylated Lewis structures may play roles in cancer other than through their selectin binding properties. Sialic acid has repeatedly been implicated in the metastatic process [256–260]. Inhibition of sialylation [261], and O-glycan extension and sialylation [251, 262] reduces the metastatic potential of cancer cells. Metastatic colon cancer cells have been found to produce hypersialylated mucins [263] which appear to play an important role in cell adhesion. It is possible that chains carrying sialic acid may regulate the interaction of cancer cells with other cells and with the cell matrix. These chains may therefore be responsible for adhesion as well as anti-adhesion, and for extending the survival time of cancer cells in the bloodstream. Sialic acid may also be involved in growth regulation [264]. Because sialyl-glycoconjugates regulate adhesion and promote motility, they may be important for the colonization and metastatic potential of cancer cells [265–267].

### 13. Metastasis

The mutual interactions between tumor cells and endothelial cells, the attachment and invasion of tumor cells through the endothelium via binding of selectins to their ligands may be an important step in the metastatic process. Tumor cells with mucin type O-glycans and sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> ligands readily bind to E-selectins on activated endothelium [114]. In several models of metastasis, it has been shown that O-glycans are critical for the formation of metastases [249, 250]. Inhibition of O-glycan extension by GalNAc-benzyl prevents this binding of human colon cancer cells to E-selectin, and reduces liver metastases of human cancer cells LS174T in nude mice [251]. Since the expression of Lewis antigens could be inhibited with GalNAc-benzyl, these appear to be mainly attached to O-glycans [252]. While sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> attached to O-glycans may promote cell adhesion
