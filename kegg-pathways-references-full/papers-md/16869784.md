Ras proteins play a direct causal role in human cancer and in other diseases. Mutant H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras occur in varying frequencies in different tumor types, for reasons that are not known. Other members of the Ras superfamily may also
and N-Ras are viable (Esteban et al. 2001), whereas mice lacking K-Ras are not (Johnson et al. 1997). However, we have found that all three Ras proteins are usually expressed within the same cell, at approximately the same level, suggesting that the three Ras proteins may have different functions which may be selected for during tumorigenesis in a tissue-specific fashion.

The first half of H-, K-, and N-Ras, which includes the switch 1 and 2 domains that are involved in interaction with effectors, are identical. Consistent with this, we have not

a better understanding of the many effector pathways regulated by Ras and its closely related GTPases will likely

CANCER GENETICS AND RAS EFFECTORS

Until recently, the PI3'K pathway appeared to be the
more critical Ras effector pathway in human cancer,
based on the observation that mutations occur frequently in major regulators of this pathway

possessed PIK3CA mutations, suggesting that coexistence of PTEN/PIK3CA mutations could occur in other tumors as well (Oda et al. 2005).

Coexistence of mutations in both PTEN and PIK3CA may imply that more than one input activating the PI3K/Akt pathway is required to completely activate this pathway in endometrial cancers, but not in melanoma. In breast carcinoma, PIK3

clinical trials were initiated in which Nexavar was tested in patients suffering from malignant melanoma. To date, little clinical activity has been observed as a single agent, however, even though the drug appeared to hit the target effectively, i.e., MEK phosphorylation was blocked significantly. Lack of efficacy could be because (1) late-stage melanomas may no longer be Raf-dependent; (2) Raf inhibition causes growth arrest, but not apoptosis; or (3
# TARGETS IN THE Ras PATHWAY

## CONCLUSIONS

Ras proteins and their downstream effectors play direct causal roles in human cancer. Analysis of mutations in these pathways reveals that the MAPK pathway and the PI3K pathways are activated frequently in cancers, in addition to K-Ras, and, to a lesser degree, N-Ras and H-Ras. To date, only one drug (Nexavar) targeting the Ras pathway has been approved for cancer treatment, but a number of others are under development. The clinical value of targeting these pathways remains unclear, since Nexavar was approved for treatment of renal cell cancer based, most
