Abstract:

Heart failure (HF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) confer considerable burden on the healthcare system. Although these often occur together, DM can increase HF risk, while HF can accelerate DM complications. HF is a clinical syndrome resulting from systolic and/or diastolic impairment caused by ischemic, non-ischemic (e.g., DM) or other etiologies. HF exists along a spectrum, from stage A (i.e., at-risk DM persons) to stage D (i.e., refractory HF from end-stage DM cardiomyopathy (DMCM)). HF is further categorized by reduced, midrange and preserved ejection fraction (EF). In type 2 DM, the most prevalent form of DM, several pathophysiological mechanisms (e.g., insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, etc.) can contribute to myocardial damage leading to DMCM. HF and DM management and patient outcomes are guided by EF and drug efficacy. In this review, we focus on the interplay between HF and DM on disease pathophysiology, management, and patient outcomes. Specifically, we highlight the role of novel anti-hyperglycemic (e.g., sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors) and HF therapies (e.g., renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors) on HF outcomes in DM and HF patients.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) confer considerable burden on the healthcare system. Global HF and DM prevalence exceeds 26 million and 463 million, respectively. In Canada, HF and DM prevalence is respectively over 600,000 and 2.3 million, with a corresponding annual HF and DM incidence exceeding 50,000 and 200,000 people.[1-3] Along with an aging Canadian population, these comorbidities remain a growing epidemic associated with an annual burden of over $2.8 billion HF- and $17 billion DM-related costs on the healthcare system.[1-3] HF and DM often occur together, thus exacerbating each condition and worsening patient outcomes, thereby increasing healthcare costs. A cost-of-illness HF studies meta-analysis reported higher healthcare costs associated with HF management in the presence of DM and other cardiovascular (CV) risk factors.[4] The impact of these conditions upon morbidity and mortality cannot be overestimated! It is imperative to understand how these conditions intersect in terms of disease pathophysiology and management to improve HF outcomes in DM and HF patients.

Defining Heart Failure

HF is a clinical syndrome resulting from a number of etiologies, including ischemic, non-ischemic (e.g., DM), and other causes.[5] It is characterized by the presence of systemic or pulmonary congestion and/or low cardiac output related to impaired ventricular function and/or filling.[5] While HF symptom severity can be defined by the New York Heart Association functional classification system, HF is staged along a spectrum, as stage A (i.e., at-risk DM persons), stage B (i.e., DM cardiomyopathy (DMCM) without HF), stage C (i.e., DMCM with HF), and stage D (i.e., refractory HF from end-stage DMCM).[5] HF can be further categorized

by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), as reduced (HFrEF, LVEF ≤40%), midrange

(HFmEF, LVEF 41-49%), or preserved (HFpEF, LVEF ≥50%). [5] Table 1 highlights these HF

categories, by associated comorbidities, cause of death, management strategies, and DMCM

features. Whereas HFpEF has a higher proportion of non-CV causes of death than HFrEF or

HFmEF, HF hospitalization (HFH) occurs regardless of LVEF or HF etiology. More

comprehensive reviews on HF are highlighted elsewhere. [5]

Take-Home Points:

- HF is a clinical syndrome classified by symptomatology, stage, and LVEF
- HFpEF has a higher proportion of non-CV causes of death than HFrEF or HFmEF

Insulin Resistance, Diabetes Mellitus, and Diabetic Cardiomyopathy

Multiple forms of DM exists, but type 2DM (T2DM) accounts for >90% of cases. [2, 3]

T2DM commonly presents in adulthood, and late-stage disease is characterized by insulin

resistance of peripheral tissues such as muscle and liver, and concomitant insulin deficiency from

pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. [2, 3, 6] Insulin resistance is a pathological state in which tissues

do not respond to normal circulating insulin levels. Ensuing hyperglycemia (glucotoxicity) and

elevated free fatty acids (FFAs; lipotoxicity) contributes to impaired insulin secretion,

exacerbating insulin resistance. [6] Along with muscle, liver, and pancreatic beta-cells, insulin

resistance in other tissues contributes to the pathogenesis of T2DM: fat (accelerated lipolysis),

kidney (increased glucose reabsorption), gastrointestinal tract (reduced insulin secretion from

low circulating incretin levels or activity), brain (neurotransmitter dysregulation, affecting satiety

and weight gain), and pancreatic alpha-cells (hyperglucagonemia). [6] Such pathophysiologic

perturbations lead to microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) and macrovascular

116 (accelerated atherosclerosis) complications, which eventually lead to structural heart changes
117 associated with ischemic or non-ischemic HF in T2DM patients.[6] Neurohormonal activation
118 and the cross-talk between worsening HF and renal dysfunction alters metabolism and
119 hemodynamics, further exacerbating obesity and insulin resistance in this vicious cycle (Figure
120 1).
121 DMCM, first reported in 1954, is characterized by subclinical cardiac fibrosis and
122 concentric LV hypertrophy (LVH) leading to early-onset diastolic dysfunction and a dilated left
123 atrium; and preserved or reduced LV systolic function, in the absence of epicardial coronary
124 atherosclerosis, hypertension (HTN), valvular or other structural heart disease.[7] Several
125 mechanisms (Figure 2) play a role in the pathogenesis of DMCM, including impaired insulin
126 and other signaling pathways, glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and abnormal endoplasmic reticulum
127 stress.[7-10] These mechanisms underlie myocyte apoptosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and
128 excessive extracellular matrix production, key features of the “diabetic heart”.[8, 11] Endothelial
129 and contractile dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress exacerbate diastolic dysfunction,
130 and myocyte apoptosis.[12] HF with DM potentiates these pathophysiological changes,
131 worsening cardiac contractility ultimately leading to structural myocardial changes.
132 One unifying hypothesis as to how T2DM can lead to DMCM with HFrEF and HFpEF
133 centres on cardiac remodeling driven by phenotype-specific mechanisms.[13] In DM patients,
134 cardiomegaly and clinical HF were consistent with a dilated HFrEF phenotype, [14] characterized
135 by sarcomeric loss and replacement collagen fibrosis, plus markedly elevated NT-proBNP
136 levels.[13] The restrictive HFpEF phenotype is characterized by hypertrophied cardiomyocytes
137 and reactive collagen fibrosis, with mildly elevated NT-proBNP and more often atrial
138 fibrillation.[13] Autoimmunity contributes to the dilated HFrEF phenotype, whereas insulin

139 resistance, hyperglycemia, and lipotoxicity contributes to a greater extent to the restrictive
140 HFpEF phenotype.[13] Both are influenced by advanced glycation end-product (AGE)
141 deposition, inflammation and microvascular rarefaction (reduced capillary to cardiomyocyte
142 surface area).[13] Despite such characteristic findings, diagnosing DMCM remains challenging.
143 While other structural heart disease can be excluded with coronary angiogram, blood pressure
144 monitoring, cardiac imaging or endomyocardial biopsy, mimickers of HF be ruled out as
145 potential confounders (Table 1).[15]
146 Take-Home Points:
147 - The “ominous octet” contributes to the T2DM pathophysiology
148 - Cardinal features of DMCM, independent of EF, include diastolic dysfunction,
149 concentric LVH, dilated left atrium, and interstitial fibrosis
150 - DMCM remains a challenging diagnosis in the absence of coronary atherosclerosis
151 and other comorbidities, and is characterized by dilated HFrEF and restrictive
152 HFpEF phenotypes

154 Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin Resistance and the Interplay with Heart Failure
155 Several clinical studies indicate that T2DM begets HF and vice-versa.[16] There is a
156 baseline presence of HF in 11.8% of DM, with a higher age-related HF incidence.[17] HF is a
157 common adverse CV event in T2DM patients.[18] Conversely, >10% of HF patients go on to
158 develop new-onset DM, which rises with HF duration and severity.[19] The risk of T2DM was
159 18-22% higher in HF patients, while a 2 to 5-fold greater risk of developing HF was noted in
160 DM subjects.[17] After adjusting for CV risk factors, the incidence of new-onset HF increased
161 by factors of two (men) to five (women) with DM relative to age-matched controls in the

162 Framingham Heart Study.[20] Similarly, DM increased HF risk independent of coronary
163 atherosclerosis by 1.7-fold in the Cardiovascular Health Study of 5,888 elderly subjects.
164 Moreover, 44% of patients with HFH from the GWTG-HF registry had DM.[21] After excluding
165 ischemic heart disease, a case-control study of 104,395 patients reported a strong association
166 between DM and idiopathic dilated CM.[22] Recently, the EVITA registry revealed higher
167 composite mortality or readmission and other CV events in DM vs non-DM patients (all
168 p<0.001).[23] NYHA III/IV HF was more prevalent in DM subjects (odds ratio 1.54,
169 p<0.001).[23] These findings emphasize that DM can influence HF risk, severity, and outcomes.
170 Risk factors for HF such as coronary artery disease (CAD), CKD, HTN and obesity
171 frequently co-exist in T2DM patients, and can accelerate LV remodeling or dysfunction in these
172 patients.[24] LV mass and wall thickness were notably increased in DM patients.[20] DM also
173 markedly increased HF incidence (hazard ratio (HR) 3.3) in stable CAD patients, whereas
174 myocardial glucose extraction (i.e., cardiac efficiency) was lower in the 35% of HF and multi-
175 vessel CAD patients who had DM compared to those without DM or HF.[25, 26] Of the 33,357
176 elderly patients in ALLHAT with CV risk factors, baseline DM had a 2-fold higher risk for HFH
177 or death.[27, 28] Further, DM was one of five independent predictors for HF (relative risk 2.9) in
178 the 10% of elderly subjects with de novo HF, and correlated with the progression of
179 asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction to HF, HFH and death.[29, 30] Ofstad et al summarized
180 the incremental risk of HFH analyzed by concomitant baseline DM or HF in dedicated HF (1.2
181 to 1.9-fold) or DM (2.2 to 4.3-fold) trials, respectively.[31] However, insulin resistance without
182 DM has also been implicated in HF development. In the UKPDS, HF risk increased by 16% for
183 each 1% increase in mean serum HbA1c levels (p=0.021).[32] In a prospective study of 31,546
184 DM subjects with end-organ damage or vascular disease, fasting hyperglycemia served as a

185 significant risk factor for HFH after adjusting for DM, HTN and prior MI.[33] In non-DM
186 patients, HFH occurred 1.2-fold more often in those with fasting hyperglycemia and high CV
187 risk, and 1.25-fold more often in those with elevated HbA1c levels but not HF.[33, 34] Finally,
188 in a study of 115,803 elderly Medicare patients, 5-year survival was lower in those with vs
189 without de novo HF (p<0.001).[35] Good glycemic control (HbA1c 7.1%) was associated with
190 the lowest risk of death in DM patients with HF, whereas a higher HbA1c was associated with
191 increased HF incidence.[35] These data highlight worse HF outcomes with poor glycemic
192 control or impaired glucose tolerance in patients regardless of frank DM.

193

194 Diabetic Cardiomyopathy and Heart Failure Phenotypes
195 Several studies highlight the prevalence of HFrEF and HFpEF phenotypes in DMCM and
196 impact on HF outcomes in DM patients. In one cross-sectional analysis of 581 elderly T2DM
197 patients, 28% had undiagnosed HF, 5% HFrEF and 23% HFpEF.[36] Further, 68% of patients
198 without inducible ischemia developed LV dysfunction within five years of an initial T2DM
199 diagnosis; 25% had combined, whereas 27% and 16% had isolated systolic and diastolic
200 dysfunction, respectively.[37] Older age, elevated fasting plasma glucose levels, and higher
201 HbA1c(all p<0.001) correlated with impaired LV diastolic dysfunction in T2DM patients.[37]
202 In the REACH registry, of 44,227 patients at risk or with atherothrombosis, 43.6% had DM.
203 These DM patients had a higher risk of HFH (HR 1.3), independent of CAD.[38] In 16.1% of
204 patients with HF and DM, there was an over 4.7-fold increase in HFH.[38] Whereas the
205 cumulative incidence of HF and HFH was higher in DM patients (both p<0.0001), [38] CV death
206 or HFH was higher in the DM cohorts with HFrEF vs HFpEF (HR 2 vs 1.6, both p<0.0001).[39]
207 Clinical trials reporting on DM patients with LVEF >40% (CHARM), >45% (DIG), and ≥50%

(RELAX and I-PRESERVE) found that DM worsened HF outcomes.[40, 41] In an analysis of

232,656 HFpEF patients from the GWTG-HF registry, DM correlated with greater 30-day

readmissions including HF (p<0.0001).[40] In a post-hoc analysis of TOPCAT in HFpEF

patients, the presence of microvascular complications of DM worsened CV outcomes including

first (HR 1.97, p<0.001) and recurrent (HR 1.78, p=0.0036) HFH.[42] Interestingly, the novel

machine learning-derived WATCH-DM HF risk score, derived from the ACCORD trial cohort

without HF and validated in the ALLHAT T2DM cohort, demonstrated significantly better

discrimination of 5-year incident risk for HFrEF vs HFpEF.[24] Future studies that include novel

machine learning algorithms are required to better evaluate the interplay between DM and HF,

especially on the basis of LVEF given the differing DMCM phenotypes and the limited data as it

relates to HFmEF.

Take-Home Points:

• DM can contribute to the development of HF and vice-versa

• DM worsens HFH to a greater degree in HFpEF than HFrEF

Anti-Hyperglycemic and Heart Failure Therapies: Impact on Heart Failure Outcomes

Medical management for T2DM and HF are guided by HbA1c levels, LVEF, and HF

stage or etiology. These have been extensively described by Diabetes Canada and the Canadian

Cardiovascular Society (CCS) HF guidelines.[2, 3, 43, 44] Specifically, the use of

thiazolidinediones (TZDs) is contraindicated in patients with HF and NYHA III/IV symptoms,

as studies of pioglitazone (PROactive: HR 1.4) and rosiglitazone (RECORD: HR 2.1) had shown

an increased risk of HFH or HF death.[45, 46] These studies prompted the discontinuation of

TZDs and the dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha and gamma agonists

231 for increased HF risk, and subsequent requirement for demonstration of CV drug safety of all  
232 novel glucose-lowering agents for approval.[47] We focus on the impact of these therapies  
233 primarily on HF outcomes in human studies (Supplemental Table S1).  

235 **Lifestyle Modification, Glycemic Control and Existing Anti-Hyperglycemic Agents (AHAs)**  

236 Poor glycemic control in DM patients is associated with worse HFH outcomes, even in  
237 those without HF. While insulin infusion improved LVEF more so in patients without than with  
238 DM, a meta-analysis of intensive glycemic control failed to impact HF risk (HR 1.02,  
239 p=0.26).[48, 49] The ORIGIN trial also reported neutrality for first (HR 0.90, p=0.19) and  
240 recurrent (HR 0.91, p=0.39) HFH.[50] This study randomized 12,537 patients with DM, glucose  
241 intolerance or impaired fasting glucose to insulin glargine vs standard non-insulin therapy, but  
242 excluded NYHA III/IV HF patients.[50] Lifestyle interventions (e.g., exercise training and  
243 reduced dietary caloric or alcohol consumption), and bariatric surgery where indicated,  
244 ameliorate insulin resistance and improve glycemic control.[43, 51] Data on their impact on HF  
245 outcomes in T2DM patients are limited, but improved quality of life scores, cardiorespiratory  
246 fitness, normalized diastolic dysfunction, and decreased LVH and CV outcomes such as HFH  
247 have been documented.[51-55]  

248 Metformin augments glucose uptake via glucose transporters (GLUT)-1 and 4 at the  
249 sarcolemma of insulin-resistant cardiomyocytes.[56] Metformin also reduces excess intracellular  
250 calcium that contributes to abnormal relaxation, maintains metabolic flexibility by increased  
251 glucose metabolism, and restores endothelial nitric oxide synthase function to overcome the  
252 effects of insulin resistance.[56] First-line metformin therapy has not been evaluated for efficacy  
253 in CV outcomes against placebo.[43] In a post-hoc analysis of the SAVOR-TIMI 53 study of  

254 T2DM patients, metformin was associated with a lower risk of CV death (HR 0.68) but not HFH,
255 and resulted in less all-cause mortality in those without than with baseline HF (HR 0.63,
256 p=0.001). [57] HF outcomes were not examined in the REACH registry where metformin
257 reduced CV mortality.[58] In a meta-analysis of 815,639 DM patients, metformin significantly
258 lowered all-cause mortality (HR 0.74); but some studies excluded HF patients.[57] In another
259 meta-analysis of DM patients with HF, metformin lowered CV mortality.[59] These findings
260 highlight the need for randomized studies to evaluate the efficacy of metformin in DM patients
261 with HF for HF outcomes.
262 Take-Home Points:
263 • Lifestyle interventions, bariatric surgery, insulin and metformin can improve insulin
264 resistance and glycemic control; their impact on HF outcomes requires further
265 exploration
266 
267 Incretins and SGLT2 Inhibitors
268 Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) mimetics or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i)
269 control hyperglycemia by enhancing myocardial glucose uptake via sarcolemmal GLUT-1 and 4
270 translocation, augmenting glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and suppressing glucagon
271 secretion.[56] GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) result in supra-physiological GLP-1 levels
272 with administration, while DPP-4i increase GLP-1 to physiological levels in response to an oral
273 glucose load.[56] When compared against placebo, other AHAs or canagliflozin, a meta-analysis
274 of 285,436 T2DM patients treated with GLP-1RAs reported neutrality for HFH (HR 0.94).[60]
275 Other meta-analyses examining for effects of GLP-1RAs in pooled analyses of multiple or
276 individual agents showed variability in HF events.[60] GLP-1 infusion mildly improved LV

277 dysfunction by +4.4% (p=0.005) in patients with NYHA III/IV HFrEF, along with exercise
278 tolerance, quality of life, and cardiac insulin sensitivity but not natriuretic peptides.[60] Other
279 studies of patients with HFrEF, ischemic heart disease, or T2DM showed a trend towards LVEF
280 improvement with intravenous GLP-1 infusion.[60] Liraglutide administration in patients with
281 DM and HFrEF (≤40 or 45%) or ischemic heart disease with HFpEF (>40%) did not consistently
282 improve LVEF.[60] Interestingly, in the LYDIA trial, liraglutide improved diastolic function in
283 young, obese T2DM patients, as measured by mitral valve filling parameters.[61] The FIGHT
284 study found a signal towards higher HFH (HR 1.30, p=0.17) and less clinical stability at 180
285 days post-discharge with sustained liraglutide in advanced HFrEF patients within 14 days of an
286 acute HFH, regardless of T2DM status.[62] These findings highlight the interaction of HF
287 history and severity on HF outcomes, underscoring the importance of tailored AHAs in such
288 patients based on their baseline risk profiles of DM, HF and CV disease.
289 In a nested case-control analysis of 29,741 of 1,499,650 patients with HFH, incretin-
290 based therapies exhibited neutrality in HF events compared with other oral AHAs, independent
291 of duration, in patients with or without HF (both p<0.05).[63] There appears to be a greater
292 variation in CV efficacy with regards to HFH and HF outcomes with DPP-4i, despite promising
293 preclinical data.[63-70] Meta-analyses of CV outcome trials of DPP-4i designed to include
294 T2DM patients with established CV disease were neutral, whereas those including observational
295 studies of patients with CV disease or vascular risk factors reported augmented HFH burden.[63]
296 However, this increased risk may be driven by saxagliptin alone, as opposed to other DPP4i.[63]
297 In cardiomyocytes, saxagliptin reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium levels and prolonged
298 action potential duration, thereby impairing contractile force and systolic function.[71] Notably,
299 saxagliptin (SAVOR-TIMI 53) raised clinical concerns with a 27% higher incidence of HFH

(3.5% vs 2.8%, p=0.007) independent of age and HbA1c levels, especially in those with baseline  
elevated natriuretic peptides and prior HF or CKD history.[72]  
Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) impact several physiological  
endpoints which favorably reduce HF risk and outcomes. SGLT2i reduce BP and body weight,  
and promote nephro-protection and osmotic diuresis.[73] These actions may directly improve  
arterial stiffness by decreasing sympathetic tone, and indirectly improve insulin sensitivity and  
beta-cell function.[73] Additional potential mechanisms may include improved oxygen delivery  
and better energy efficiency with the shift towards ketone bodies for fuel over FFA and glucose  
oxidation.[73] The EMPA-REG OUTCOME study demonstrated reduced first (HR 0.65,  
p=0.002) and recurrent HFH with empagliflozin.[74] While canagliflozin attenuated HFH in  
T2DM patients with prior HF and atherosclerosis or its risk factors, dapagliflozin did so  
regardless of HF status.[75-78] Canagliflozin had a greater reduction in HFH in patients with  
HFrEF and HFuEF (unknown) vs HFpEF, whereas dapagliflozin reduced HFH by 36% and 24%  
in those with or without LVEF <45%, respectively.[73] Recently, VERTIS CV showed a 30%  
reduction in HFH (HR 0.70, p=0.006) with ertugliflozin.[79] Composite CV death or HFH was  
also reduced by ertugliflozin (p=0.11), including in patients on diuretics (p=0.01) or DPP-4i  
(p=0.06), but interestingly not in those with prior HF (p=0.66).[79] Several meta-analyses of  
randomized studies showed lower CV events including HFH with SGLT2i vs placebo or other  
AHAs in T2DM patients with a low CV risk profile.[75, 80, 81] HFH reduction in these meta-  
analyses was robust (HR from 0.65-0.67) and significant (p-interaction from 0.002 to  
<0.001).[80] Findings from globally-conducted observational CVD-REAL studies confirm the  
generalizable SGLT2i class effect in T2DM patients for primary and secondary CV  
prevention.[80] Specifically, these studies reduced HFH favoring SGLT2i vs other AHAs (HR

323 from 0.61-0.70, and p-interaction < 0.0001 to 0.001).[80] In the EMPA-HEART study, indexed
324 LV mass regression was significantly greater with empagliflozin (-4.71g) relative to placebo (
325 0.39g) from baseline.[82] By contrast, in T2DM HFrEF patients, dapagliflozin did not
326 significantly alter LV volumes assessed by CMR in the REFORM study.[83] Other mechanistic
327 trials for SGLT2i are pending (Table 2), which will evaluate effects on exercise tolerance,
328 quality of life, natriuretic peptide levels, and prevention of CV, HF and renal outcomes across a
329 spectrum of LVEF.
330 There are no randomized studies that have directly compared the efficacy of these drug
331 classes on HF outcomes. A network meta-analysis of 236 trials randomizing 176,310 subjects
332 over 310,166 participant years reported that SGLT2i significantly lowered HF events compared
333 to control groups (HR 0.62), and relative to GLP-1RAs (HR 0.67) or DPP-4i (HR 0.55).[52]
334 While GLP-1RAs and DPP-4i had no significant difference compared with control groups, GLP-
335 1RAs had fewer HF events relative to DPP-4i (HR 0.82).[52] EMPEROR-HF, DAPA-HF, and
336 SOLOIST-WHF were designed to assess the respective benefits of empagliflozin, dapagliflozin
337 and sotagliflozin in non-DM HF patients, to determine whether their efficacy extends beyond
338 glycemic control to potential diuretic or hemodynamic effects. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME
339 study, HF subjects derived equivalent benefit regardless of the degree of HbA1c
340 improvement.[74] It is thought that natriuresis and osmotic diuresis by SGLT2i, and reduced BP,
341 improve subendocardial blood flow by reducing preload, afterload and arterial stiffness.[73] The
342 recently completed EMPERIAL (Reduced and Preserved) trials failed to improve exercise
343 capacity as measured by the 6-minute walk test.[84] The DAPA-HF study randomized 4,744
344 patients with NYHA II-IV HF with LVEF ≤40% to dapagliflozin vs placebo.[85, 86]
345 Dapagliflozin showed an improvement in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score

(HR 1.18, p<0.001), along with a 32% reduction in new-onset DM.[85, 86] Dapagliflozin also

lowered HFH (HR 0.70) and/or CV death by 26% independent of DM status.[85-87] Further, the

DAPA-CKD study demonstrated profound nephro-protection, along with lower HFH or CV

death with dapagliflozin in CKD patients independent of DM.[88] In an interim analysis of

EMPRISE data, empagliflozin vs sitagliptin had greater reduction in HFH regardless of whether

the HF definition was specific (HR 0.50, p<0.0001) or broad (HR 0.51, p<0.0001). The

EMPEROR-Reduced trial showed that empagliflozin reduced the risk for inpatient or outpatient

worsening HF events and composite of CV death or HFH in NYHA II-IV HFrEF patients

regardless of DM status.[86, 87, 89] Several reasons can account for the differing efficacy of

these drugs on HF outcomes, related to drug pharmacology, adverse event definitions, patient

characteristics, chance, or evolving therapeutics for HF, DM, CKD and CV risk factors.

Take-Home Points:

- SGLT2i are preferred in T2DM patients with CV disease and stable renal function in
  whom glycemic targets have not been met to reduce HFH risk, in particular
  empagliflozin and canagliflozin

- Emerging data with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin demonstrate that SGLT2i may be
  considered for HFrEF treatment regardless of DM status, whereas their benefit in
  HfpEF remains under active investigation

- Incretin-based therapies have shown variable efficacy on HF outcomes, with signals
  for increased HF events seen with saxagliptin

Cross-Talk between Novel AHAs and Heart Failure Therapies Condition Management

368 Novel AHAs such as the incretin-based therapies and SGLT2i, as well as guideline-
369 directed medical therapies (GDMT) for HF, may be mechanistically linked via their engagement
370 of the sodium hydrogen exchanger (NHE) proteins within the myocardium, vasculature, and
371 kidneys.[90] NHE 3 suppression inhibits sodium reabsorption from proximal renal tubules,
372 driving natriuresis and lowering BP.[90] NHE 1 suppression ameliorates myocardial hypertrophy,
373 injury, and fibrosis.[90] Incretin-based therapies can inhibit NHE 3, while SGLT2i and renin-
374 angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) along with certain beta-blockers can inhibit
375 both NHE 3 and NHE 1.[90] However, the benefits of these AHAs may be attenuated if NHE is
376 already inhibited by the concomitant use of certain HF drugs.[90] For instance, the benefit of
377 empagliflozin seen on HF events was minimized in T2DM patients who were already on
378 spironolactone.[74] In the DAPA-HF study, the benefits in terms of primary outcome of HFrEF
379 and CV mortality was less in patients with more severe HF as measured by NYHA III-IV vs II
380 (HR 0.63 [0.52-0.75] vs HR 0.90 [0.74-1.09]), but not by reduced LVEF, elevated natriuretic
381 peptide levels, or worse renal dysfunction.[85] Interestingly, a post-hoc analysis found no
382 difference in primary outcome with dapagliflozin among patients taking vs not taking
383 angiotensin-receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist
384 (MRA) therapy.[91] This will need to be closely evaluated in ongoing studies of incretin-based
385 therapies and SGLT2i in HF patients independent of DM, given these hypothesis generating
386 data.
387 The current GDMT therapies for HF not only improve outcomes in HF patients
388 independent of DM status, but can reduce new-onset DM.[92] This includes non-selective beta-
389 blockers such as carvedilol and nebivolol along with RAASi therapies except for MRAs where
390 study findings remain conflicting; no data yet exists for ivabradine.[93-98] In most dedicated HF

trials, over one-third of enrolled subjects have baseline DM, of which one-third are insulin-
treated. HF can lead to insulin resistance by enhancing gluconeogenesis and reducing insulin
production via an activated sympathetic nervous system, along with other pathophysiologic
mechanisms discussed elsewhere.[56] Beta-blockers and RAASi can attenuate these mechanisms
to prevent myocardial fibrosis and/or insulin resistance.[56] Interestingly, ARNI therapy
improved peripheral insulin sensitivity in obese hypertensive patients.[99] Neprilysin, the neutral
endopeptidase, modulates a number of substrates involved in glucose homeostasis, including
GLP-1, natriuretic peptides, and bradykinin.[100-103] In a post-hoc analysis of the
PARADIGM-HF trial, sacubitril-valsartan enhanced glycemic control relative to enalapril, as
shown by a reduction in HbA1c levels over a 3-year follow-up (between group reduction 0.14%,
p=0.0055) and a 29% lower incidence of new insulin use (HR 0.71, p=0.0052), with a trend
towards fewer patients being started on oral AHAs (HR 0.77, p=0.073).[104-106] While sex-
based differences for HFrEF outcomes were demonstrated in PARAGON-HF with sacubitril-
valsartan vs valsartan, such differences in insulin sensitivity or even de novo DM by LVEF
remain to be explored.[106] By contrast, MRAs have been linked to abnormal glucose
homeostasis, whereas no data on HbA1c levels are available for ivabradine, despite evidence
illustrating that spironolactone (TOPCAT), eplerenone (EPHESUS) and ivabradine (SHIFT)
significantly lower HF outcomes regardless of DM status.[107-109] Future studies evaluating the
efficacy of AHAs and HF therapies will have to address these interesting findings, to help guide
patient-specific therapeutic management. The Diabetes Canada and CCS HF guidelines currently
highlight the importance of diagnosing T2DM, determining LVEF, and then treating as per
recommendations.[2, 3, 43, 44]

Take-Home Points:

- NHE requires further exploration as a mechanistic link between DM and HF
- The interplay between SGLT2i, incretin-based and GDMT HF therapies can impact
  DM and HF outcomes

Conclusions:

In summary, HF and DM frequently co-exist and modulate each other. There may be interplay
between HF therapies and AHAs, which engage several mechanisms implicated in the
pathophysiology of each disease. Along with other CV outcomes, HF remains a common and
morbid complication in DM patients. HF therapies have demonstrated benefit in reducing CV
outcomes related to HF symptom burden, LV function and remodeling, HFH and HF death. We
have reviewed how each condition, AHAs and HF therapies can impact both DM-and HF-
related outcomes across the spectrum of LVEF. While SGLT2i may show benefit preventing and
treating HF, regardless of glycemic status, the GLP-1RAs and DPP-4i have more variable risk-
benefit profiles dependent on the particular drug. Whereas five years ago there were no DM-
specific HF therapies, the SGLT2i have emerged as a key and potent modifier of HFrEF
outcomes, regardless of glycemic status. The healthcare provider now has many options for the
prevention and treatment of HF. These exciting discoveries will finally start to impact the
extreme morbidity and mortality for persons with HF, and DM. Whether agents like SGLT2i
improve outcomes in HFpEF remains important and unanswered at this point in time.

Figure 1: Vicious cycle of interplay between heart failure and diabetes mellitus.

Neurohormonal activation in heart failure (HF) alters metabolism and hemodynamics, exacerbating obesity and insulin resistance. Hyperglycemia from ensuing insulin resistance and eventual pancreatic insufficiency leads to macro- and microvascular dysfunction, resulting in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) more often in the setting of myocardial ischemia or infarction, or in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) more often due to diastolic dysfunction from sarcomeric stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, and fibrosis. Inflammation and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) worsens these latter processes. There is also cross-talk between worsening heart failure and renal dysfunction. The lower cardiac output and high renal venous pressure reduces renal blood flow. Sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation can lead to reduced glomerular filtration from further constriction of afferent glomerular arterioles. This can contribute to hypertension, anemia, and sodium and water retention. These can lead to worsening HF symptoms, which in turn can exacerbate insulin resistance in this vicious cycle. Metformin, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), DPP4 inhibitors (DPP4i) and SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) positively (+) or negatively (-) impact the various steps that contribute to this vicious cycle.

Figure 2: Potential pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to diabetic cardiomyopathy. Insulin resistance (impaired insulin signaling), hyperglycemia (glucotoxicity) and elevated free fatty acids (FFAs) and triglycerides (lipotoxicity) contribute to the “diabetic heart”. Key features include cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, excess collagen fibril cross-linking associated with cardiac fibrosis, and myocyte apoptosis.[8, 11] Transgenic knockout mice with

465 depletion of the cardiomyocyte-specific insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate (IRS), or
466 glucose transporter-4 (GLUT 4) all develop cardiac dysfunction, implicating impaired insulin
467 signaling in this process.[9, 10] Hyperglycemia leads to the formation of advanced glycation
468 end-products (AGE) which, via AGE receptor/interactions, result in reactive oxygen species
469 (ROS) formation, glucotoxicity and cardiac fibrosis leading to diastolic dysfunction.[8]
470 Disrupted intracellular calcium handling with abnormal ryanodine receptor (RyR), SERCa-
471 ATPase (SERCA), sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX), or the Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase
472 (PI3K)/Akt signaling; an impaired endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response contributing to
473 mitochondrial oxidative stress via IRS-1 serine phosphorylation or stress-activated Mitogen-
474 Activated Protein Kinase Jun N-terminal Kinase (MAP JNK); abnormal renin-angiotensin-
475 aldosterone system (RAAS) activation by mammalian Target Of Rapamycin/S6-Kinase 1
476 (mTOR/S6K1) leading to local angiotensin II and aldosterone overproduction that can generate
477 ROS via activation of the Reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH)
478 oxidase enzyme complex; and Akt overexpression via impaired Forkhead box O (FOXO) -
479 dependent and independent mitochondrial energetics all contribute to the “diabetic heart”.[8]
480 Lipotoxicity from ceramide and diacylglycerol accumulation (FA and glycolytic intermediates)
481 within cardiomyocytes from enhanced FFA and triglyceride uptake via the FA transporter CD36,
482 contributes to abnormal mitochondrial energetics (decreased glucose oxidation and increased
483 FFA oxidation) via increased nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha
484 expression, cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation and contractile dysfunction.[8] Endothelial
485 dysfunction via decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and nitric oxide
486 (NO) bioavailability, increased endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression, platelet hyperactivity,

487 inflammation, and oxidative stress also results from insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and  
488 elevated FFAs.[12]
