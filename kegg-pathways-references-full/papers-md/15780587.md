Linking Rap to cell adhesion

Johannes L Bos

The small GTPase Rap1 is involved in several aspects of cell adhesion, including integrin-mediated cell adhesion and cadherin-mediated cell junction formation. Recently, several effector proteins for Rap1 have been identified providing a clear link between Rap1 and actin dynamics. Furthermore, evidence is accumulating that Rap1 functions in the spatial and temporal control of cell polarity.

Introduction

Rap1 is the closest homolog of the small GTPase Ras and, like Ras, cycles between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound conformation. A variety of extracellular signals control this cycle through the regulation of several unique guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) (Figure 1a). Rap1 has attracted much attention because of its involvement in several aspects of cell adhesion, including integrin-mediated cell adhesion and cadherin-mediated cell junction formation. Recently, several novel effector proteins for Rap1 have been identified. In this review, I will highlight the latest findings. For earlier results, please see previous reviews on this topic [1–3].

Rap1 controls cell adhesion

A breakthrough in the understanding of Rap1 was the observation that Rap1 mediates cellular signals that regulate integrins from inside the cell [4–6]. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface molecules that mediate the binding of cells both to other cells and to extracellular matrices. Rap1 regulates all integrins that are associated with the actin cytoskeleton; that is, integrins of the β1, β2 and β3 family, but not integrins linked to intermediate filaments, such as integrin α6β4 [7]. Furthermore, Rap1 controls both integrin activity (affinity) and integrin clustering (avidity) depending on the integrin and the cell type. A striking confirmation of the role of Rap1 in integrin-mediated cell adhesion came from mice deficient for the Rap-specific GEF RasGRP2 (also known as CalDAGGEF1). These mice showed impaired platelet adhesion and aggregation leading to impaired thrombus formation [8**].

More recently, cadherins were added to the list of adhesion molecules that are regulated by Rap1. Cadherins are components of adherens junctions and form calcium-dependent, homotypic interactions to stabilize cell-cell contacts. The cytoplasmic tails of cadherins bind to several proteins, including β-catenin and p120ctn, to form a connection with the actin cytoskeleton.

The first indication that Rap1 is involved in the regulation of cadherins came from studies in Drosophila [9]. In clones of Rap1-deficient cells in the wing, the even distribution of DE-cadherin around the cell was disrupted and condensed to one side of the cell. In addition, cell-cell contact was disrupted and the cells dispersed between the wild-type epithelial cells. This result was corroborated and extended to mammalian cells by several studies. In osteoblasts, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Dock4, an atypical Rap1GEF (which has no CDC25-homology domain), resulted in the disruption of adherens junctions. In addition, in an osteosarcoma cell line deficient for Dock4, the introduction of either Dock4 or Rap1 results in the restoration of adherens junctions [10**]. In an ovarian carcinoma cell line, inhibition of Rap1 resulted in the disappearance of E-cadherin from the cell surface and the disruption of cell junctions. Conversely, scattering of Mandin-Darby canine kidney cells could be inhibited by the activation of Rap1 [11*]. Interestingly, the Rap1GEFC3G directly binds to E-cadherin and might mediate E-cadherin-induced Rap1 activation [12**]. C3G only binds to E-cadherin in immature junctions, which is compatible with the observation that this binding is mutually exclusive with the binding of β-catenin to E-cadherin. However, Rap1 activity is required for the proper localization of E-cadherin to mature cell junctions. Thus, small nascent cell contacts might induce the activation of Rap1 through C3G, followed by Rap1-mediated recruitment of E-cadherin to form mature cell junctions. Importantly, CDC42 can rescue the inhibition of E-cadherin recruitment by Rap1GAP [12**]. Two other Rap1GEFs, Epac and PDZ-GEF1, are also localized within cell junctions, with PDZ-GEF1 being present in a complex with β-catenin [11*,13,14].

For endothelial cells it was found that cAMP-induced tightening of cell junctions is mediated by Epac, a cAMP-responsive Rap1GEF, and Rap1. This Rap1 effect correlates with the recruitment of VE-cadherin and other junction proteins to cell-cell contact sites and with an increase in cortical actin and a decrease in stress fibers. In this process the small GTPase Rho might play a role as activation of Epac can inhibit thrombin-induced activation of Rho [15*, 16*]. The activation or the recruitment of cell surface molecules by Rap1, however, might not be

restricted to integrins and cadherins, as several other membrane proteins were shown to be regulated by Rap1 or by a Rap1GEF, including the cytokine receptor CXCR4 in T-lymphocytes [17**] and Cav3 T-type channels in rat chromaffin cells [18].

### Rap1 effectors

In the past few years, several proteins have been identified that interact with the active form of Rap1. For these, biochemical or genetic evidence has been obtained showing that they are genuine effectors of Rap1 that act in adhesion processes (Figure 1b).

#### Afadin

Afadin (AF-6) is a multidomain adaptor protein that binds to various cell junction proteins, including ZO-1 in tight junctions [19] and nectins in adherens junctions [20]. Strikingly, AF-6 knockout mice have defects in epithelia cell–cell junctions [21]. Rap1 binds directly to the N-terminal Ras-association (RA) domain of AF-6; the functional relevance for this interaction was shown in *Drosophila*, in which AF-6 mediates Rap1-induced dorsal closure [22*]. In mammalian cells, AF-6 might negatively regulate Rap1 through the recruitment of the Rap1GAP Spa1 [23]. AF-6 interacts with an number of additional proteins, including the actin-binding protein profilin [24], but the relevance of these interactions for Rap1 signaling is still unclear. Furthermore, Ras also binds to AF-6 and controls, for instance, the interaction of AF-6 with ZO-1 [19].

#### RapL

A protein clearly involved in Rap1-induced integrin-mediated cell adhesion is RapL, a small protein in which the only recognizable protein motif is an RA domain [17**]. RapL binds to Rap1 and associates with the cytoplasmic tail of the α-chain of integrin αLβ2. For the association of RapL with integrin the C- and N-terminus as well as the RA domain of RapL are required. Importantly, dominant negative RapL inhibits Rap1-induced integrin clustering and adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM). This led to the model that RapL is recruited by Rap1 to associate with and to activate αLβ2. This model is strongly reinforced by the phenotype of RapL knockout mice: in which isolated B and T lymphocytes are much less adherent to ICAM and do not show the characteristic cell polarization and patchy appearance of integrins after stimulation with cytokines. In addition, T-lymphocytes showed an impaired transmigration through endothelial cells under shear stress, whereas both RapL and constitutively active Rap1 induce transmigration. Most likely as a consequence of the defect in integrin-mediated cell adhesion, in vivo B- and T-lymphocytes, as well as dendritic cells show a strong impairment in their homing to targets organs, such as lymph nodes and spleen [25**]. These results establish the important function of RapL in

integrin-mediated cell adhesion, and strongly support the notion that RapL is an effector of Rap1. It remains to be determined whether RapL mediates the activation of all integrins or whether RapL confers unique properties specifically to the αLβ2 integrin. Also, the restricted expression of RapL might indicate that further effector proteins are involved in Rap1-mediated integrin activation as well.

#### Riam

Another protein clearly implicated in Rap1-induced integrin-mediated cell adhesion and cell spreading is Riam, a protein that contains an RA–pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and several proline-rich sequences. Rap1 binding to Riam requires at least both the RA and the PH domains of Riam. Expression of Riam induces cell spreading and integrin-mediated cell adhesion in a similar way to active Rap1, even when endogenous Rap1 is inhibited. In addition, siRNA-mediated knock-down of Riam in Jurkat T-cells abolished Rap-induced integrin-mediated cell adhesion, strongly supporting the idea that Riam is an effector of Rap1. Interestingly, in Riam-knocked-down cells, the F-actin-content is reduced by ~40% and Rap1 is no longer recruited to the actin cytoskeleton at the sites of adhesion, suggesting a role for Riam in actin dynamics. Indeed, Riam binds to both Profilin and Ena/VASP, two proteins that are involved in the regulation of actin dynamics [26*].

#### Arap3

A link between Rap1 and actin dynamics was further indicated by the identification of Arap3 as a Rap1 effector protein. Arap3 has both an ArfGAP domain that is specific for Arf6 and a RhoGAP domain that is specific for RhoA. In addition, Arap3 has several PH domains, one of which interacts with phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). The binding of PIP3 enhances the ArfGAP activity, but not the RhoGAP activity [27]. Interestingly, Arap3 contains an RA domain and the binding of Rap1 enhances RhoGAP activity twofold *in vitro*. Rap1 might be required for the RhoGAP activity of Arap3 *in vivo* because a mutation in the RA domain has the same effect as a mutation in the RhoGAP domain in blocking the ability of Arap3 to inhibit platelet-derived growth factor-induced lamellipodia formation [28*]. This indicates that Arap3 might mediate downregulation of Rho activity as, for instance, shown in thrombin-stimulated endothelial cells [15*].

#### Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors: Vav2 and Tiam1

The most direct link between Rap1 and actin dynamics came from the discovery that Rap1 directly interacts with the RacGEFs nucleotide exchange factors Vav2 and Tiam1 [29**]. Rap1 binds, somewhat surprisingly, to the PH domain of the DH-PH catalytic region of both GEFs, but not to several other RacGEFs. A consequence
of Rap1 binding is the translocation of these GEFs to cell protrusions. Importantly, Rac is both required and sufficient to mediate Rap1-induced cell spreading. RacGEFs that do not bind to Rap1, such as Cool-1/βPIX and Swap-70, can induce cell spreading independently of Rap1. Thus, Rap1 recruits specific RacGEFs to cell extensions for the spatial control of cell spreading. Consistent with this result is the observation that Rap activation results in the activation of Rac [30]. The interaction between Rap1 and GEFs for Rho-like GTPases was previously observed in yeast in which the Rap1 ortholog Bud1 directly interacts with CDC24, a GEF for CDC42 [31,32]. Perhaps more GEFs for Rho-like GTPases operate downstream from Rap1. Indeed, the Cdc42-specific GEF FRG requires Rap1 for its function in nectin-induced activation of Cdc42 and actin dynamics, but how Rap1 regulates FRG is currently unclear [33].

### PDZ-GEF and other Rap effectors

PDZ-GEF, which is a GEF for Rap1, can also serve as an effector for Rap1. This protein has an RA domain that is required for full *in vivo* activity, suggesting that Rap1 binding to PDZ-GEF serves as a positive feedback control [34].

Several other putative Rap1 effectors have been reported, including genuine Ras effectors such as the serine-threonine kinases Raf1 and B-raf, the GEFs of the RalGDS family and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase [1,35], the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Bmx [36], and the adapter protein Krit [37]. Rap2, which can also regulate cell adhesion, might have different effectors to those of Rap1 (i.e. MAP4K4 [MAP kinase kinase kinase 4] and TNIK [Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase]) [38]. Rap2B, but none of the other Rap proteins, interacts with and activates phospholipase C-ε [39]. Although not all of these interactions have yet been proven rigorously to be genuine Rap effector interactions, it indicates that Rap1 might have multiple effectors that function in distinct biological responses.

### Conclusions

A common theme for the various effectors for Rap1 is that they are in some way involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. In its simplest form this was already shown for yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, in which the effector for the Rap1 ortholog Bud1 is a GEF for CDC42, resulting in the recruitment of the actin cytoskeleton to the site of bud formation [31,32]. In mammalian cells, Rap1 has multiple effectors and thus Rap1 is involved in the regulation of multiple proteins. These various effectors might serve separate biological responses, or could cooperate in one function. In this regulation, Rap1 and its GEFs and GAPs might be responsible for the spatial and temporal regulation of actin dynamics, particularly, but not exclusively, at sites of cell adhesion. The spatial control might be through the localization of the GEFs. For instance, in yeast, Bud5 (a GEF for Rsr1) is localized at the future site of the bud by interaction with the transmembrane protein Axl2 [31]. In mammalian cells C3G associates with, for instance, E-cadherin [12**]. Second messengers, such as calcium, diacylglycerol and cAMP, as well as other signals that activate these GEFs might be responsible for the temporal control of Rap1 activation. The interaction of Rap1 with effectors might further stabilize the complex [26*]. The similarity between Rap1 in mammalian cells and yeast is further extended by the observations that Rac and CDC42 are required for the biological effect of Rap1 in the regulation of cell spreading and junction formation [12**,29**]. A striking example of this model is the recent finding that in developing neurons the recruitment of Rap1 to one of the neurites determines the fate of this neurite to become an axon. For this Rap effect, CDC42 is both required and sufficient. This Rap1 effect is mediated by CDC42 and the Par polarity complex [40**]. Not all effects of Rap1 can be captured in a single model, but at least we have a direction.
