Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) eliminates DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in bacteria and eukaryotes. In *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, there are pairwise physical interactions among the core complexes of the NHEJ pathway, namely Yku70–Yku80 (Ku), Dnl4–Lif1 and Mre11–Rad50–Xrs2 (MRX). However, MRX also has a key role in the repair of DSBs by homologous recombination (HR). Here we have examined the assembly of NHEJ complexes at DSBs biochemically and by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Ku first binds to the DNA end and then recruits Dnl4–Lif1. Notably, Dnl4–Lif1 stabilizes the binding of Ku to *in vivo* DSBs. Ku and Dnl4–Lif1 not only initiate formation of the nucleoprotein NHEJ complex but also attenuate HR by inhibiting DNA end resection. Therefore, Dnl4–Lif1 plays an important part in determining repair pathway choice by participating at an early stage of DSB engagement in addition to providing the DNA ligase activity that completes NHEJ.

The repair of potentially cytotoxic and mutagenic DNA DSBs can occur through either relatively error-free homology-dependent repair pathways or error-prone NHEJ pathways${}^{1}$. In mammals, defects in both types of repair have been linked with an increased incidence of cancer and premature aging${}^{2,3}$. The error-prone repair of DSBs by end joining was initially discovered in mammalian cells${}^{4}$. Subsequent studies have shown that this type of repair also occurs in lower eukaryotes and some prokaryotes, and that the fundamental molecular mechanism of NHEJ is conserved${}^{5,6}$.

In *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, Ku, MRX and Dnl4–Lif1 are the core components of the NHEJ machinery${}^{5,6}$. The Ku complex, comprising a heterodimer of the Yku70 and Yku80 proteins, is orthologous to the mammalian DNA end-binding Ku70–Ku80 complex${}^{7}$. In mammals, Ku70–Ku80 interacts with DNA PKcs, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like kinase, at a DNA end to form the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA PK)${}^{8}$. DNA PKcs also functions as a DNA end-bridging factor in NHEJ${}^{8-10}$. Although yeast lacks an obvious homolog of DNA PKcs, the MRX complex seems to be the functional equivalent in that it has robust DNA end-bridging activity${}^{11}$. The DNA ligase that completes NHEJ is DNA ligase IV in mammals and Dnl4 in yeast${}^{12-14}$. In both cases, the DNA ligase is bound to a partner protein, XRCC4 in mammals and Lif1 in yeast, that is required for stability and activity of the DNA ligase${}^{12,15}$.

We have previously shown that intermolecular joining of linear DNA molecules with cohesive ends by Ku, MRX and Dnl4–Lif1 is mediated by physical and functional interactions among these factors${}^{11}$. Specifically, the interaction between Xrs2 and Lif1 is crucial for the stimulation of Dnl4–Lif1 activity by MRX${}^{11}$. In addition, mammalian Ku70–Ku80 cannot substitute for yeast Ku in the reconstituted end-joining reaction${}^{11}$, suggesting that there are species-specific interactions between Ku and the other core NHEJ factors. Consistent with this idea, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies have shown that Yku70 is required for the recruitment of Lif1 to DSBs${}^{16}$. The yeast two-hybrid screen has also been used to detect interactions between Yku80 and Dnl4, and between Yku80 and Mre11 (ref. 17).

Interactions among Ku, MRX and Dnl4–Lif1 probably guide assembly of the NHEJ repair machinery at a DSB. In this study, we have used a combination of *in vitro* and *in vivo* approaches to delineate the assembly of the core NHEJ factors at a DSB. Our results show that Dnl4–Lif1 functions at a very early stage of the NHEJ pathway and suggest that this factor not only has an essential structural role in the assembly of a functional NHEJ complex on DNA ends but also acts in combination with Ku to suppress HR. Thus, in addition to providing the ligase function in NHEJ, Dnl4–Lif1 also helps to direct choice of the DSB repair pathway.

physiological conditions, however, intermolecular ligation becomes dependent on Ku and human Ku70–Ku80 is unable to substitute for yeast Ku¹¹. Although these results imply the existence of species-specific protein-protein interactions involving Ku, we were unable to demonstrate physical interactions between Ku and the other factors in pull-down assays with purified proteins (data not shown). We therefore tested whether these factors associate in a DNA-dependent manner by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) under conditions where efficient intermolecular ligation is dependent on Ku, MRX and Dnl4–Lif1 (ref. 11). Initially, we examined the individual binding of Ku, MRX and Dnl4–Lif1 to a linear 500-base-pair (bp) duplex oligonucleotide immobilized on the sensor chip. Although all three proteins bound to the chip surface (Fig. 1a), there were notable differences in their DNA-binding properties (Supplementary Table 1 online). Similar to mammalian Ku70–Ku80 (ref. 18), yeast Ku bound efficiently and stably, maintaining contact with the immobilized DNA throughout the injection and dissociation periods (Fig. 1a). By contrast, binding of MRX to the chip surface was much less stable than that of Ku (Fig. 1a) and, owing to a slow on rate, MRX binding did not reach saturation. As compared with Ku and MRX, Dnl4–Lif1 showed the highest initial rate of association with DNA, but less Dnl4–Lif1 bound to the DNA sensor chip (Fig. 1a).

Because MRX interacts with Dnl4–Lif1 (ref. 11), we tested whether co-injecting these factors would influence their DNA binding. The DNA-binding profile of the mixture was very similar to that of Dnl4–Lif1 alone (Fig. 1b). In addition, co-injection of Dnl4–Lif1 also reduced MRX binding to a 45-bp DNA duplex on the sensor chip even though binding of Dnl4-Lif1 alone was much less efficient (Supplementary Fig. 1 online). Thus, Dnl4–Lif1 suppresses direct DNA binding by MRX. It is possible that MRX slightly enhances DNA binding by Dnl4–Lif1, because we reproducibly observed more protein binding after co-injection than after injection of Dnl4–Lif1 alone (Fig. 1b).

Because Ku bound stably to the DNA chip (Fig. 1a), we examined the interactions of Dnl4–Lif1 and MRX with DNA bound by Ku. MRX binding to the DNA chip preloaded with Ku was markedly reduced as compared with the DNA chip alone, but the shapes of the binding profiles were similar (Fig. 1c). MRX preferentially binds at DNA ends¹¹; therefore, the presence of Ku at the DNA end may inhibit this preferred mode of DNA binding by MRX. By contrast, the presence of Ku on the DNA chip markedly enhanced the binding of Dnl4–Lif1 to the chip surface (Fig. 1d), suggesting that Dnl4–Lif1 is actively recruited to DNA-bound Ku. When Dnl4–Lif1 and MRX were co-injected onto DNA bound by Ku (Fig. 1e), protein binding was increased compared with when either Dnl4–Lif1 or MRX was injected alone. By contrast, co-injection of MRX and Dnl4–Lif1 onto the DNA chip in the absence of Ku resulted in reduced protein binding as compared with injection of MRX alone (Fig. 1c).

Together, these results suggest that MRX promotes the binding of Dnl4–Lif1 to DNA bound by Ku, possibly by interacting with DNA–protein complexes composed of Ku and Dnl4–Lif1. To provide support for this idea, we preloaded Ku and Dnl4-Lif1 onto the DNA chip by sequential injection and then examined the binding of MRX (Fig. 1f). Under these conditions, more MRX bound than when only Ku was bound to the DNA (compare Fig. 1c and f). Although there are other possible explanations, this result is consistent with the idea that MRX associates specifically with DNA bound by both Ku and Dnl4–Lif1.

Ku-dependent binding of Dnl4-Lif1 to DNA

To confirm that Dnl4-Lif1 binds to DNA in a Ku-dependent manner, we characterized the DNA-protein complexes formed on a 400-bp DNA substrate by combinations of Ku and Dnl4-Lif1 in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) after glutaraldehyde cross-linking. As expected, Ku formed a complex with the linear DNA substrate, whereas no nucleoprotein complexes with Dnl4-Lif1 were detected under similar reaction conditions (Fig. 2a). This result was consistent with the relatively transient DNA binding of Dnl4-Lif1 observed by SPR. When Ku was co-incubated with the DNA substrate and Dnl4-Lif1, we observed a new, slower-migrating DNA-protein complex, which increased with increasing amounts of Dnl4-Lif1 (Fig. 2a). The presence of both Ku and Dnl4-Lif1 in this DNA-protein complex was confirmed in supershift experiments with antibodies to Ku and Lif1 (Fig. 2b).

All three antibodies altered the mobility of the new protein-DNA complexes, indicating that the three core NHEJ complexes are simultaneously bound to the same DNA molecule. Together, these in vitro results show that, although direct DNA binding by MRX is inhibited, MRX specifically interacts with DNA bound by Ku and Dnl4-Lif1.

Recruitment of NHEJ proteins to in vivo DSBs

Because of the unexpected observation that Dnl4-Lif1 seems to act earlier than MRX in nucleoprotein complex assembly in vitro, we used ChIP to examine the temporal order of recruitment of the core NHEJ factors to in vivo DSBs. As expected¹⁹,²⁰, HO endonuclease-induced DSBs in donorless yeast strains, either JKM179 (MATα) or SLY1A (MATa), formed at the MAT locus (Supplementary Fig. 2a online) within half an hour at 30 °C upon expression of the HO endonuclease (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Because most repair events will accurately restore the HO site, there will be a cycle of assembly and disassembly of the core NHEJ factors when HO endonuclease is continuously expressed²¹,²². We found that Ku, MRX and Lif1 were rapidly recruited to the DSB sites and that Ku reached maximum steady-state binding in 1 h, whereas Lif1 and MRX continued to accumulate for up to 2 h (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Similar results were obtained with cultures grown at 18°C (Supplementary Fig. 2b,d). Recruitment of the NHEJ proteins did not seem to be regulated as a function of cell-cycle stage, because the kinetics of their recruitment was essentially identical in SLY1A cells arrested in G1 (α factor) or G2 (nocodazole; data not shown).

Next, we tested whether genetic inactivation of one of the three core NHEJ complexes influenced the recruitment of the remaining two complexes. As expected, the efficiency of DSB formation was not affected in the various mutant strains (Supplementary Fig. 3 online). In agreement with the in vitro experiments (Figs. 1 and 2), association of the Mre11 (Fig. 3a) and Rad50 (Fig. 3b) subunits of the MRX complex at the DSB was reduced but not abolished in the absence of either Yku70 or a functional Dnl4-Lif1 complex. Thus, although maximum recruitment or retention of MRX at DSBs is dependent on both Ku and Dnl4-Lif1, there must be at least one other recruitment mechanism.

MRX binding to DNA mediated by Ku and Dnl4-Lif1

The results of the SPR studies (Fig. 1) suggested that the interaction between MRX and Dnl4-Lif1 might specifically enhance the binding of one or both factors to Ku-bound DNA. We therefore characterized the DNA-protein complexes formed on a 400-bp DNA substrate by combinations of Ku, MRX and Dnl4-Lif1 in EMSAs. MRX alone did not form a detectable DNA-protein complex (Fig. 2c) and did not generate a new DNA-protein complex in combination with either Ku (Fig. 2c) or Dnl4-Lif1 (data not shown). When Ku and Dnl4-Lif1 were co-incubated with the DNA substrate and increasing amounts of MRX, however, a slower-migrating doublet of DNA-protein complexes that was distinct from the Ku-DNA complex and the Ku-Dnl4-Lif1-DNA complex was detected (Fig. 2c). The formation of the new DNA-protein complexes required the addition of higher concentrations of MRX (7- to 40-fold) as compared with Ku and Dnl4-Lif1, which may be because of the transient nature of MRX binding in either the presence (Fig. 1f) or the absence (Fig. 1a) of Ku and Dnl4-Lif1. When increasing amounts of MRX were included in the reactions, the Ku-Dnl4-Lif1-DNA complex was reduced in quantity but the Ku-DNA complex was not (Fig. 2c), suggesting that the slower-migrating complexes contain all three core NHEJ factors.

We therefore tested whether the mobility of the new complexes could be shifted by antibodies to Xrs2, Lif1 or Ku (Fig. 2d).

Data represent the mean ± s.d. of three or more independent experiments.

The accumulation of both Lif1 and Ku at the DSB site was markedly increased in both an mre11Δ strain (Fig. 3c,d) and a rad50 strain (data not shown). It is possible that MRX-mediated nucleolytic resection of DNA ends²³ interferes with Ku and Lif1 binding at DSBs. Enhanced binding of Ku at DSBs in cells lacking a functional MRX complex cannot be explained solely by a deficiency in DNA end resection, however, because attenuating DNA end resection by inducing cell-cycle arrest in G1 or by means of the Sic1-mediated inhibition of Cdc28 (refs. 24,25) led to only a small increase in the binding of Ku (Supplementary Fig. 4 online). In addition, expression of the nuclease-defective mre11-3 protein²⁶, which retains the ability to bind Rad50 and Xrs2, restored the extent and patterns of Ku and Lif1 association with the DSB to those observed in the wild-type strain (data not shown). It thus seems that, when the MRX DNA end-bridging factor is absent, Ku and Dnl4–Lif1 form a stable complex at the DSB. Alternatively, it is possible that there is hyper-recruitment of Ku and Dnl4–Lif1 to DSBs in the absence of MRX.

Stable binding of Ku at DSBs requires Dnl4–Lif1

In agreement with previous data¹⁶, we found that recruitment of Lif1 to the DSB is dependent on a functional Ku complex (Fig. 3c). We also found that the absence of Dnl4, which does not influence the cellular amounts of Lif1 (ref. 15), abolished the recruitment of Lif1 to

strain. Both $dnl4\Delta$ and $lif1\Delta$ strains showed a similar enhanced resistance to phleomycin (Fig. 4a). Notably, inactivation of either $LIF1$ or $YKU70$ in a $rad52\Delta$ strain that is defective in HR did not improve the resistance to phleomycin (Fig. 4b), suggesting that the observed increase in resistance to DSBs in the absence of either Ku or Dnl4–Lif1 was indeed due to enhanced HR.

If the increase in HR in $lif1\Delta$ strains is caused by attenuated Ku binding at DSBs, then genetic inactivation of $LIF1$ in a strain lacking a functional Ku complex should not result in a further increase in resistance to DNA damage as compared with the single mutants. In accord with this idea, the survival of a $lif1\Delta yku70\Delta$ double mutant strain at different doses of phleomycin was indistinguishable from that of the $yku70\Delta$ strain (Fig. 4b). In addition, the increased resistance of the $lif1\Delta$ strain was almost completely suppressed by overexpression of Ku (Fig. 4c). Thus, these results identify a previously unknown role for Dnl4–Lif1 in suppression of HR and indicate that stabilization of Ku binding at DSBs may be the mechanism by which Dnl4–Lif1 inhibits HR.

Dnl4–Lif1 inhibits 5′→3′ end resection

Because mating type gene conversion also occurs through HR (Fig. 5), quantitative analysis of this HO endonuclease-initiated DNA rearrangement provides an alternative measure of the efficiency of HR. In initial experiments with asynchronous cell populations, genetic inactivation of either $DNL4$ or $LIF1$ had no discernible effect on the

frequency of mating type switch recombination. Because NHEJ requiring Dnl4–Lif1 is most active in the G1 phase of the cell cycle²⁴,²⁵, we examined mating type switching in cells arrested in G1 by α-factor (Supplementary Fig. 5a online). Consistent with the results of the cell survival studies (Fig. 4), mating type gene conversion was increased in the absence of a functional Dnl4–Lif1 complex and, to a greater extent, in the absence of a functional Ku complex (Fig. 5b,c), confirming that HR is enhanced in these mutant strains and that both Ku and Dnl4–Lif1 suppress HR.

It has been proposed that Ku binding at DSBs suppresses HR by inhibiting the 5′→3′ exonucleolytic resection of DNA ends that is required for the generation of single-stranded DNA and the subsequent assembly of the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament²⁹,³³. In G1-arrested cell populations (Supplementary Fig. 5b), genetic inactivation of either *DNL4* or *LIF1* resulted in accelerated end resection, albeit to a lesser extent than when Ku was absent (Fig. 6a,b). Concomitant with this increase in resection, we observed a proportional increase in the amount of Rfa1 and Rad51 binding at DSBs in *lif1* and *yku70* strains (Fig. 6c,d). Together, these results show that, similar to Ku, Dnl4–Lif1 negatively regulates HR by attenuating the generation of single-stranded DNA at the DSB.

### DISCUSSION

Genetic and biochemical studies have identified Ku, MRX and Dnl4–Lif1 as key components of the NHEJ pathway in yeast⁵. Pairwise interactions among these factors suggest that their actions may be coordinated by assembly into a large complex at DSB sites¹⁷. Here we have examined the assembly of the core NHEJ factors at DNA ends by a combination of *in vitro* and *in vivo* approaches. A key common finding of both approaches is that Dnl4–Lif1, which catalyzes the last step in the repair process, also has an essential role early in engagement of DNA ends.

Previous studies have described physical and functional interactions between human Ku70–Ku80 and DNA ligase IV–XRCC4 (refs. 34,35), and the association of DNA Ligase IV–XRCC4 with a DNA end bound by Ku70–Ku80 causes inward translocation of the Ku70–Ku80 ring³⁶. Because Ku70–Ku80 is also translocated inward when it interacts with DNA PKcs to form the DNA PK complex³⁷ and DNA PKcs functions as the DNA end-bridging factor⁹,¹⁰,³⁸, the biological relevance of the interaction between human Ku70–Ku80 and DNA ligase IV–XRCC4 remains unclear, particularly because there are contradictory reports concerning whether the recruitment of DNA ligase IV–XRCC4 is dependent on the prior assembly of DNA PK at the DNA end³⁴,³⁹–⁴¹. By contrast, our *in vivo* studies in yeast provide compelling evidence that the complex formed at DNA ends by Ku and Dnl4–Lif1 is biologically relevant. First, Dnl4–Lif1 stabilizes Ku binding at DNA ends. Second, the ability of Ku to suppress HR is markedly reduced in the absence of Dnl4–Lif1. Third, both Ku and Dnl4–Lif1 are required for efficient recruitment of MRX, the DNA end-bridging factor in yeast NHEJ.

The binding of mammalian Ku70–Ku80 to *in vivo* DSBs is dynamic⁴¹. Our ChIP experiments in the absence of formaldehyde confirmed that yeast Ku shuttles on and off DNA ends *in vivo* but, more importantly, revealed that Dnl4–Lif1 promotes the stable binding of Ku to DSBs. In contrast to the *in vivo* studies, DNA end binding by mammalian Ku70–Ku80 (refs. 18,42) and yeast Ku *in vitro* is stable even on short DNA duplexes. This observation suggests that, *in vivo*, there are protein factors that actively displace Ku from DNA ends. Indeed, accumulating evidence indicates that the eukaryotic HR and NHEJ repair machineries compete to repair DSBs *in vivo*²⁹,⁴³–⁴⁵. Our results show that complex formation between Ku and Dnl4–Lif1 at a

DNA end not only is a key intermediate in the stepwise assembly of the NHEJ repair machinery but also effectively sequesters DNA ends from the HR machinery by preventing the DNA end resection that is a prerequisite for formation of the Rad51 presynaptic protein filament. In contrast to DNA binding by Ku, DNA binding by Dnl4–Lif1 was markedly dependent on the length of the DNA molecule. DNA binding by XRCC4, the human functional homolog of Lif1, shows a similar dependence on DNA length and a preference for DNA molecules of >200 bp (ref. 46). This observation suggests that the Lif1 subunit may be the primary determinant of DNA binding by the Dnl4–Lif1 complex. It is intriguing that the DNA-binding preference of Dnl4–Lif1 *in vitro* is a good match with the length of nucleosome-free DNA generated at an *in vivo* DSB²⁰. Additional factors, such as the Lif1-interacting protein Nej1 (refs. 47–49), may modulate Dnl4–Lif1 binding to DSBs. The presence of a complex containing Ku and Dnl4–Lif1 at DNA ends may either directly prevent the end resection proteins from loading onto the broken DNA or indirectly block end resection by modulating chromatin remodeling at the break site.

In addition to protecting against nucleolytic degradation, the Ku–Dnl4–Lif1 complex formed at DNA ends recruits MRX, the DNA end-bridging factor. Because MRX is also involved in the end resection step of HR²³,³³, it is possible that MRX is recruited by different mechanisms for HR and NHEJ. This model is supported by our observation that MRX recruitment to *in vivo* DSBs still occurs in the absence of either Ku or Dnl4–Lif1, albeit to a reduced extent. In addition, our biochemical studies demonstrated that there are two modes of DNA binding by MRX: direct DNA binding and DNA binding that is dependent on both Ku and Dnl4–Lif1. As both Ku and Dnl4–Lif1 also direct DNA binding by MRX, these factors prevent HR not only by sequestering MRX in the NHEJ pathway but also by inhibiting the DNA-binding activity of MRX that presumably occurs at a DNA end in the context of the HR reaction.

In human cells, DNA-end bridging occurs through protein-protein interactions between DNA PKcs molecules on each of the DNA ends¹⁰,³⁸. By contrast, visualization of MRX-mediated DNA end bridging by atomic force microscopy showed that one MRX complex holds together two DNA ends¹¹. We therefore suggest that, in yeast NHEJ, a single MRX complex juxtaposes two DNA ends through contacts with the DNA termini and the Ku–Dnl4–Lif1 complexes on each end. Most DSBs generated *in vivo* require processing before ligation. Although there seems to be redundancy in the end-processing reactions that generate ligatable termini, genetic studies have implicated Pol4 (ref. 50), a DNA polymerase of the Pol X family, and FEN-1 (also known as Rad27; ref. 51), a DNA structure-specific endonuclease, in a subset of end-processing events. Because Dnl4–Lif1 coordinates end processing and ligation through physical interactions with both Pol4 and FEN-1 (refs. 52,53), this complex has an essential role at every stage of NHEJ that follows the initial end engagement by Ku.

Although repair of DSBs by NHEJ occurs in all eukaryotes, there are clear differences among organisms, specifically in terms of the protein factors participating and the molecular mechanism of the principal NHEJ pathways of yeast and humans⁶. The most prominent is the presence of the protein kinase subunit DNA-PKcs, which interacts with Ku70–Ku80 in mammals to form DNA-PK. It is possible that evolution of the highly efficient DNA PK-dependent NHEJ pathway of mammals was driven by the difficulties and potential risks of repairing DSBs by homology-dependent mechanisms in large genomes with high levels of repetitive sequence. Notably, the symptoms of several individuals with mutations in the *LIG4* gene resemble those of individuals with Nijmegen breakage syndrome, which is caused by
mutations in the NBS gene encoding the functional equivalent of the Xrs2 subunit of yeast MRX⁵⁴. These observations, together with biochemical studies linking the human Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex with end joining⁵⁵,⁵⁶, suggest that a subpathway of NHEJ analogous to the main yeast NHEJ pathway has an important role during human development and/or under specific circumstances in adult somatic cells.

### METHODS

#### Yeast NHEJ proteins and antibodies.
Ku, Dnl4–Lif1 and MRX were purified as described¹¹. Rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for Lif1 and Ku were generated by immunization with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Lif1 protein purified from *Escherichia coli* and Ku protein purified from yeast, respectively. Antibodies to Rad50, Mre11, Xrs2, Rad51 and Rfa1 have been described¹¹,⁵⁷,⁵⁸.

#### Surface plasmon resonance.
DNA-binding experiments were performed on a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore Inc.). A 5′-biotinylated forward primer and a nonbiotinylated reverse primer were used to amplify a product of ~500 bp by PCR using *Pfu* polymerase (Stratagene). The purified biotinylated PCR product was diluted in running buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA and 0.05% (v/v) surfactant P-20) before being coupled to one cell of a four-cell streptavidin-coated SA sensor chip in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. The concentration of biotinylated duplex DNA immobilized on the cell surface was 12 μM. All DNA concentrations are expressed in terms of DNA molecules. The sensorgrams were generated at a flow rate of 10 μl min⁻¹. Proteins were diluted in running buffer before being injected for 3 min, after which there was a 2.5-min dissociation phase in which running buffer flowed through the flow cell. Proteins were simultaneously injected over a cell surface lacking the oligonucleotide to detect nonspecific binding, which was subtracted from the binding observed in the DNA cell to generate the reported sensorgram. We carried out all experiments in triplicate. Kinetic evaluation was done with the manufacturer’s software (Evaluation version 4.1, Biacore). The kinetic evaluation curves were fitted by using four different protein concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 25 nM. We regenerated the chip surface by incubation for 60 s with 0.05% SDS solution, followed by incubation for 30 s with running buffer containing 500 mM NaCl.

#### Electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
A 400-bp linear duplex DNA fragment was generated by EcoRI digestion and end-labeled as described¹¹. Where indicated, labeled DNA substrate (0.75 nM) was incubated for 15 min on ice with combinations of Ku, Dnl4–Lif1 and MRX in reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol and 5% glycerol. DNA–protein complexes were cross-linked by incubation with glutaraldehyde at a final concentration of 0.02% for 10 min on ice. To confirm the presence of specific proteins in the cross-linked DNA–protein complexes, we added antibodies for the various core NHEJ factors and continued the incubation for 10 min. After separation by agarose gel electrophoresis (0.7% agarose, w/v), labeled DNA species were visualized in the dried gel by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).

#### Yeast strains and induction of HO endonuclease expression.
Genotypes of yeast strains are listed in Supplementary Table 2 online. A 13×Myc tag was added to the C terminus of the Lif1 protein by replacing the *LIF1* gene of SLY1A with a PCR fragment generated with primers flanking the 3′ end of the *LIF1* gene (*Lif1*-Myc-5′, 5′-AACAAATCCGGTAATGATGGGAACCTTGCTTGC AGACAGAATCGGAAAACGGATATAGAAACAGGAAACAAAAGCTGGAG-3′; *Lif1*-Myc-3′, 5′-ATAAAGTATTCTCTCAAATGATGCGGATACTATAATACTCTTT GCCATATATTACATTCATTCCCTATAGGGCGAATTTGGGT-3′) and the plasmid pFA6A-13MYC-KanMX6 as the template⁵⁹. We induced the expression of HO endonuclease by adding 2% galactose (w/v) to logarithmic cultures (1 × 10⁷ cells ml⁻¹) grown in YEP-glycerol medium at 30 °C (ref. 19). The extent of cleavage at the HO site was determined by quantitative PCR, wherein the product from a pair of primers (CUT) flanking the DSB¹⁹ was compared with that from PRE1 primers amplifying a distant region of the genome lacking an HO site¹⁹. Cell synchronization at G1 by α-factor treatment or at G2 by nocodazole was done as described⁶⁰. Flow-cytometry analysis was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur System as described¹⁹.

---

Chromatin immunoprecipitation. We carried out ChIP as described¹⁹ with minor modifications. In brief, HO endonuclease was induced in yeast cultures as described above. After *in vivo* cross-linking of nucleic acids and proteins by 1% formaldehyde (v/v), cells were lysed and genomic DNA was sonicated to yield fragments with an average size of 0.5 kilobases. Sonicated extracts were incubated with antibodies to Ku, Mre11, Rad50, Rad51, Rfa1 or Myc at 4 °C for 2 h, and then with protein G–agarose beads for 1 h. After cross-link reversal, genomic DNA was purified and amplified by real-time quantitative PCR using an ABI Prism 7900 instrument (PE Applied Biosystems) with multiple primer sets that annealed at sites 0.1–0.9 kilobases proximal (L) or distal (R) to the DSB and with primers specific for the *PRE1* gene situated on chromosome V. PCR reactions were set up in accordance with the manufacturer’s standard real-time PCR protocol (PE Applied Biosystems). The recruitment of protein to an HO break is expressed as relative immunoprecipitate, which represents the ratio of a specific PCR signal at the HO break (determined with LM primers) to the nonspecific signal at a distant locus (determined with PRE1 primers), normalized to the value obtained from the uninduced sample (0 h).

#### Analysis of 5′→3′ end processing of the DSB.
Genomic DNA extracted by standard glass-bead purification was digested with EcoRV, separated on a 1.0% agarose gel, and probed with DNA fragments containing the HO cleavage site of *MAT* on chromosome III and the *HIS3* gene on chromosome XV. We determined the amount of DNA in each band with a PhosphorImager, using the *HIS3* band as an internal loading control. End resection was measured by the disappearance of the HO cut fragment as described²⁴.
