# Molecular mechanisms of necroptosis: an ordered cellular explosion

**Peter Vandenabeele**, **Lorenzo Galluzzi**, **Tom Vanden Berghe**, and **Guido Kroemer**

Abstract | For a long time, apoptosis was considered the sole form of programmed cell death during development, homeostasis and disease, whereas necrosis was regarded as an unregulated and uncontrollable process. Evidence now reveals that necrosis can also occur in a regulated manner. The initiation of programmed necrosis, ‘necroptosis’, by death receptors (such as tumour necrosis factor receptor 1) requires the kinase activity of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1; also known as RIPK1) and RIP3 (also known as RIPK3), and its execution involves the active disintegration of mitochondrial, lysosomal and plasma membranes. Necroptosis participates in the pathogenesis of diseases, including ischaemic injury, neurodegeneration and viral infection, thereby representing an attractive target for the avoidance of unwarranted cell death.

Biased by their focus on life, biologists have neglected cell death for a long time. Although the first morphological descriptions of cellular demise date back to the mid-nineteenth century, the notion of ‘programmed cell death’ was formulated by Lockshin as late as 1964 (REF. 1). In the early 1970s, Kerr, Wyllie and Currie discovered a peculiar type of mammalian cell death that they dubbed ‘apoptosis’ (REF. 2). The stereotyped features of apoptosis (BOX 1) suggested that it would constitute a regulated cell death process, a notion that was elegantly shown in *Caenorhabditis elegans* by the Horvitz laboratory in 1980–1990 (reviewed in REF. 3). Textbooks soon thought of apoptosis and necrosis as opposed mechanisms (BOX 1), necrosis being considered as a purely accidental and passive cell death subroutine. The first morphological classification of cell death was proposed by Schweichel and Merker<sup>4</sup> who described, in rat embryos exposed to toxicants, type I cell death associated with heterophagy, type II cell death associated with autophagy and type III cell death without digestion. Today, these cell death modes are referred to as apoptosis, autophagic cell death and necrosis, respectively<sup>5</sup>.

The purely unregulated nature of necrosis was questioned in 1988, when it was discovered that distinct cell types died in response to the same trigger, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), while manifesting either the ‘classical’ features of apoptosis or a ‘balloon-like’ morphology without nuclear disintegration<sup>6</sup>. Since then, accumulating evidence has paved the way to the concept of ‘programmed necrosis’ (TIMELINE), culminating in the introduction, in 2005, of the neologism necroptosis to describe one instance of regulated (as opposed to accidental) necrotic cell death<sup>7</sup>. Over the past two decades, a plethora of molecules and processes have been characterized as initiators, modulators or effectors of necroptosis. These include (but are not limited to): receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1; also known as RIPK1), RIP3 (also known as RIPK3)<sup>8-12</sup>, caspase inhibitors<sup>13</sup>, ubiquitin E3 ligases, deubiquitinating enzymes<sup>11,14</sup>, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by mitochondria or NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1)<sup>15-17</sup>, bioenergetic reactions such as glycolysis<sup>12</sup> and glutaminolysis<sup>12,18</sup>, pro-apoptotic B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family members<sup>14</sup>, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)<sup>19</sup>, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex (PTPC)<sup>20-22</sup>, lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP)<sup>23,24</sup> and lysosomal, mitochondrial and cytosolic hydrolases<sup>23-25</sup>.

Altogether, it seems that multiple signal transducers and metabolic processes can ignite or mediate cellular demolition by necrosis (Supplementary information S1 (table)), thereby constituting targets for the therapeutic suppression of necroptosis, a possibility that has raised huge expectations<sup>26</sup>. As the underlying molecular mechanisms have only recently begun to emerge, a comprehensive review on necroptosis is timely and may shed new light on research areas that, until now, have been dominated by apoptosis. Here, we provide a detailed description of the molecular mechanisms of necroptosis and briefly discuss its immunological outcomes and pathophysiological implications.

### Initiation of necroptosis: the receptors

A sizeable fraction of cells dying *in vivo* in response to ischaemia-reperfusion, physical or chemical trauma, viral or bacterial infection, or neurodegenerative processes exhibit morphological features of necrosis<sup>27</sup> (BOX 1). Although necrosis was initially believed to be triggered by excessively harsh microenvironmental conditions, killing cells in an uncontrollable manner, it turned out that the molecular mechanisms of pathological cell loss (in particular ischaemia-reperfusion-induced necrosis) partially overlap with the biochemical cascades that mediate necroptosis (reviewed in REF. 28).

#### Heterophagy
A term of Greek origin indicating the cellular digestion of an exogenous substance, cell or subcellular particle that has been taken up from the extracellular microenvironment.

#### Autophagy
A pathway for the recycling of cellular contents, in which materials inside the cell are packaged into vesicles and are then targeted to the vacuole or lysosome for bulk turnover. Autophagy is thought to be prominently cytoprotective.

#### Caspase
A Cys protease that cleaves its substrate after an Asp residue. Caspases play a crucial part in both the initiation (caspase 2, caspase 8, caspase 9 and caspase 10) and execution (caspase 3, caspase 6 and caspase 7) of apoptosis, and they are also required for many processes that are unrelated to cell death, such as the differentiation of several cell types<sup>161</sup>.

#### Glutaminolysis
The bioenergetic pathway by which Glu or Gln is converted to α-ketoglutarate, an intermediate of the Krebs cycle. Thus, glutaminolysis can provide substrates for ATP generation by oxidative phosphorylation or stimulate the generation of pyruvate through malate decarboxylation.

#### Mitochondrial permeability transition
Long-lasting openings of the PTPC lead to an abrupt increase in the inner mitochondrial membrane's permeability to ions and low-molecular-mass solutes, thus provoking osmotic swelling of the mitochondrial matrix and rupture of the mitochondrial outer membrane.

#### Apoptotic body
A membrane-surrounded vesicle that is shed from dying cells during the late stages of apoptosis and that may include portions of the nucleus and/or apparently normal organelles.

presence of caspase inhibitors (which block apoptosis) unveils a caspase-independent cell death pathway that emanates from death receptors and culminates in a necrotic morphology<sup>33</sup>.

#### Death receptors in the initiation of necroptosis.
Necroptosis can be induced by the ligation of death receptors, including CD95 (also known as FAS; which binds the ligand CD95L (also known as FASL))<sup>29</sup>, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), TNFR2 (REFS 6, 13, 30), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 1 (TRAILR1) and TRAILR2 (REF. 9.) These receptors usually activate the apoptotic machinery, and their cytotoxicity often requires the presence of transcriptional or translational inhibitors, suggesting the existence of short-lived cytoprotective proteins that are continuously being synthesized (reviewed in REFS 31, 32). Nevertheless, in some cell lines and primary cells, the

#### PRRs in the initiation of necroptosis.
Although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive, it seems that necroptosis can also be initiated by members of the pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) family, which include plasma membrane or endosome membrane-associated Toll-like receptors, cytosolic NOD-like receptors and retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors. All of these are expressed by cells of the innate immune system to sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as viral or bacterial nucleotides, lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharide or peptidoglycans, and respond by triggering inflammation or cell death<sup>34</sup>.

Various PAMPs have been shown to induce necroptosis by activating PRRs in different cell types. For example, viral dsRNA induces necroptotic cell death in human Jurkat T lymphocytes and murine fibrosarcoma L929 cells<sup>35</sup>, and lipopolysaccharide does so in macrophages when caspase 8 activity is inhibited<sup>36</sup>. Similarly, the Gram-negative bacterium *Shigella flexneri* triggers necroptosis in neutrophils<sup>37</sup> and in

**Box 1 | Morphological aspects of necrosis versus apoptosis**

In 1972, Kerr and colleagues introduced the term ‘apoptosis’ (a Greek word describing falling leaves) to indicate a type of cell death that is morphologically distinct from necrosis<sup>2</sup>. For more than three decades, apoptosis was considered the sole mechanism of developmental and homeostatic cell death, as well as the only outcome of the activation of a specific class of proteases, caspases<sup>161</sup>. Now, multiple types of cell death have been classified according to morphological, biochemical or functional aspects, generating a rather diversified nomenclature<sup>5</sup>. Although biochemical definitions are expected to gradually replace the current vocabulary, the terms apoptosis and necrosis are firmly established in scientific literature<sup>5</sup>.

Apoptosis exhibits peculiar morphological traits, including pseudopod retraction, the rounding up of cells, decreased cellular volume (pyknosis), chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), blebbing of the intact plasma membrane, shedding of vacuoles containing cytoplasmic portions and apparently unchanged organelles (known as apoptotic bodies), and the *in vivo* uptake of apoptotic corpses by neighbouring cells or professional phagocytes (see the figure, part **a**). When phagocytosis is inefficient, apoptotic bodies progressively lose integrity and their content spills into the extracellular milieu (secondary necrosis).

Dying cells were initially catalogued as necrotic in a negative manner; that is, when they failed to display the morphology of apoptotic or autophagic cell death<sup>5</sup>. However, necrotic cells exhibit some common morphological features, including an increasingly translucent cytoplasm, swelling of organelles, minor ultrastructural modifications of the nucleus (specifically, dilatation of the nuclear membrane and condensation of chromatin into small, irregular, circumscribed patches) and increased cell volume (oncosis), culminating in the disruption of the plasma membrane (see the figure, part **b**). Necrotic cells do not fragment into discrete corpses as their apoptotic counterparts do. Moreover, their nuclei remain intact and can aggregate and accumulate in necrotic tissues.

Importantly, although the signalling pathways and/or biochemical events leading to necroptosis, accidental necrosis and secondary necrosis are clearly distinct, these cell death modes are accompanied by similar end-stage degradation and disintegration processes, implying that it is impossible to discriminate among them based on single end-point morphological assessments<sup>24,162,163</sup>.

human monocyte-derived macrophages³⁸. The lethal response of macrophages to *S. flexneri* depends on the inflammasome component NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3; also known as NALP3 and cryopyrin) and shares features with the excessive necrosis seen in monocytes of patients affected by autoinflammatory disorders caused by NLRP3 gain-of-function mutations³⁹. Viral infections have repeatedly been reported to promote cell death with necrotic features³⁰, although this often results from supraphysiologically high viral loads that directly perturb the plasma membrane⁴⁰. Infection by vaccinia virus, which encodes the caspase inhibitor B13R (also known as Spi2), has been shown to shift to necroptosis the otherwise apoptotic demise of T cells succumbing to activation-induced cell death and of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) killed by TNF¹⁰. Similarly, whereas the infection of pig kidney cells by strains of cowpox virus expressing cytokine response modifier protein A (CrmA; a potent and specific inhibitor of caspase 8) resulted in cytopathic effects consistent with necrotic death, CrmA-deficient viruses generated an apoptotic cell death phenotype⁴¹. These examples underscore the notion that viral infection and PAMP-activated PRRs can facilitate necroptosis. However, our Review will focus on TNFR1-initiated necroptosis, as this is the most extensively studied model of programmed necrosis to date.

**Inflammasome**
A supramolecular complex comprising a pattern recognition receptor (such as NLRP3) and an adaptor protein (such as ASC) that is required for the autocatalytic activation of pro-caspase 1. Active caspase 1 catalyses the proteolytic maturation of interleukin-1β, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine.

**Activation-induced cell death**
After an adaptive immune response, superfluous lymphocytes are eliminated on T cell receptor re-stimulation by a mechanism that may involve the CD95–CD95L system.

**Polyubiquitylation**
The attachment of chains of the small protein ubiquitin to Lys residues of proteins, often as a tag for rapid cellular degradation.

**TNFR1 complex I promotes cell survival.** In the absence of TNF, TNFR1 subunits spontaneously assemble at the plasma membrane to generate trimeric receptors owing to the so-called pre-ligand assembly domain (PLAD), which is localized in the extracellular Cys-rich domain 1 (CRD1) of the protein⁴². On ligand binding, TNFR1 trimers undergo a conformational change that allows the cytosolic portion of the receptor to recruit multiple proteins, including TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD), RIP1, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (cIAP1), cIAP2, TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF5. This membrane-proximal supramolecular structure has been named complex I⁴³ (FIG. 1a). cIAPs — E3 ubiquitin ligases that were previously known as apoptosis inhibitors owing to their ability to interfere with caspase activation⁴⁴ — are recruited (by an amino-terminal domain that contains baculovirus IAP repeats) to complex I by TRAF2, which stabilizes them by preventing their polyubiquitylation⁴⁵,⁴⁶. cIAPs catalyse the addition of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin moieties to Lys377 of RIP1 (REF. 47). Lys63-polyubiquitylated RIP1 provides a docking site for transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2) and TAB3, which together (the TAK1–TAB2–TAB3 complex) constitute the apical stimulator of the canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation pathway (reviewed in REF. 31; BOX 2). NF-κB transactivates cytoprotective genes and facilitates cell survival. Recent results⁴⁸ challenge the common notion that RIP1 constitutes an absolute requirement for NF-κB activation⁴⁹. In some experimental scenarios, complex I constitutes the molecular platform that recruits the ROS-generating NADPH oxidase NOX1 to the plasma membrane, an event that might be involved in the execution of necroptosis¹⁶,¹⁷ (see below). Depending on cell type and lethal trigger, complex I might therefore exert either cytoprotective or cytotoxic functions (through NF-κB activation or NOX1 recruitment, respectively), suggesting that complex I regulates an intricate network of pro-survival and pro-death signalling pathways.

**Initiation of necroptosis: TNFR1 decides**
The most extensively characterized pathway leading to necroptosis is initiated by ligation of TNFR1 (TABLE 1). Depending on the cell type, cell activation state and microenvironment factors, TNF administration can result in cell survival, apoptosis or necroptosis, reflecting an intricate network of signals that operate downstream of TNFR1 and that can ‘switch’ between different patterns of response³² (FIG. 1). In particular, the ubiquitin-editing system and initiator caspases such as caspase 8 modulate the molecular switches that dictate the biological response to TNFR1 activation.

TNFR1 complex II promotes apoptosis or necroptosis. Ligand-bound TNFR1 is internalized, leading to a shift in the molecular composition of the TNFR1 interactome (TABLE 1) and to the formation of a cytosolic death-inducing signalling complex (DISC), better known as complex II (REFS 43,50) (FIG. 1). RIP1 poly-ubiquitylation not only affects NF-κB activation but also influences the transition from complex I to complex II (REFS 10,11,51). On deubiquitylation of RIP1 by the Lys63-deubiquitylating enzyme cylindromatosis (CYLD)¹⁴, RIP1 (together with its cognate kinase RIP3) is recruited to a supramolecular complex that includes TRADD, FAS-associated protein with a death domain (FADD) and caspase 8 (REF. 43). In line with this model, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of CYLD inhibits TNF-induced necroptosis¹⁴. It remains unclear whether other deubiquitylating enzymes, including A20 (also known as TNFAIP3)⁵², cezanne (also known as OTUD7B)⁵³ and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 21 (USP21)⁵⁴, all of which inhibit NF-κB

and TNFR1 ligation results (at least in some cell types)  
in programmed necrosis⁹,¹³. Whether FADD or TRADD  
are strictly required to assemble the necroptosis-  
signalling complex, or ‘necrosome’, is less clear. The  
absence of FADD sensitizes some cells, including Jurkat  
lymphocytes, to necrotic cell death⁹,³⁵. In contrast, MEFs  
isolated from FADD-deficient mice are resistant to  
TNF-induced necroptosis⁵⁷.

Both TNF-induced apoptosis and necroptosis  
(obtained in the presence of the chemical pan-caspase  
inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk) are blocked in TRADD-deficient  
cells⁵⁸, suggesting that, at least in some experimental set-  
tings, TRADD (which is also part of TNFR complex I;  
see above) constitutes an indispensable cell death-  
inducing adaptor protein⁴³. In contrast to these obser-  
vations, TRADD cannot be detected in complex II  
formed on TNFR ligation in the presence of second  
mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC; also  
known as Diablo) mimetics (chemical agents that block  
cIAPs by mimicking the activity of SMAC, a mito-  
chondrial cIAP inhibitor). Moreover, RNAi-mediated  
knockdown of TRADD stimulates (rather than inhibits)  
the formation of complex II in some cell types, suggest-  
ing that TRADD is not required for the assembly and  
function of complex II (REFS 56,59).

**The necrosome signalling complex.** The term necro-  
some refers to a multiprotein complex containing RIP1  
and RIP3 that stimulates necroptosis⁵⁹. The formation  
of the necrosome is highly regulated by ubiquitylation  
(see above) and mutual RIP1 and RIP3 phosphoryla-  
tion (see below). Whereas many cell lines are protected  
against TNF-induced apoptosis by Z-VAD.fmk, others  
respond to TNF plus Z-VAD.fmk by activating necro-  
tosis⁶⁰, a phenomenon that has recently been correlated  
with the expression of RIP3 (REF. 11). RIP3 contains an  
N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal RIP homo-  
typic interaction motif (RHIM), which mediates its  
interaction with RIP1 (REF. 61). Necroptosis induced by  
CD95L, TRAIL or TNF in combination with Z-VAD.fmk  
is abrogated in RIP1-deficient T cells⁹, and enforced  
dimerization of RIP1 can induce necroptosis in FADD-  
deficient Jurkat lymphocytes⁷. Consistent with a role for  
RIP1 in NF-κB-mediated pro-survival signalling, mice  
lacking RIP1 display extensive apoptosis in lymphoid  
and adipose tissues and die 1–3 days after birth⁶². In con-  
trast to RIP1, RIP3 is not involved in NF-κB activation¹⁰.  
Recent experiments with cells that have been stably or  
temporarily depleted of RIP3 showed that this kinase is  
required for necroptosis and revealed the existence of a  
RIP1- and RIP3-containing complex that is assembled  
in response to TNF and is stabilized in the presence of  
SMAC mimetics or caspase inhibitors¹⁰⁻¹².

In 2005, Yuan and colleagues identified necrostatin 1  
and necrostatin 3, small molecules that allosterically  
block the kinase activity of RIP1, thereby inhibiting  
necroptosis but leaving RIP1-mediated activation of  
NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and JUN  
N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) unaffected⁷,⁶³. Several  
other necrostatins have been identified by virtue of  
their capacity to suppress necrosis induced by TNF

activation, also stimulate the lethal functions of RIP1. In  
complex II, caspase 8 inactivates RIP1 and RIP3 by pro-  
teolytic cleavage and initiates the pro-apoptotic caspase  
activation cascade¹¹,⁵⁵. Moreover, genetic or pharmaco-  
logical inhibition of cIAPs prevents RIP1 ubiquitylation  
and favours the formation of complex II, thus sensitiz-  
ing cells to RIP1-dependent activation of caspase 8 and  
apoptosis⁴⁷,⁵⁶. By contrast, when caspase 8 is deleted,  
depleted or inhibited by CrmA or pharmacological  
agents, complex II cannot enter the ‘apoptotic mode’

Box 2 | The NF-κB system

Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) refers to a heterogeneous group of dimeric transcription factors belonging to the REL protein family, which can be activated by tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), pathogens, toxins, drugs and oxidants. In mammals, five NF-κB subunits share a highly conserved REL homology domain (RHD), which mediates dimerization, DNA binding and the interaction with inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) proteins. These subunits are NFKB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NFKB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), cREL, RELA (p65) and RELB<sup>164</sup>. NF-κB homodimers or heterodimers are normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκB proteins.

In the canonical pathway (see the figure, part **a**), the IκB kinase (IKK) complex (composed of one regulatory subunit, IKKγ (also known as NEMO), and two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ) responds to specific signals (including TNFR1 ligation) or nonspecific stress by phosphorylating IκB to target it for destruction by E1–E2–E3-mediated ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation<sup>31</sup>. IκB degradation unmasks the RHD and a nuclear localization signal (NLS; which is common to all REL proteins) on associated NF-κB dimers, allowing them to access the nucleus and bind DNA<sup>31</sup>. The IKK complex is stabilized by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which linearly adds ubiquitin (Ub) moieties to IKKγ<sup>165</sup>.

In the non-canonical pathway (see the figure, part **b**), which responds to a specific set of differentiating or developmental stimuli, the IKK complex comprises IKKα dimers and is activated by NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK)-mediated phosphorylation. In turn, active IKKα phosphorylates p100 to promote its proteolytic processing to p52, which can dimerize with other NF-κB subunits and enter the nucleus.

Once bound to nuclear DNA, NF-κB dimers regulate the expression of genes implicated in a plethora of pathophysiological processes, including innate and adaptive immune responses, inflammation, cell proliferation, cell death and cell survival.

Alterations of the IKK–NF-κB signalling module (most often resulting in constitutive NF-κB activation) contribute to oncogenesis and tumour development in many solid or haematopoietic malignancies<sup>166</sup>. One example is provided by the negative NF-κB regulator cylindromatosis (CYLD), a deubiquitylating enzyme, the loss-of-function mutation of which leads to familial cylindromatosis<sup>167,168</sup>. Moreover, NF-κB activation reduces the apoptotic potential of anticancer chemotherapeutics, thereby favouring resistance<sup>169</sup>. Pharmacological inhibitors of the NF-κB system might therefore directly target oncogene addiction<sup>170</sup> or sensitize tumour cells to chemotherapy. Multiple NF-κB inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical trials, alone or in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy<sup>169</sup>.

#### Oncogene addiction
An expression coined by Weinberg in 2002 (REF. 170) to describe the observation that tumour maintenance often depends on the continued activity of some oncogenes.

plus Z-VAD.fmk, but they inhibit RIP1 indirectly by interfering with upstream signals that are yet to be elucidated^{63–65}. Necrostatin 1 abolishes the assembly of the RIP1–RIP3 complex, suggesting that the kinase activity of RIP1 is required for necrosome formation^{10,11}. Necroptosis depends on a tightly regulated mutual relationship between RIP1 and RIP3 kinase activities, involving the autophosphorylation of RIP1 on Ser161 and direct or indirect RIP3-mediated phosphorylation of RIP1 (REFS 11,63). Recently, murine cytomegalovirus infection was shown to induce RIP3-dependent but RIP1-independent necroptosis^{66}. Moreover, overexpression of catalytically active RIP3 can trigger necroptosis irrespective of the presence of RIP1 (REF. 12). Thus, at least in some cases, RIP1 may not constitute an absolute requirement for necroptosis induction. Altogether, these results point to the existence of a highly complex, tightly regulated signal transduction pathway that connects death receptors to pro-inflammatory, apoptotic or necrotic signal transducers.

**Execution of necroptosis**

Several distinct molecular mechanisms contribute to the execution of TNFR1-initiated necroptosis. Some of these effectors can also be activated by other necrotic triggers, including PAMPs and DNA damage (see above).

**Bioenergetic aspects of the execution of necroptosis**

During apoptosis, ATP-consuming processes including PARP1 activity^{67}, translation^{68} and proteasome-mediated degradation^{69} are rapidly shut off by caspases. By contrast, during TNF-induced necroptosis, these processes persist and hence may contribute to the lethal decline in intracellular ATP^{70}. PARP1 is a nuclear enzyme involved in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation^{71}. The overactivation of PARP1, perhaps due to ROS-mediated DNA damage, is critically involved in the necrotic response of L929 fibrosarcoma cells to TNF^{72} and eventually results in the depletion of ATP and NAD (FIG. 2). In response to DNA alkylation, PARP1 activation and the consequent NAD depletion and/or PAR accumulation stimulates the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, a process that reportedly depends on calpains — Ca²⁺-activated non-caspase Cys proteases^{73–75}. Cytosolic AIF rapidly relocates to the nuclear compartment, where it mediates caspase-independent, large-scale DNA fragmentation^{25}, which in turn can further stimulate PARP activation, thereby initiating a vicious cycle. Harlequin mice, which bear a hypomorphic mutation of *Aifm1* and therefore express reduced amounts of AIF, are protected against several necrotic stimuli, including ischaemia–reperfusion injury of the brain^{76–78}. Similarly, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of PARP1 has consistent cytoprotective effects^{79}.

Surprisingly, both RIP1-deficient and TRAF2-deficient MEFs are resistant to PARP1-induced cell death in response to DNA alkylating agents^{80}, indicating that RIP1 activation can also occur downstream of PARP1, at least in specific experimental settings. In line with this notion,

PARP1 hyperactivation not only causes mitochondrial dysfunction but also activates JNKs, two processes that have been shown to enhance necrotic cell death in some experimental setups^{80,81}. A direct link between RIP1 and decreasing ATP concentrations (which occur during necroptosis) was postulated when the existence of a RIP1-dependent signal that results in the inhibition of adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) was uncovered^{22}. In physiological circumstances, ANT, an integral protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane, exchanges mitochondrially neosynthesized ATP with cytosolic ADP^{25}. Inhibition of ANT by RIP1 can be expected to reduce intramitochondrial ADP levels, leading first to the inhibition of F₁–F₀ ATP synthase (as ADP is its substrate) and then to the reversal of F₁–F₀ ATP synthase activity, which causes the ATP hydrolysis-driven extrusion of protons from the mitochondrial matrix, resulting in a net increase in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (∆ψₘ). This model is apparently corroborated by the fact that mitochondria show transiently increased ∆ψₘ during the early phases of necroptosis^{15,24}.

ANT has also been suggested to interact with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC; present on the outer mitochondrial membrane) and cyclophilin D (CYPD; present in the mitochondrial matrix) to generate the PTPC (reviewed in REF. 25). In response to some lethal triggers, including oxidative stress and Ca²⁺ overload, the PTPC adopts a high conductance conformation, permitting the unregulated entry of solutes and water into the mitochondrial matrix, a phenomenon that has been dubbed the mitochondrial permeability transition^{25}. The PTPC is a highly dynamic entity that interacts with multiple proteins, including pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 protein family^{82}. However, it is not known whether BCL-2-modifying factor (BMF), a BH3-only protein required for TNF-induced necrosis^{14}, functionally or physically interacts with the PTPC. Both pharmacological and genetic interventions aimed at inhibiting backbone components of the PTPC, including VDAC, ANT and CYPD, mediate cytoprotective effects against numerous insults *in vitro* and *in vivo* (reviewed in REFS 25,78). As it stands, CYPD seems to be the leading player of the PTPC, as genetic ablation of peptidylprolyl isomerase F (*Ppif*, the CYPD-encoding gene), but not of the genes coding for all known VDAC and ANT isoforms^{83,84}, consistently protects mice against ischaemic injury of the brain and heart *in vivo*^{20,21}. These results underscore the importance of mitochondrial events in pathological necroptosis.

**ROS and RNS contribute to the execution of necroptosis**

Mitochondrial energy metabolism was first linked to the execution of necrosis in the early 1990s, when the Fiers group showed that ROS production by mitochondrial respiratory complex I is crucial for the necrotic response of L929 cells to TNF^{85}. Mitochondrial ROS also mediate cell death-associated ultrastructural changes of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)^{85,86}. Although ROS production is not essential for all instances of TNF-induced necrosis^{11,86}, the kinase activity of RIP3 may link TNFR1 signalling, mitochondrial bioenergetics

Figure 2 | Execution of necroptosis. When caspase activation is prevented, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1; also known as RIPK1) and RIP3 (also known as RIPK3) are phosphorylated and elicit necroptosis. The RIP1–RIP3 necrosome stimulates glycogenolysis and glutaminolysis by enhancing glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL), glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL) and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1) activity (1), inhibits the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) to deplete cytosolic ATP (2), activates JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated degradation of ferritin, thus increasing the labile iron pool (3), and favours sphingomyelinase (SMase)-mediated generation of ceramide, which is converted into sphingosine by ceramidase and promotes a cytosolic Ca²⁺ wave that activates calpains and cytosolic phospholipase A₂ (cPLA₂; 4). cPLA₂ triggers lipid peroxidation by mobilizing the lipoxygenase substrate arachidonic acid and may be required for SMase-mediated ceramide generation (5). Sphingosine, calpains and lipid hydroperoxides induce lysosome membrane permeabilization (LMP), resulting in the leakage of cytotoxic hydrolases into the cytosol. Oxidative metabolism favours the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the formation of redox-active advanced glycation end products (AGEs; 6). ROS (which also derive from NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1; see FIG. 1), ceramide metabolism and labile iron pool elevation), initiate vicious cycles of damage by exacerbating mitochondrial uncoupling and lipid peroxidation and favour the opening of the permeability-transition pore complex (PTPC; 7). This results in the permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes and the translocation of cytotoxic proteins, including apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol. Alternatively, AIF release can follow a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)–calpain cascade triggered by DNA damage (8). As cytosolic AIF enters the nucleus to exert endonucleolytic functions, and PARP1 overactivation rapidly depletes cytosolic ATP, DNA damage can initiate a feed-forward signalling loop towards necroptosis. Notably, RIP1 can also operate downstream of PARP1 to execute necroptosis.

and ROS overproduction (FIG. 2). RIP3 physically interacts with and allosterically activates several metabolic enzymes, including glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL), glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL) and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1). RNAi-mediated knockdown of any of these enzymes attenuates TNF plus Z-VAD.fmk-mediated ROS production and necrosis¹². PYGL catalyses the breakdown of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate (glycogenolysis), which can be converted into the glycolytic substrate glucose-6-phosphate⁸⁷, thereby stimulating glycolysis (which eventually contributes to ROS generation). The RIP3-mediated necrotic boost on glycogenolysis can also favour the production of methylglyoxal, a cytotoxic compound for which the synthetic rate is proportional to glycolytic flux⁸⁸. Methylglyoxal covalently binds to proteins and

forms advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which alter protein function and constitute new centres of sustained ROS generation<sup>88</sup>. Mitochondrial proteins seem to be particularly prone to methylglyoxal-mediated post-translational modifications<sup>89</sup>. Thus, inhibition of glycolysis reportedly attenuates cell death by apoptosis and necroptosis (as both these processes are stimulated by ROS), whereas the blockage of methylglyoxal-detoxifying pathways accelerates it<sup>88</sup>. Both GLUL, a cytosolic enzyme that condensates glutamate and free ammonia into Glu, and GLUD1, a mitochondrial enzyme that converts glutamate to α-ketoglutarate, are required for glutaminolysis (reviewed in REF. 90). Glutaminolysis results in the generation of α-ketoglutarate, which feeds into the Krebs cycle to generate reduced equivalents and pyruvate (by malate decarboxylase), in turn favouring lactate accumulation<sup>90</sup>. Moreover, mitochondrial Glu catabolism increases the local concentration of ammonia, thus facilitating ROS generation by the respiratory chain<sup>91</sup>. Altogether, there seem to be several mechanisms by which enhanced glycogenolysis, glycolysis and glutaminolysis can contribute to the respiratory burst that characterizes necrotic cell death.

Non-mitochondrial ROS production by the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase NOX1 (which is recruited by RIP1) also contributes to TNF-induced necrotic cell death<sup>16</sup>. NOX1 activation is dependent on riboflavin kinase, which physically bridges the TNFR1 death domain and p22phox (also known as CYBA), the common subunit of multiple NADPH oxidases<sup>17</sup>. NOX1 is activated within minutes of the administration of TNF, and it is possible that NOX1-generated ROS trigger or sustain the subsequent production of ROS by the mitochondrial respiratory chain<sup>92</sup>. ROS generation is auto-amplified through several reactions. For instance, interaction of hydrogen peroxide with the superoxide anion in the Haber–Weiss reaction or with ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) ions in the Fenton reaction generates the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, further promoting lipid peroxidation<sup>28</sup>. Interestingly, whereas low levels of ROS can favour a mild mitochondrial uncoupling that is detrimental to ATP synthesis but exerts cytoprotective effects<sup>93</sup>, ROS overgeneration engages the respiratory chain in a potentially lethal vicious cycle that also entails the generation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS)<sup>94</sup> (see below). Similar to mitochondrial ROS, NOX1-derived ROS are not a requisite for necroptosis, as shown by the fact that small interfering RNA-mediated downregulation of NOX1 almost abrogates TNF-induced ROS generation but only marginally rescues L929 fibrosarcoma cells from necrosis<sup>16</sup>. Accordingly, ROS scavengers such as tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (BHA) exert anti-necroptotic effects in some (but not all) experimental settings<sup>95,96</sup>. Thus, the relative contribution of ROS from distinct sources to necroptosis may be dictated by the cell type.

TNF also stimulates ROS formation by favouring JNK1-dependent degradation of the ubiquitous iron-binding protein ferritin, resulting in an increase in the labile iron pool<sup>97</sup>. Redox-active iron is a threat to cells and needs to be cautiously transported and stored in an inactive form<sup>98</sup>. Ferritin-deficient cells (in which the iron storage capacity is reduced) are more resistant to TNF-induced labile iron pool elevation, ROS generation and necroptosis than their wild-type counterparts<sup>99</sup>. Intriguingly, RIP1-deficient MEFs also failed to elevate the labile iron pool on TNF administration<sup>99</sup>, suggesting that RIP1 might modulate the induction of ROS through an effect on ferritin. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the possible implication of RIP1 remain to be elucidated.

At low intracellular concentrations, nitric oxide functions as a second messenger in a myriad of signalling pathways. If overproduced, nitric oxide is highly toxic and leads to the generation of RNS with distinctive chemical and biological properties<sup>100</sup>. Similar to ROS, RNS are potent oxidants and can initiate or propagate lipid<sup>101</sup> and protein oxidation and peroxidation<sup>102</sup>. Recently, nitration has been shown to elicit RIP1- and RIP3-mediated necroptosis, with respiratory complex I subunit NDUFB8 being involved<sup>103</sup>. This is apparently in contrast with the well-known cytoprotective effects of nitrite, which attenuates oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage and dysfunction, hypothermia, tissue infarction and organismal death in a murine model of TNF-induced shock<sup>104</sup>. Nitrites also confer protection against ischaemia-reperfusion injuries *in vivo*, presumably owing to nitrite-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial ROS generation<sup>105</sup> or to an effect on the soluble guanylate cyclase α1 subunit, one of the main intracellular receptors for nitric oxide and signal transducers in the cardiovascular system<sup>104</sup>.

**Involvement of LMP in the execution of necroptosis.**  
ROS can react with polyunsaturated fatty acids in cellular membranes to generate reactive aldehydes (such as 4-hydroxynonenal), which in turn can attack protein and lipid moieties in membranes, thereby compromising their integrity<sup>106</sup>. In mitochondria, the products of lipid peroxidation inhibit oxidative phosphorylation, compromise the permeability of the inner membrane, dissipate the Δψ<sub>m</sub> and reduce the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering capacity, thus contributing to necrosis<sup>107</sup>. Lipid peroxidation-mediated destabilization of cellular membranes (including the plasma, lysosomal and ER membranes) results in a leakage of proteases or an elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, two phenomena that participate in necrotic cell death.

Lysosomes are the only intracellular compartment in which redox-active iron temporarily resides before it is incorporated into the catalytic centre of specific enzymes or stored in ferritin<sup>108</sup>. Typically, the Fenton reaction is favoured in the lumen of lysosomes, not only because lysosomes are enriched in reduced iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) and reducing equivalents (provided by Cys, ascorbic acid and reduced glutathione), but also because they are permeable to hydrogen peroxide and lack hydrogen peroxide-detoxifying enzymes, such as catalases and glutathione peroxidases<sup>108</sup>. Accordingly, oxidative stress-induced lipid peroxidation, LMP and cell death can be prevented by the iron chelator desferrioxamine<sup>24,109</sup>.

Cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (cPLA<sub>2</sub>) and ceramide also act upstream of lipid peroxidation to stimulate LMP. PLA<sub>2</sub> is an esterase that produces arachidonic acid from

The product of a chain of chemical reactions that most often is initiated by non-enzymatic protein glycosylation. Increased extracellular glucose favours the accumulation of AGEs, which interact with specific receptors on the plasma membrane to stimulate the generation of intracellular ROS.

### Haber–Weiss reaction
The generation of hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide and superoxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> → OH<sup>•</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup> + O<sub>2</sub>). The reaction is very slow, but is catalysed by ferric ions (Fe<sup>3+</sup>).

The ferrous ion (Fe<sup>2+</sup>)-dependent decomposition of dihydrogen peroxide, generating the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (Fe<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> → Fe<sup>3+</sup> + OH<sup>•</sup> + OH<sup>−</sup>).

### Lipid peroxidation
The biochemical reaction whereby free radicals ‘steal’ electrons from lipids in cell membranes, resulting in ultrastructural damage to organelles.

### Labile iron pool
A cytosolic fraction of iron ions loosely bound to macromolecules (for example, ferritin) — also known as a chelatable iron pool — that harbours the metabolically active (and hence potentially toxic) forms of ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) and ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) ions.

arachidonate-containing phospholipids$^{110}$. Treatment of L929 cells with TNF leads to PLA$_{2}$ activation, and overexpression of cPLA$_{2}$ sensitizes TNF-resistant L929 variants to necroptosis$^{111}$. Arachidonic acid is converted by lipoxygenase into membrane-damaging lipid hydroperoxides$^{23}$ (FIG. 2). In response to TNF, both the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) and its neutral counterpart at the plasma membrane (nSMase) transform sphingomyelin into ceramide, which in turn can be converted to sphingosine by ceramidase$^{112}$. Sphingosine has been characterized as a lysosomotropic LMP inducer (see below)$^{113}$. Depending on the specific experimental setting (the cell type or lethal trigger), ceramide can induce either apoptosis or necroptosis$^{114}$. Isoform-specific pharmacological inhibition of nSMase protects breast cancer MCF7 cells against TNF-induced apoptosis$^{115}$. Notably, both $RIPK1^{-/-}$ human Jurkat lymphocytes and cPLA$_{2}$-deficient murine L929 cells fail to accumulate ceramide on TNF administration and are protected against TNF-induced necroptosis, suggesting that RIP1, as well as cPLA$_{2}$, might be required for SMase-mediated generation of ceramide and consequent cell death$^{96}$.

A connection between Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis and LMP was first suggested by the observation that TNF induces a moderate increase in intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations, resulting in the generation of enlarged lysosomes that are particularly prone to LMP$^{116}$. In some experimental settings, for example *in vivo* during the neuronal response to ischaemia–reperfusion, lysosomal membranes can be destabilized by calpains$^{78,117}$. Calpain-mediated LMP results in the cytosolic spillage of lysosomal hydrolases such as proteases of the cathepsin family, which play an important part during necrotic cell death$^{118}$. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibitors of cathepsins confer consistent neuroprotection *in vivo*$^{119}$. Importantly, calpain has also been shown to proteolytically inactivate the plasma membrane Na$^{+}$–Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger, thereby engaging a positive feedback loop of self-activation mediated by the irreversible accumulation of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ (REF. 120).

Additional evidence showing the important role of LMP in necrotic cell death has been provided by the genetic manipulation of 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70), a guardian of lysosomal membrane integrity$^{121}$. HSP70 specifically interacts with the endolysosomal anionic phospholipid bis(monoacylglycero) phosphate$^{121}$ and may also constitute the lysosomal target of calpain-mediated proteolysis on its ROS-mediated carbonylation$^{118}$. HSP70 delays LMP and necrosis induced by TNF, heat shock or oxidative stress$^{122-124}$. In response to an ischaemic insult, mitochondria from HSP70-overexpressing cells exhibit reduced levels of ROS production and lipid peroxidation$^{125}$. Whether this represents a primary effect of HSP70 on LMP, mitochondrial membranes or iron homeostasis$^{124}$ is not yet clear.

### Disposal of necrotic cells

When confronted with cell death, the immune system clears corpses, stimulates the replacement of lost cells, alerts host defences if infectious agents are detected and possibly eliminates cells approaching oncogenic transformation. The type and nature of dying cells, the history

inflammatory cytokines<sup>133</sup>. These findings reveal an unexpected complexity in the interaction between necrotic cells and the phagocytic system.

In spite of these caveats, it must be noted that necrotic cells can release multiple pro-inflammatory factors, including the alarmin SAP130, heat-shock proteins (such as HSP70, HSP90 and GP96), histones, high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) and several non-proteinaceous factors (such as RNA, DNA and monosodium urate microcrystals), all of which act on different PRRs on immune effector cells to activate inflammatory reactions (reviewed in REF. 126). Histones released from necrotic cells have a major pathogenic role in sepsis, and their neutralization by antibodies or activated protein C can prevent organismal lethality<sup>142</sup>. Recently, mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including N-formylated peptides and mitochondrial DNA, were found to be released by necrotic cells into the circulation and to contribute to neutrophil-mediated organ injury similarly to bacterial PAMPs<sup>143</sup>, underscoring an evolutionarily conserved link between distinct routes to innate immunity.

Recent genetic manipulations suggest an important role for necrosis in the outcome of viral infections and immunosurveillance. *Ripk3*<sup>−/−</sup> mice fail to control vaccinia virus infection, because virus-elicited necrosis can limit viral replication and/or stimulate the antiviral immune response<sup>10</sup>. Intriguingly, some viral genomes encode inhibitors of necrotic cell death that may facilitate their propagation and their subversion of the immune response. For example, murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) expresses the proteins M36 and M45, which inhibit caspase 8-mediated apoptosis<sup>144</sup> and RIP1- and RIP3-mediated necroptosis<sup>145</sup>, respectively. We suspect that multiple virus-encoded necrosis-inhibitory factors will be discovered as the comprehension of signalling events in necroptosis advances.

It has not been investigated in detail whether necrotic cell death might exert a tumour-suppressive function like apoptotic cell death does. However, mice lacking CYLD (which is required for TNF-induced necrosis)<sup>14</sup> are highly susceptible to developing a wide array of tumours, including skin and colon cancers<sup>146,147</sup>. It remains to be determined whether CYLD merely acts as a cell-autonomous tumour suppressor or whether it is required for stimulating immunosurveillance, and whether these effects can be attributed to its role in necroptosis or NF-κB signalling.

### Pathophysiological facets of necroptosis

Necrosis can occur in a programmed manner during development (for example, the death of chondrocytes controlling the longitudinal growth of bones)<sup>148</sup> and in adult tissue homeostasis (for example, in intestinal epithelial cells)<sup>149</sup>. Moreover, cells in which apoptosis-associated caspase activation has been blocked often succumb to necrosis in response to the same stimuli that would usually induce apoptosis. Thus, interdigital cells or thymocytes from apoptotic peptidase-activating factor 1 (*Apaf1*<sup>−/−</sup>) embryos or adult mice, respectively, undergo necrotic cell death to the same extent and with the same timing as cells from wild-type mice would undergo apoptosis<sup>150</sup>. Nonetheless, necrosis is mostly associated with pathological conditions, including neurodegeneration, ischaemia–reperfusion and infection. Excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, all of which contribute to the execution of necroptosis (see above), are indeed implicated in stroke as well as in Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinson’s diseases (reviewed in REF. 151). The ageing brain accumulates iron, copper and zinc, resulting in increased oxidative stress by the Fenton reaction, which contributes to necrotic cell death<sup>152</sup>. Accordingly, iron chelation and ROS scavenging may delay the manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases<sup>109</sup>. Intriguingly, necroptosis has recently emerged as a prominent antiviral mechanism, as shown by the fact that *Ripk3*<sup>−/−</sup> mice are more susceptible to viral infection than their wild-type counterparts<sup>10</sup>, and by the existence of viral factors that contain the RHIM domain and interfere with the RIP1–RIP3 interaction<sup>66</sup>.

*Ripk1*<sup>−/−</sup> mice are not viable<sup>62</sup>, and tissue-specific knockout and kinase-dead knock-in models will be required to elucidate the contribution of RIP1 to pathological cell loss. Pharmacological RIP inhibitors, including the RIP1-specific agent necrostatin 1 and geldanamycin (which downregulates RIP1, RIP3 and several other HSP90 client proteins)<sup>10,153</sup>, exert cytoprotective effects *in vitro* in several distinct experimental settings (Supplementary information S2 (table)). Intriguingly, in some cell types, geldanamycin induces a switch from TNF-induced necroptosis to apoptosis<sup>154</sup>. The inhibition of RIP1 kinase activity also attenuates neurodegenerative diseases<sup>155</sup>, brain ischaemia<sup>7</sup>, myocardial infarction<sup>156</sup> and head trauma<sup>157</sup> *in vivo* (Supplementary information S3 (table)), underscoring the contribution of RIP1 to pathological cell death. Similarly, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of PARP1, CYPD, cPLA<sub>2</sub> or RIP3 limits cell loss *in vivo* in several rodent models of injury (Supplementary information S3 (table) and Supplementary information S4 (table)). *Parp1*<sup>−/−</sup> mice are protected from haemorrhagic shock<sup>158</sup>, acute pancreatitis and consequent lung injury<sup>159</sup>. Mice lacking CYPD are more resistant to ischaemia–reperfusion damage of the brain<sup>21</sup> and the heart<sup>20</sup> than their wild-type counterparts. Similarly, cPLA<sub>2</sub>-deficient mice exhibit reduced injury after brain ischaemia<sup>160</sup>. Finally, cerulein-induced pancreatic acinar cell loss and pancreatitis are greatly reduced in *Ripk3*<sup>−/−</sup> mice<sup>11,12</sup>. Altogether, these results support the idea that specific inhibitors of RIP1, RIP3, PARP1, CYPD and cPLA<sub>2</sub> can attenuate pathological cell loss *in vivo* in rodent models of human disease.

### Problems and perspectives

Necroptosis can be conceived as a partially programmed event of cellular explosion. Physiological signals or cellular damage are perceived by specific receptors or sensors that ignite a detonator, which in turn activates the blasting agent. It is important to accurately distinguish and molecularly identify the upstream signals — the detonator and the explosives — for several important reasons.
First, the elucidation of the precise molecular hierarchy involved in different cell death scenarios may clarify whether one ‘core programme’ or several independent pathways of necrosis exist. Undoubtedly, there are different ways to induce necrosis, be it through the activation of specific receptors or by inflicting distinct types of cellular damage. However, it is still debatable whether the core features of necrosis (such as RIP1 activation, bioenergetic and redox crisis, and lysosomal and mitochondrial perturbation) are built in a single interdependent circuit or several independent, mutually stimulatory (self-amplifying) circuits. Understanding this is important for the development of necroptosis-inhibitory cytoprotective drugs. The existence of several distinct pathways that ignite necrosis would imply that they all need to be interrupted simultaneously for cytoprotection, suggesting the need for combination therapies. Although this has not been addressed systematically, it may be beneficial to combine cytoprotective agents that target different lethal subroutines (for example, apoptosis and necroptosis) and processes (for example, LMP and the mitochondrial permeability transition) for optimal therapeutic results.

Second, upstream signals (as opposed to downstream effectors) may constitute better targets for the specific pharmacological suppression of unwarranted cell death. The interception of a pro-necrotic signal transduction pathway would be more efficient if it occurred at an early step, for instance at the level of TNF–TNFR1 interaction, rather than downstream. Moreover, the interruption of specific (stimulus-dependent) pro-necrotic signals should decrease negative side effects. As has previously been shown for several components of the apoptotic machinery (reviewed in REF. 161), necrosis-relevant molecules and processes have ‘day jobs’ and hence exert physiological functions, in particular in the response to cell stress and infection and in immune or inflammatory responses, that should not be perturbed.

Third, downstream signals, which are usually (but not always) activated late in the pathway (when the initial signalling cascade has already been engaged), are also attractive therapeutic targets, as (at least in some settings) they could be blocked after the primary lesion (such as stroke, trauma, infarction and sepsis).

Although intercepting upstream signals is the most desirable therapeutic choice, early interventions are rarely (if ever) achievable in the treatment of, for example, patients with stroke and trauma. Moreover, targeting downstream events is desirable when the upstream signals are not uniform or when they are transduced by multiple, interconnected pathways. These considerations underscore the importance of appropriately dissecting the chronological and functional aspects of necrotic demolition and defining the exact ‘point of no return’ beyond which cytoprotection can no longer be achieved.

Fourth, cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, the cell death-inducing activity of which can contribute to the pathophysiology of human diseases, including AIDS and autoimmune disorders, reportedly ‘overkill’ their targets by transferring multiple proteases and membrane-permeabilizing proteins into them, thereby triggering both apoptotic and necrotic programmes. Thus, rescuing targets from this type of cytotoxic attack may require a multipronged strategy that is yet to be optimized.

Fifth, multiple cancer cell lines display an altered propensity to undergo necroptosis, which, at least partially, correlates with the expression levels of RIP3 (REF. 11). Further work is required to elucidate the importance of this finding *in vivo* and, in particular, whether it would be possible to stimulate the necrotic demise of RIP3-proficient tumour cells to circumvent apoptosis resistance. It is also unknown whether, and which, necrotic pathways might elicit immunogenic tumour cell death and hence ignite a highly desirable anticancer immune response that would eliminate residual tumour (stem) cells.

We anticipate that resolving these questions will help in the design of cytoprotective and cytotoxic therapies, with important implications for neuroprotection, cardioprotection, organ preservation and cancer therapy. Although the molecular exploration of programmed necrosis is still in its infancy, it is clear that interrupting pro-necrotic signals may prevent pathological cell loss in many human diseases. In this respect, the development of necrostatins⁶³ may have paved the way for the development of a new class of potentially powerful therapeutic agents for clinical applications.

12. Zhang, D. W. *et al*. RIP3, an energy metabolism regulator that switches TNF-induced cell death from apoptosis to necrosis. *Science* **325**, 332–336 (2009). References 10–12 independently uncovered the obligate role of RIP3 in necroptosis. By multiple experimental approaches, RIP3 was shown to functionally and physically interact with RIP1, leading to a mitochondrial metabolic burst that underlies necroptosis execution. The pathophysiological role of RIP3 *in vivo* was substantiated by animal models of viral infection and acute pancreatitis.

The sensitivity of murine L929 fibrosarcoma cells to TNF-induced necrosis was dramatically increased by expression of a serpin-like viral protein (CrmA) and by pharmacological caspase inhibitors, showing for the first time a major role for caspases in the apoptosis–necrosis switch.

14. Hitomi, J. *et al.* Identification of a molecular signaling network that regulates a cellular necrotic cell death pathway. *Cell* **135**, 1311–1323 (2008).

The first time systems biology was applied to compare necroptosis to apoptosis in murine cells. Genome wide RNAi-based screens coupled to *in silico* and *in vitro* analyses allowed the delineation of a signalling network that regulates the molecular bifurcation between necroptosis and apoptosis.

References 20 and 21 show that CYPD-deficient mice are protected against ischaemic insults, as compared to their wild-type littermates. Moreover, multiple types of primary cells isolated from *Ppif⁻/⁻* mice exhibit enhanced resistance to necrotic (but not apoptotic) stimuli. Together, these studies provide unequivocal evidence that CYPD regulates necroptosis *in vivo*.
