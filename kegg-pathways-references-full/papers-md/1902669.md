### SUMMARY:
New catalytic functions of human carbonyl- and aldose reductase in tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis are proposed. 6-Pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, was converted to 6-lactoyl tetrahydropterin and 1′-hydroxy-2′-oxopropyl tetrahydropterin by carbonyl reductase under anaerobic conditions. 1′-Hydroxy-2′-oxopropyl tetrahydropterin was subsequently metabolized to tetrahydrobiopterin by aldose reductase. Based on these results, alternative pathways for the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin in patients with genetic defects of sepiapterin reductase are suggested.

### INTRODUCTION:
The biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH₄) involves several enzymatic steps. This includes the reduction of 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin (PPH₄) to 1′-hydroxy-2′-oxopropyl tetrahydropterin (2′-oxo-PH₄) by sepiapterin reductase and the reduction of PPH₄ to 6-lactoyl tetrahydropterin (LPH₄) by aldose reductase (AR, formerly named PPH₄ reductase) (1–9). Both tetrahydropterins are further reduced to BH₄ by sepiapterin reductase. BH₄ is the cofactor for the monooxygenases which hydroxylate phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan to the precursors of the catecholamine and indoleamine neurotransmitters (10). A deficiency of BH₄ is known to cause hyperphenylalaninemia leading to abnormal development of newborns. Three enzyme defects have been identified that lead to BH₄ deficiency (11, 12); these are a deficiency in GTP cyclohydrolase I, PPH₄ synthase, and dihydropteridine reductase. Thus far, a sepiapterin reductase deficiency in newborns has not been reported, which could be due to: (a) sepiapterin reductase deficiency does not allow a fetus to survive, or (b) sepiapterin reductase deficiency is

compensated by other reductases with similar properties. Our results strongly support the second hypothesis suggesting new catalytic functions of carbonyl- and aldose reductases in BH₄ biosynthesis.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

BH₄ and sepiapterin were purchased from Dr. B. Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). 7,8-Dihydroneopterin triphosphate (NH₂TP) was prepared using E. coli GTP cyclohydrolase immobilized to affinity support (13). LPH₄ and 2'-oxo-PH₄ standards were prepared following the methods described (14, 15). Catalase (beef liver), glucose oxidase (Aspergillus niger), and NADPH were from Boehringer Mannheim, FRG.

**Preparation of enzymes:** Aldose- and carbonyl reductase were purified as described elsewhere (16, 17). Sepiapterin reductase was partially purified from human brain according to the method described previously (18). For each enzyme preparation, the absence of the other two reductases was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies prepared against aldose reductase (19), carbonyl reductase (16), and sepiapterin reductase (20). PPH₄ synthase was purified from salmon liver (21).

**Analysis of tetrahydropterins by HPLC with electrochemical detection and the preparation of the substrate, PPH₄,** were performed as described previously (16) with modifications: The standard reaction mixture was 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mM dithioerythritol, 8 mM MgCl₂, 14.5 μM NH₂TP, 2 mU PPH₄ synthase, and 2 mM NADPH. Anaerobic conditions were generated by adding 10 mM glucose, glucose oxidase (150 units/ml), and catalase (>5000 units/ml) to the reaction mixture. PPH₄, generated *in situ*, was used without further purification.

2'-Oxo-PH₄ and LPH₄ were prepared by addition of sepiapterin reductase (0.45 mU/ml reaction mixture), and aldose reductase (0.126 mU/ml reaction mixture), to the reaction mixture described above. The mixtures were incubated for 90 min at 37.5°C, and filtered through an Amicon centrifuge concentrator (Centricon-3) to remove the enzymes. All the preparations were made fresh just before use.

**Enzyme assays:** Enzyme activities using sepiapterin as a substrate were assayed using HPLC with fluorescence detection (22). Enzyme activities using PPH₄ as a substrate were measured as follows: The reaction mixture of PPH₄ (see above) and enzyme in a total volume of 100 μl was prepared in autosampler vials, flushed with nitrogen, sealed and incubated at 37.5°C. Reactions were terminated by chilling in ice cold water and samples were immediately injected to HPLC. BH₄ was used as an external standard to quantify LPH₄ and 2'-oxo-PH₄. Enzyme activities with LPH₄ and 2'-oxo-PH₄ as substrates were assayed in reaction mixtures supplemented with NADPH, dithioerythritol, glucose, glucose oxidase, and catalase to the final concentrations as described in the preparation of PPH₄. Enzyme units are defined as μmol product generated per minute.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In an attempt to purify sepiapterin reductase from human brain, another enzyme was co-purified which also used sepiapterin as a substrate but with biochemical properties different from sepiapterin reductase. Gel permeation chromatography of a highly purified preparation of this enzyme yielded a single peak of enzyme activity with a molecular weight of 32,000 (Fig. 1). This enzyme was identified as human carbonyl reductase by several criteria including Western blot analysis using antibodies against the three major low molecular weight human aldo-keto reductases distinguished by different pI's (19). Table 1 lists the specific activity of this enzyme.

**Figure 1. Gel permeation chromatography of carbonyl reductase.** The enzyme was prepared from human brain extracts (350 g of cortex) by ammonium sulfate fractionation (40-55 %), and consecutive chromatography on Matrex-Red A (Amicon), DEAE-Sephadex A50 (Pharmacia), Affigel-Blue (Bio-rad), and Serotonin agarose (Sigma). The final sample (102 mU) was applied to a Sephadex G-150SF (Pharmacia) column (2.6x94 cm) and eluted with 20 mM potassium phosphate, 200 mM KCl, pH 6.8. Fractions (5.8 ml) were collected every hour and assayed for protein and activity to sepiapterin as described in "Materials and Methods". Fractions with activity were pooled, concentrated by using ultrafiltration (Amicon), and stored at -20°C.

preparation compared with those of carbonyl reductase from human brain. The rates of reduction of sepiapterin by sepiapterin- and carbonyl reductase are comparable. However, when menadione was used as a substrate they were about five hundred-fold lower for both enzymes. Nevertheless, when human brain extract was incubated with antibodies against carbonyl reductase, sepiapterin

reduction was inhibited more than 30% (data not shown), indicating that carbonyl reductase significantly contributes to the total sepiapterin reductase activity of human brain.

These findings encouraged us to examine a possible catalytic function of carbonyl reductases in the conversion of PPH₄, the natural substrate of mammalian sepiapterin reductase. In the presence of the enzymatic oxygen-depleting system used to measure the synthesis of tetrahydropterins from PPH₄, two major peaks of enzymatic products were found by HPLC. These two peaks were identified as LPH₄ and 2'-oxo-PH₄, by comparison with reference compounds. The identity of the two compounds was further verified by adding sepiapterin reductase to the assay mixture. In keeping with the known substrate specificity of this enzyme, both products were completely converted to BH₄ (Fig 2A). The results of PPH₄ reduction by carbonyl- and aldose reductase are summarized in Table 1. In agreement with our earlier report (9), LPH₄ was the only product of aldose reductase-mediated PPH₄ reduction. In contrast, carbonyl reductase catalyzed the reduction of both the 1'- and 2'-oxo group of PPH₄ although LPH₄ was the prevailing product. Consistently, small amounts of BH₄ (which increased with the incubation time) were detectable in the assay mixture. Similar BH₄ production was also noticed with aldose reductase as catalyst, as well as in the control experiments (absence of the enzyme). Moreover, when carbonyl reductase (0.03 mU) was incubated with either LPH₄ or 2'-oxo PPH₄, no BH₄ was produced.

The carbonyl reductase-catalyzed reduction of PPH₄ was stimulated by DTE with a markedly more pronounced effect on the synthesis of 2'-oxo PPH₄. At concentrations of 1 and 5 mM DTE, the production of 2'-oxo-PH₄ was increased by 186%, and 215%, whereas the LPH₄ level was increased by 125%, and 120%, respectively. The effect of DTE probably reflects the known sensitivity of carbonyl reductase to sulfhydryl reagents (17). This does not explain, however, the differential stimulation of LPH₄ and 2'-oxo-PH₄ production. N-acetyl serotonin, an inhibitor of sepiapterin reductase, only slightly inhibited carbonyl reductase. At 5 mM, a concentration which completely inhibits rat sepiapterin reductase, carbonyl reductase was still 80% active.

Aldose reductase, in addition to converting PPH₄ to LPH₄, also catalyzed the reduction of 2'-oxo-PH₄ to BH₄, as demonstrated in Fig. 2B. In the presence of carbonyl reductase, an alternative pathway converting PPH₄ to BH₄ in the absence of sepiapterin reductase could be functional *in vivo*. The plausibility of this pathway *in vitro* is documented in Fig. 2C. 2'-Oxo-PH₄ synthesized by carbonyl reductase was selectively and completely converted to BH₄ by aldose reductase. The concomitant decrease of LPH₄, on the other hand, reflects the instability of this compound rather than its enzymatic reduction as verified by a control incubation in the absence of aldose reductase.

The biological significance of the alternative pathway *in vivo* is difficult to estimate. On the one hand, human brain contains large amounts of aldose (25) and carbonyl (17) reductases, which are both found at similar locations throughout the brain. On the other hand, only a small portion of PPH₄ is converted to 2'-oxo-PH₄ by carbonyl reductase and the rate of reduction is much lower than that of sepiapterin reductase. Therefore, in BH₄ deficiency caused by a putative genetic

PPH₄ was incubated with either carbonyl reductase (0.39 mU/ml reaction mixture) (A,C) or low concentrations of sepiapterin reductase (B) as indicated in "Materials and Methods". After ultrafiltration (Amicon), sepiapterin reductase (0.45 mU) was added to filtrate A and aldose reductase (0.07 mU) to filtrate B and C. Controls without addition of the second enzyme were routinely included. At times indicated (20 min for controls), aliquots were subjected for HPLC on (4.6 x 250 mm) ODS1 Spherisorb column (Stagroma, Switzerland) using 6.6 mM sodium hydrogenphosphate, 13.3 mM citric acid, 0.06 mM EDTA, 1.4 mM octanesulfonic acid, 0.16 mM DTE and 5% methanol as solvent (1 ml/min) and electrochemical detection at a sensitivity of 5nA.

Residual sepiapterin reductase which preferentially catalyzes the reduction of the 1'-oxo group, could produce enough 2'-oxo-PH₄ to serve as a substrate of aldose reductase and also convert LPH₄ produced from PPH₄ by the action of aldose reductase and carbonyl reductase to BH₄. In this case, the decreased activity of sepiapterin reductase might be fully compensated by aldose- and carbonyl reductase.

In the case of a complete deficiency of sepiapterin reductase, BH₄ could only be synthesized by the concerted action of aldose- and carbonyl reductases or by any other hitherto unidentified enzyme catalyzing the reduction of the various tetrahydropterins:


CR
PPH₄ -----------------> 2'-oxo-PH₄ -----------------> BH₄
AR


Further investigations using antibodies against human sepiapterin reductase will be initiated in order to clarify the significance of the proposed alternative pathway and the potential for a genetic deficiency of sepiapterin reductase.
