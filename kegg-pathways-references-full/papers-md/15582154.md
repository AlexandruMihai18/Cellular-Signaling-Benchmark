### Abstract

ΔFosB is a unique transcription factor that plays an essential role in long-term adaptive changes in the brain associated with diverse conditions, such as drug addiction, Parkinson’s disease, depression, and antidepressant treatment. It is induced in brain, in a region- and cell-type-specific manner by many types of chronic perturbations. Once induced, it persists for long periods of time due to its unusual stability. The transcriptional effects of ΔFosB are complex, because the protein can function as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. Progress has been made in identifying specific target genes for ΔFosB and in relating some of these genes to ΔFosB’s cellular and behavioral actions. Future studies will help us to better understand the biochemical basis of ΔFosB’s unique stability, as well as the precise molecular pathways through which this transcription factor produces its complex effects on neuronal plasticity and complex behavior.

One of the most intriguing questions in neurobiology is how the brain undergoes long-term adaptive changes that lead to positive processes such as learning and memory or treatment of disease, or negative adaptations that cause, for example, drug addiction or depression. It has been known for some time that the regulation of gene expression is an important component in neuronal plasticity. Several transcription factors have been implicated in this regulation. The focus of this review is on one particular transcription factor, ΔFosB, which appears to be a particularly important agent for long-term modifications in the nervous system.

#### 1. Biochemical properties of ΔFosB

The Fos-Jun family of proteins forms the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex that binds AP-1 sites (consensus sequence: TGAC/GTCA) in gene promoters [36]. Genes encoding Fos and Jun family proteins are termed immediate early genes, because they are induced very rapidly in response to a variety of stimuli. This expression is transient, with mRNA and protein levels returning to normal within a few hours.

About 10 years ago, a broad band of Fos-like proteins, originally termed “chronic FRAs” (Fos-related antigens), was identified by immunoblotting as proteins induced specifically by more chronic treatments [29,30]. These proteins of 35–37 kDa were not seen with several acute treatments but were induced to high levels after chronic administration of the same stimulus. Additionally, these proteins were shown to persist in brain for an extended period of time (weeks to months) compared with all other known Fos and Jun family members (which persist for several hours) [10,15,16,22,28–30,33,35,40,41,46]. Later it was determined that these chronic FRAs are actually isoforms of ΔFosB [16,25], a truncated splice variant of FosB, which lacks 101 amino acids from the C-terminal end of the full-length protein [37]. These unique temporal properties of ΔFosB, as compared with other family proteins, are depicted in Fig. 1.

only by acute treatments and has a short half-life. The 35- to 37-kDa isoforms, which are unique to chronic treatment conditions, presumably contain posttranslational modifications that are potentially related to the unusually high protein stability seen with these isoforms. Indeed, the half-life of these proteins increases as the apparent \( M_r \) increases, with the 37-kDa form having the longest half-life of the three isoforms. Pulse-chase experiments in cultured cells have recently confirmed directly that ΔFosB has an unusually long half-life compared with full-length FosB and other Fos family proteins [52].

The nature of the biochemical modifications that are responsible for this unusually high protein stability is unclear, but at least three mechanisms may be at play. First, recent work has shown that ΔFosB is phosphorylated on specific serine residues by several protein kinases, and that deletion of these sites destabilizes the protein in cell culture assays [52]. Indirect evidence for the importance of phosphorylation mechanisms in ΔFosB’s stability is the finding that induction of the 35- to 37-kDa ΔFosB isoforms is attenuated in mice lacking DARPP-32 [27], a protein phosphatase inhibitor which normally enhances the phosphorylation state of numerous proteins. Second, it is possible that the C-terminus of the FosB protein, which is missing from ΔFosB, is involved in destabilization of the full-length protein. Indeed, the terminal 21 amino acids in FosB is shared by all other Fos family proteins except ΔFosB, and deletion of this motif from FosB increases the protein’s stability [12]. Third, the predominant binding partner for ΔFosB is JunD [15,26], which raises the theoretical possibility, not yet investigated, that heterodimerization with JunD confers still additional stability on resulting AP-1 complexes. Because ΔFosB is so stable and is induced specifically by chronic treatments, we have proposed that ΔFosB may function as a sustained molecular switch, which mediates some of the more persistent adaptations of the brain in response to chronic perturbations [31,38].

## 2. Induction of ΔFosB in the nervous system

Several types of chronic perturbation have been shown to induce the 35- to 37-kDa isoforms of ΔFosB in the brain, with each type of stimulus showing region-specific patterns of induction (Table 1). Virtually all drugs of abuse induce ΔFosB, including cocaine, opiates, and nicotine, among others [30,35,40,41,46]. This induction is seen predominantly in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum, although lower levels of induction are seen in several other brain areas, such as prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Young animals induce higher levels of ΔFosB in response to drugs of abuse than older animals [23]. Interestingly, repetition of naturally rewarding behavior, for example, excessive wheel running or sucrose drinking, also induces ΔFosB with even greater selectivity in the nucleus accumbens ([53]; unpublished observation).

Protein isoforms of ΔFosB range in size from 33 to 37 kDa. Our current hypothesis [16,38] is that the 33-kDa isoform is the native form of the protein, because it is induced

$^{a}$ In most cases, a comprehensive mapping of ΔFosB induction in brain has not been carried out. In addition, the Table does not list all brain regions where ΔFosB induction has been reported, but lists examples of the regions that show the most prominent induction. Brain regions are listed in rough order of degree of ΔFosB induction.

Several forms of chronic stress, including restraint stress, unpredictable stress, and foot shock stress, induce ΔFosB [8,45]. This induction varies with the type of stress involved, but with restraint and unpredictable stress is strongest in prefrontal cortex. Other brain areas that show stress induction of ΔFosB include the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, septal nuclei, locus coeruleus, and dorsal raphe. Chronic administration of first generation antipsychotic drugs, like haloperidol, causes ΔFosB induction, an effect seen most prominently in the dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens, and, to a lesser extent, in frontal cortical regions [6,24]. Second generation antipsychotic drugs, like clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, lack this effect in nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum but still cause the induction in frontal cortex. Prolonged (several days) withdrawal from morphine induces ΔFosB in some regions, like locus coeruleus and ventral tegmental area, where chronic morphine treatment itself—in the absence of withdrawal—fails to induce the protein [40]. This induction could be secondary to the severe stress of opiate withdrawal, a possibility which has not yet been explored. Chronic electroconvulsive seizures dramatically induce ΔFosB in broad regions of cerebral cortex and hippocampus [26,29].

depressants also induce ΔFosB after chronic administration [30]. This effect predominates in cortex and hippocampus as well, although a detailed mapping has not yet been carried out. Robust ΔFosB induction is seen in hippocampus after kainate-induced lesions [10,33]. Finally, dopaminergic denervation of the dorsal striatum, followed by repeated administration of L-DOPA or another dopamine agonist, causes a dramatic induction of ΔFosB in the dorsal striatum [1,6,30,44].

It is clear from the above discussion that while ΔFosB induction can occur in many brain regions, the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum are among the most commonly affected, with drugs of abuse, natural rewards, stress, antipsychotic drugs, and dopamine denervation each inducing ΔFosB in these regions. This is interesting, because these structures contain by far the highest levels of the protein under basal conditions [41]. Although a great deal more work is needed to make definitive conclusions, there is growing evidence that these different treatments induce ΔFosB in different subsets of nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatal neurons. Thus, 90–95% of the neurons in these structures are medium spiny GABAergic projection neurons, which can be divided into two main subclasses: so-called direct pathway neurons project to the midbrain and express the neuropeptides dynorphin and substance P, whereas indirect pathway neurons project to the pallidum and express enkephalin. In addition, nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum express smaller numbers of large cholinergic interneurons and several types of small GABAergic interneurons. Chronic cocaine appears to induce ΔFosB selectively in the dynorphin+/substance P+ subset of medium spiny neurons [35,41]. The same is true for excessive wheel running [53]. In contrast, chronic stress induces ΔFosB in both the dynorphin+/substance P+ and the enkephalin+ subsets of medium spiny neurons [45], whereas chronic antipsychotic drugs induce ΔFosB preferentially in the enkephalin+ subset of neurons [24]. After dopamine denervation, ΔFosB is induced in dynorphin+/substance P+ cells, but it is not known whether it is also induced in enkephalin+ cells [1]. In contrast to ΔFosB induction in medium spiny neurons, very little induction is seen under these various conditions in interneurons, and no induction has been seen in nonneural cells. These findings indicate that while many types of chronic stimuli induce ΔFosB in the same region, the functional consequences may be very different because different cell types are involved.

As mentioned above, ΔFosB is expressed at appreciable levels in nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum under basal conditions. Another region where basal expression is seen is the suprachiasmatic nucleus, a region of hypothalamus which houses the brain’s central circadian clock [48]. During the night, photic stimulation induces transient levels of c-Fos, Fra-2, and full-length FosB protein. It is theorized that ΔFosB/JunD complexes may constitutively bind AP-1 sites in this region, and that c-Fos, Fra-2, and FosB (along with JunB) compete for binding after induction by light.

regulation of AP-1-mediated gene expression by light in the SCN may contribute to the molecular clock that governs circadian rhythms.

3. Behavioral plasticity mediated by ΔFosB: role in drug addiction

The first direct evidence for the influence of ΔFosB on complex behavior was obtained from the study of FosB knockout mice [25]. We observed that FosB mutants display a heightened sensitivity to the initial locomotor and rewarding effects of cocaine. However, the mice fail to show behavioral sensitization that normally occurs with repeated drug administration. As well, the FosB mutants show abnormal biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral responses to electroconvulsive seizures ([26]; see below). Because these mice lack both full-length FosB and ΔFosB, it is impossible to determine from these studies the specific role of ΔFosB in these various phenotypes. Furthermore, as with any traditional knockout, the lack of FosB and ΔFosB protein throughout development could lead to many compensations, which further complicate interpretation of the adult knockouts. Indeed, these FosB knockout mice may be

Fig. 2. Illustration of the tetracycline gene regulation system. One transgene expresses tTA under the control of a promoter of choice. The other transgene expresses the protein of interest under the control of the TetOp promoter, which is activated by tTA. Doxycycline (doxy; a tetracycline derivative) binds to tTA and prevents this action. In the example shown [31,17], a fragment of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter is used to drive tTA, and the TetOp-driven gene is ΔFosB. In bitransgenic mice, removal of doxy causes the induction of ΔFosB selectively in cells in which the NSE promoter is active.

markedly abnormal; for example, female mutants do not foster their pups [11].

In an attempt to overcome these limitations with the traditional knockout, we used the tetracycline gene regulation system to overexpress ΔFosB in a regionally and temporally specific manner in the adult brain (Fig. 2) ([17,32]). This bitransgenic system involves one gene that encodes the tetracycline transactivator (tTA, which is inhibited by tetracycline) and a second that encodes ΔFosB downstream of the TetOp promoter. The TetOp promoter is bound by tTA to activate transcription of ΔFosB, but this occurs only in the absence of tetracycline. To obtain regional expression of these transgenes, tTA was placed downstream of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter. Serendipitously, two of the NSE-tTA lines generated take advantage of nearby enhancer elements that direct expression almost exclusively to the striatum (nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum), with some expression seen in hippocampus and frontal cortex. One line (Line A) expresses ΔFosB only in the dynorphin+/substance P+ cells in the striatum, mirroring the expression seen after chronic cocaine administration or excessive wheel running [32]. The other line (Line B) expresses in both subsets of medium spiny neurons, with expression predominating in the enkephalin+ cells [53]. To induce ΔFosB specifically in adulthood, NSE-tTA × TetOp-ΔFosB animals are bred and raised on doxycycline (a tetracycline derivative) in their drinking water until 6–8 weeks of age. ΔFosB expression gradually increases after doxycycline removal, with maximum expression occurring after another 6–8 weeks. We have also generated NSE-tTA × TetOp-ΔcJun mice, which inducibly overexpress a truncated dominant negative mutant of c-Jun [43]. This mutant antagonizes the transcriptional activating effects of ΔFosB and of all other active AP-1 complexes. ΔcJun exerts this pan-AP-1-dominant negative effect because it can readily heterodimerize with all Fos and Jun family proteins. Thus, although the predominant binding partner for ΔFosB in vivo appears to be JunD, ΔFosB can bind all Jun family members.

We have now extensively characterized the Line A ΔFosB-expressing mice in models of drug addiction. The ΔFosB phenotype is summarized in Table 2. With maximal ΔFosB expression, these mice show an increased locomotor response to cocaine after both initial and repeated cocaine treatments [32]. They also show an increase in the rewarding effects of drugs, including increased preference for cocaine and for morphine in place-conditioning assays [32,56], increased self-administration of low doses of cocaine [20], and increased motivation or incentive drive for cocaine using a progressive ratio paradigm [20]. In addition, the ΔFosB mice show reduced analgesic responses to morphine, as well as exaggerated development of physical morphine dependence [56]. Most of these behavioral effects of ΔFosB are not seen in the Line B ΔFosB-expressing mice, indicating a specific role of ΔFosB in the dynorphin+/substance P+ neurons in producing these actions [56].

Subjecting wild-type mice to repeated, inescapable foot shocks, as mentioned earlier, induces ΔFosB in several brain regions, most notably, the nucleus accumbens and dorsal raphe [8]. Interestingly, individual animals show a wide spectrum of ΔFosB induction in these regions after periods of chronic stress. These low to high levels of ΔFosB induction negatively correlate with the degree to which the animals also develop learned helplessness. Learned helplessness describes the situation where some animals subjected to inescapable foot shock fail to display escape behavior when the animals are subsequently allowed to escape. These correlative data therefore suggest that induction of ΔFosB represents an adaptive, active coping mechanism that opposes the development of learned helplessness. Consistent with this hypothesis are preliminary data that overexpression of ΔFosB in the dorsal raphe, by use of viral-mediated gene transfer, reduces learned helplessness behavior [8]. Analogous studies in the nucleus accumbens are now underway. While preliminary, these findings are consistent with the proreward, promotivational effects of ΔFosB seen in drug abuse models, and are important because they suggest the type of role that ΔFosB may serve under normal conditions.

Moreover, ΔcJun-expressing mice generally show the opposite behavioral phenotypes compared to the Line A ΔFosB mice [43,56].

Taken together, these findings provide increasing evidence that induction of ΔFosB dynorphin+/substance P+ striatal medium spiny neurons is both necessary and sufficient to produce increased sensitivity to the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse, which would be expected to make an individual more vulnerable to addiction [38]. In addition, ΔFosB appears to increase the incentive motivational effects of drugs, which may lead to a propensity for relapse even after prolonged withdrawal periods. Preliminary experiments suggest that the ΔFosB-expressing mice exhibit increased anxiolytic responses to alcohol, which is associated with increased alcohol use in humans (see Ref. [38]). Interestingly, these animals also show an increase in compulsive wheel running [53] and in incentive motivation for sucrose [42], which indicates that ΔFosB may sensitize animals to other compulsive, rewarding behaviors as well.

## 4. Behavioral plasticity mediated by ΔFosB: role in stress responses

Recent studies have begun to assess the role of ΔFosB in stress responses. While stress induces ΔFosB in several brain regions [45], its induction in nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum can be best understood within a functional context. Thus, in light of the ability of ΔFosB in striatum to promote aspects of drug addiction, induction of the protein in this region by chronic stress may serve as one mechanism by which stress increases risk for addiction, as seen in many animal models as well as in humans.

## 5. Behavioral plasticity mediated by ΔFosB: role in dyskinesia

Among the stimuli that robustly induce ΔFosB in striatal regions are first-generation antipsychotic drugs, as well as dopamine denervation coupled with repeated dopamine agonist treatment. Induction by chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs is mediated via the D2 antagonist properties of these agents [6,24,41]. Induction after dopamine denervation is presumably due to the supersensitivity of dopamine receptors that occurs under these conditions [22]. The functional consequences of ΔFosB induction seen with antipsychotic drugs and dopamine denervation are not known, but several lines of evidence suggest a possible role in mediating the dyskinesia that develops in both of these contexts. Tardive dyskinesia is one of the most disabling side effects of first generation antipsychotic drugs, and dyskinesia is often a limiting side effect in the use of L-DOPA in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. First, the ability of a range of antipsychotic drugs to induce tardive dyskinesia in humans roughly correlates with their ability to induce ΔFosB in dorsal striatum after chronic administration [6]. Second, ΔFosB is induced in the dorsal striatum of humans with Parkinson’s disease examined at autopsy [50], and this induction correlates with the severity of certain dyskinetic symptoms present before death [14]. Third, the severity of dyskinesia in rodent and primate models of Parkinson’s disease correlates with the degree of ΔFosB induction in striatum, and infusion of antisense oligonucleotides to ΔFosB (which would cross-react with FosB as well) reduces these dyskinetic symptoms [1,44,55]. The possibility that

ΔFosB mediates dyskinetic symptoms raises the novel possibility that disruption of ΔFosB induction or function has the potential of treating these symptoms, a possibility that now deserves direct investigation in humans.

## 6. Genomic effects of ΔFosB: overall patterns of gene expression

Because ΔFosB is a transcription factor, it is likely that it produces these complex behavioral phenotypes to drugs of abuse and other stimuli by enhancing or repressing gene expression. As mentioned previously, ΔFosB is a truncated form of FosB that lacks most of the C-terminal trans-activation domain of FosB but retains the dimerization and DNA-binding domains. ΔFosB is able to bind to all Jun family members in vitro and binds AP-1 sites in DNA. Although ΔFosB dimerizes predominantly with JunD in vivo, this may simply reflect the fact that JunD is the most prevalent Jun family member expressed in brain under chronic treatment conditions. Some in vitro studies suggest that because ΔFosB lacks much of its transactivation domain, it functions as a negative regulator of AP-1 activity, while others show that ΔFosB can activate transcription at AP-1 sites [16,21,37,55].

In a recent study, we provided in vivo evidence that depending on the level of ΔFosB protein or the length of time that it is expressed, it can do both [34]. This study takes advantage of the NSE-tTA × TetOp-ΔFosB and NSE-tTA × TetOp-ΔcJun bitransgenic mouse lines described above; in these mice, ΔFosB or ΔcJun levels gradually increase with time off of doxycycline. Gene expression patterns from the nucleus accumbens of these mice were assessed at various time points after doxycycline removal using Affymetrix microarrays. Interestingly, the patterns of gene expression did not simply go up or down with increasing ΔFosB levels. Rather, the pattern of gene expression reversed, such that genes that were up-regulated with short-term expression of ΔFosB were generally down-regulated after long-term expression and vice versa. Importantly, short-term ΔFosB expression leads to an expression pattern that is very similar to that seen with ΔcJun, while long-term expression of ΔFosB leads to an expression pattern that is generally opposite to ΔcJun. Furthermore, short-term and long-term ΔFosB expression leads to opposite effects on behavior; short-term ΔFosB expression, much like the expression of ΔcJun, reduces the preference for cocaine, while longer term ΔFosB expression increases cocaine preference. These results suggest that short-term or a low expression level of ΔFosB leads to inhibition of AP-1 transcription, whereas longer term or higher levels of expression leads to activation of transcription at AP-1 sites [34]. The mechanism responsible for this shift is currently under investigation.

Short-term ΔFosB expression causes changes in gene expression that are strikingly similar to those seen with expression of another transcription factor, CREB, that also

Mice carrying the NSE-tTA transgene alone were given daily i.p. injections of cocaine (10 mg/kg) or saline for 5 days (A), or cocaine (15 mg/kg) or saline for 5 days/week × 4 consecutive weeks (B), and were sacrificed 24 h after the last injection. RNA was isolated from the nucleus accumbens and subjected to microarray analysis.

regulates many of the behavioral responses to drugs of abuse [7,13]. Short-term ΔFosB and CREB overexpression both reduce preference for cocaine and up-regulate many of the same genes, including several with CRE (CREB response element) sites and known CREB target genes [34]. These results suggest that short-term ΔFosB expression may lead to an increase in CREB activity or the regulation of genes with CRE sites by ΔFosB. Furthermore, we found that short-term ΔFosB and CREB expression regulate several of the same genes as a short (5 days) cocaine treatment, while a longer (4 weeks) cocaine treatment induces more of the genes that are regulated by long-term ΔFosB [34]. These results suggest that ΔFosB plays a dominant role in mediating the changes in gene expression that occur as a result of chronic cocaine treatment (Fig. 3).

## 7. Genomic effects of ΔFosB: identification of candidate target genes

Several target genes of ΔFosB have been established using a candidate gene approach (Table 3). One candidate gene is GluR2, an AMPA glutamate receptor subunit [32]. ΔFosB overexpression in inducible bitransgenic mice selectively increases GluR2 expression in the nucleus accumbens, with no effect seen on several other AMPA glutamate receptor subunits analyzed. Conversely, expression of ΔcJun, a dominant negative inhibitor of AP-1 transcription, blocks the ability of cocaine to up-regulate GluR2 [43]. AP-1 complexes comprised of ΔFosB (and most likely JunD) bind a consensus AP-1 site present in the GluR2 promoter. Furthermore, GluR2 overexpression via viral-mediated gene transfer

$^a$ Although ΔFosB regulates the expression of numerous genes in brain (e.g., Ref. [34]), the table lists only those genes that meet at least three of the following criteria: (1) increased (↑) or decreased (↓) expression upon ΔFosB overexpression; (2) reciprocal or equivalent regulation by ΔJun, a dominant negative inhibitor of AP-1-mediated transcription; (3) ΔFosB-containing AP-1 complexes bind to AP-1 sites in the promoter region of the gene; (4) ΔFosB causes a similar effect on gene promoter activity in vitro as seen in vivo.

$^b$ Despite this evidence that ΔFosB acts to repress the dynorphin gene, there is other evidence that it may act to activate the gene (see [Refs,1,14]).

mice represses dynorphin expression in striatal regions [49]. On the other hand, the prolonged up-regulation of dynorphin expression seen in striatum upon dopamine denervation and L-DOPA treatment closely parallels the robust induction of ΔFosB that occurs under these conditions [3]. Further studies are needed to clarify these discrepant findings and establish how ΔFosB regulates the dynorphin gene under normal and pathological conditions.

## 8. Genomic effects of ΔFosB: open-ended search for novel target genes

The second approach that has been used to identify target genes of ΔFosB has measured the gene expression changes that occur upon ΔFosB (or ΔcJun) expression using DNA microarrays, as described earlier. Studies using the bitransgenic mice that overexpress ΔFosB specifically in the striatum after doxycycline removal have led to the identification of many genes that are up- or down-regulated by ΔFosB expression [4,18,19,34,]. Two genes which appear to be induced through ΔFosB’s actions as a transcriptional activator are cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (Cdk5) and its cofactor P35 [4,17,49,55]. Cdk5 is also induced by chronic cocaine in the nucleus accumbens, an effect blocked upon ΔcJun expression, and ΔFosB binds to and activates the Cdk5 gene through an AP-1 site in its promoter. Cdk5 is an important target of ΔFosB, because its expression has been directly linked to changes in the phosphorylation state of numerous synaptic proteins [9], as well as increases in dendritic spine density [39], in the nucleus accumbens that are associated with chronic cocaine administration [47].

Another ΔFosB target identified by use of microarrays is nuclear factor-kappaB (NFκB). This gene is induced in the nucleus accumbens by ΔFosB overexpression and by chronic cocaine, an effect blocked by ΔcJun expression [4,43]. The contribution of NFκB to cocaine action is unknown, but the protein has been implicated in some of the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine in striatal regions [5].

Other genes that share regulation by long-term ΔFosB overexpression and by chronic cocaine administration include Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2α, adenosine 2A receptor, heat shock-protein 40, and kruppel-like factor 5 [34]. Whether these genes are direct or indirect targets of ΔFosB is yet to be determined. Many additional genes that are up-regulated by prolonged ΔFosB overexpression are down-regulated by ΔcJun. These genes include HLA-B-associated transcript 3, NMDA receptor zeta1, ADP-ribosylation factor 3, synaptotagmin VI, and prosaposin [34].

Several genes are down-regulated upon ΔFosB expression. One that has been identified recently as a downregulated target through overexpression studies in the hippocampus is CCAAT-enhancing binding protein-beta (C/EBPβ) [19]. C/EBPβ is also down-regulated by chronic, but not acute, electroconvulsive seizure treatment, suggesting
that this gene may be involved in some of the long-lasting aspects of chronic seizures, downstream of ΔFosB.

As mentioned previously, many genes that are down-regulated by prolonged ΔFosB expression in the nucleus accumbens are initially up-regulated by low levels of ΔFosB. The vast majority of these genes are also up-regulated by CREB [34]. DNA-binding assays show that after a short cocaine treatment, CREB is the primary transcription factor that binds to both CRE and AP-1 sites in the striatum [2]. However, with higher levels of ΔFosB expression, like those induced by dopamine denervation plus L-DOPA treatment, ΔFosB may become the dominant protein bound to both CRE and AP-1 sites. A similar phenomenon may occur with chronic cocaine and other treatments, but this has not been investigated directly. One possibility is that high levels of ΔFosB compete with CREB binding at CRE sites and inhibit transcription at those sites. This would account for the decrease in expression of these CREB target genes with high levels of ΔFosB expression. Undoubtedly, there are complex regulatory interactions between CRE- and AP-1-mediated transcription that are very important in controlling neuronal and behavioral plasticity.

## 9. Future directions

Increasing evidence supports the view that ΔFosB is a unique transcription factor based on its induction in brain by a range of chronic perturbations and on its high level of stability. There is also growing evidence for an important role of ΔFosB in animal models of drug addiction, Parkinson’s disease, and depression and antidepressant action. Using both candidate gene and open-ended DNA microarray approaches, numerous putative targets for ΔFosB have been identified in brain, and in some cases these target genes have been related to ΔFosB’s cellular and behavioral effects. Future research is needed to better understand the biochemical mechanisms responsible for ΔFosB’s unique stability. In addition, more work is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which ΔFosB acts as a transcriptional activator under some conditions and as a transcriptional repressor under others. This work will further establish the basis by which ΔFosB functions as a molecular switch in mediating long-term adaptations in the nervous system. It will also open new avenues for pharmacotherapeutics by determining whether agents directed against ΔFosB itself, or against any of its many target genes, would be useful in the treatment of diverse types of neuropsychiatric disorders.
