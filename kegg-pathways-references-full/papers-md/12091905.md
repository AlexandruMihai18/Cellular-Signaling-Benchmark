Staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen that secretes proteins that contribute to bacterial colonization. Here we describe the extracellular adherence protein (Eap) as a novel anti-inflammatory factor that inhibits host leukocyte recruitment. Due to its direct interactions with the host adhesive proteins intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), fibrinogen or vitronectin, Eap disrupted β₂-integrin and urokinase receptor-mediated leukocyte adhesion in vitro. Whereas Eap-expressing S. aureus induced a 2–3-fold lower neutrophil recruitment in bacterial peritonitis in mice as compared with an Eap-negative strain, isolated Eap prevented β₂-integrin-dependent neutrophil recruitment in a mouse model of acute thioglycollate-induced peritonitis. Thus, the specific interactions with ICAM-1 and extracellular matrix proteins render Eap a potent anti-inflammatory factor, which may serve as a new therapeutic substance to block leukocyte extravasation in patients with hyperinflammatory pathologies.

Staphylococcus aureus is a highly virulent pathogen posing an unabated challenge both in community-acquired as well as nosocomial infections${}^{1}$. The advent of methicillin resistance, sporadically observed since the 1960s but increasing worldwide since 1990s (ref. 2), has only recently been topped by the discovery of isolates with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin${}^{3}$, which renders the pathogen potentially resistant to all available antimicrobials. S. aureus is a frequent colonizer of the human skin and mucous membranes; the organism readily gains access to the tissue through various breaks of the skin barrier. Wound infection is frequently associated with impaired healing; however, interference of S. aureus with wound-healing mechanisms is poorly understood and is thought to rely on a variety of different virulence factors. These include exotoxins and exoenzymes (enterotoxins A–H, epidermolytic toxin A and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1)) some of which act as superantigens by binding to major histocompatibility (MHC) class II protein and stimulate T-cell proliferation${}^{4-6}$. Moreover, bacterial cell wall-anchored adhesins mediate the adherence of S. aureus to host extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin (FN), fibrinogen (FBG), vitronectin (VN), collagen or elastin which thereby contribute to bacterial colonization of host tissues${}^{7-13}$.

In particular, binding of S. aureus to FBG is predominantly mediated by clumping factor and has been implicated in the development of endocarditis or the attachment of bacteria to implanted biomaterials${}^{9,14}$. Although FN-binding proteins enhance bacterial invasion of various cell types such as endothelial cells, epithelial cells or fibroblasts${}^{15,16}$, S. aureus produces and secretes other FBG-binding proteins. These include coagulase (important in the development of pulmonary infection${}^{17,18}$), the extracellular FBG-binding protein (Efb)${}^{19}$, as well as a 60-kD protein with a broad repertoire of binding interactions to host extracellular matrix components. This latter protein was designated Map (MHC class II analogous protein) or Eap (extracellular adherence protein) because of its ability to enhance bacterial adherence${}^{20-22}$. However, the possibility that these secreted bacterial proteins—especially Eap—interfere with the host-defense systems has not been thoroughly investigated.

As an immediate response towards bacterial infection or injury, leukocytes migrate from the blood stream into extravascular sites of inflammation. This coordinated sequence of adhesion and locomotion steps requires the expression and upregulation of various adhesion receptors on the surface of mobile and stationary vascular cells. Although leukocyte rolling depends on selectins, the firm adhesion to and transmigration through the endothelium is predominantly mediated by the β₂-integrins Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18, αMβ2, CR3) and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) (CD11α/CD18, αLβ₂) that interact with their major counter-receptor intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on endothelial cells. Mac-1 also regulates leukocyte adhesion to provisional matrix substrates including FBG, which is deposited at sites of inflammation and injury upon injury.

Mac-1, whereas adhesion to ICAM-1 on endothelial cells is mediated by Mac-1 and LFA-1. Adhesion to FN is mediated by the β₁-integrin VLA-4. All these adhesion reactions are upregulated by Mn²⁺ or phorbol ester (PMA). Moreover, leukocyte adhesion to immobilized VN is mediated by uPAR, whereas uPA augments this adhesion by increasing the affinity of the uPAR–VN interaction²⁹⁻³¹. In order to characterize the role of *S. aureus* Eap from three strains, they were included in adhesion of U937 cells to different substrates. VLA-4-dependent U937 cell adhesion to FN was not affected by any of the Eap forms (Fig. 1a), as Eap did not interfere with the interaction between FN and VLA-4 (data not shown). However, all three Eap forms dose-dependently inhibited the uPAR-dependent adhesion to VN both in the absence of uPA as well as under uPA stimulation (Fig. 1b). Moreover, Mac-1-mediated monocyte adhesion to FBG (Fig. 1c) and Mac-1/LFA-1-dependent monocyte adhesion to immobilized ICAM-1 (Fig. 1d) were completely blocked by all three forms of Eap, both under basal conditions or under PMA or Mn²⁺-stimulation. As expected, Eap could also abolish the Mac-1/LFA-1-mediated adhesion of monocytes to an endothelial cell monolayer (data not shown). The inhibition by Eap was comparable or even stronger than the effects of previously described inhibitors of uPAR or β₂-integrin dependent cell adhesion, such as PAI-1 or HKa (Table 1)²⁷,³². In contrast to Eap, *S. aureus* clumping factor did not affect any of the above described adhesion reactions. Finally, immobilized Eap itself did not present any cell-adhesive properties in these assays (data not shown).

**Inhibition of leukocyte adhesion by *S. aureus* Eap**

The adhesion of differentiated myelo-monocytic U937 cells to immobilized FBG is predominantly mediated by the β₂-integrin

1 and uPAR/VN) can be explained by direct blockade of either the receptor (Mac-1, LFA-1, uPAR) or the respective ligand or counter-receptor (FBG, ICAM-1, VN) by Eap. In a purified system, all three forms of Eap inhibited binding of FBG to immobilized Mac-1 by more than 50% (Fig. 2$a$). Moreover, the addition of Eap substantially reduced the binding of ICAM-1 to both immobilized Mac-1 or LFA-1 (Fig. 2$b$). Eap could also block the VN-uPAR interaction both under non-stimulatory and stimulatory conditions involving uPA (Fig. 2$c$), an effect that was comparable with the inhibitory effect of PAI-1.

In order to further define the anti-adhesive properties of Eap, we tested the direct interaction of Eap with the involved receptors and adhesive ligands. All three Eap forms bound to immobilized VN, FBG, FN and ICAM-1 (Fig. 3). Moreover, these proteins interacted with immobilized Eap (data not shown), and in all cases, binding was displaced by heparin. We also observed no binding of Eap to the immobilized adhesion receptors uPAR, Mac-1 or LFA-1, suggesting that Eap blocked or competed for the receptor binding site(s) of the adhesive ligands.

Role of Eap in the adhesion of S. aureus

Another consequence of the described direct binding interaction between ICAM-1 and Eap is the possible contribution of Eap in S. aureus adhesion to endothelial cells via ICAM-1. Although Eap binds to FBG and FN, Eap does not mediate S. aureus adhesion to these proteins, as no difference between both strains was observed when we compared the adhesion to FBG or FN of S. aureus strain Newman and Eap-deficient strain AH12 (Fig. 4$a$). However, S. aureus Newman adhered to ICAM-1 and endothelial cells, and this adhesion was markedly reduced in strain AH12 (Fig. 4$a$). Moreover, the exogenous addition of Eap dose-dependently inhibited the adhesion of strain Newman to immobilized ICAM-1 (Fig. 4$b$), whereas exogenous Eap partially restored adhesion of strain AH12 to ICAM-1. These data indicate that Eap that is secreted from S. aureus and rebinds to the bacterial surface has an important role in ICAM-1-dependent adhesion of S. aureus to endothelial cells.

Inhibition of neutrophil recruitment by Eap in peritonitis

The interactions described above indicate that Eap blocks leukocyte adhesion, a process that is pivotal for the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the infected tissue. To prove that Eap indeed regulates such processes, we tested the effect of Eap *in vivo* in an acute mouse model of inflammation. Peritonitis was induced by thioglycollate injection, and after four hours there was an expected increase in the total leukocyte count, mostly attributable to emigrated neutrophils. The percentage of neutrophils among all leukocytes after 4 hours was 50–60% as compared with 3–10% 1h after stimulation ${ }^{33,34}$. The use of blocking antibodies against LFA-1, Mac-1 or ICAM-1 30 minutes before the induction of peritonitis resulted in a 50–75% inhibition of neutrophil extravasation into the inflamed peritoneum at 4 hours after thioglycollate injection (Fig. 5$a$ and $b$); isotype-matched control antibody had no effect at all (data not shown). At one and four hours after thioglycollate injection, neutrophil recruitment to the peritoneum was significantly reduced in mice pretreated intravenously with Eap7 (50, 75 and 100 μg per mouse). The maximal inhibition (>75%) was obtained at 4 hours with 100 μg Eap (Fig. 5$a$). Similarly, Eap injected intraperitoneally also blocked neutrophil recruitment by 50–60% (Fig. 5$b$).

Binding of Eap7 (2 μg/ml) to immobilized suPAR, Mac-1, LFA-1, ICAM-1 (5 μg/ml each), FN, FBG or VN (4 μg/ml each) was studied in the absence (■) or presence of heparin (10 μg/ml) (□).

ARTICLES

To further examine the anti-inflammatory role of Eap in vivo, peritonitis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of the S. aureus strain Newman and strain AH12 into different mouse groups. As Eap is partially secreted from S. aureus and partially rebinds to the bacterial surface, two different protocols were used. First, strains Newman and AH12 were cultivated for 6 and 15 hours and were injected intraperitoneally together with their 6- or 15-hour conditioned medium (chemically defined medium, HHW). Second, both strains were washed after the 6- and the 15-hour incubation period, resuspended in PBS and then injected. In both settings, there was a marked difference in the outcome of neutrophil recruitment between Eap-positive and -deficient strains. Mice injected with strain AH12 had a 2–3-fold higher number of neutrophils emigrating into the peritoneum as compared with mice injected with strain Newman. This difference was lower but still significant when the experiment was performed with washed bacteria (that is, when the Eap-rich 6-h or 15-h conditioned medium was removed) (Fig. 5c; data for 6-h incubated bacteria not shown). For comparison, peritonitis induced by isolated chemically defined medium HHW was found to be negligible (Fig. 5c). Neutrophil emigration in response to intraperitoneal injection of both strain Newman and strain AH12 was blocked by antibody against ICAM-1, indicating that there was no difference in the mechanism of neutrophil recruitment between mice that received either strain (Fig. 5d). Thus, Eap inhibits β₂-integrin-dependent neutrophil emigration in vivo.

Role of Eap in the course of experimental infection

To compare strains Newman and AH12 with respect to the overall course of disease, we used two experimental infection models. First, a wound infection model in the mouse was used where the bacteria were given subcutaneously at a skin sision. After four days, the size of the abscess and bacterial counts recovered from each wound site were determined. Colony-forming unit (c.f.u.) values in animals infected with strains Newman (*n* = 20) and AH12 (*n* = 20) were 6.83 per ml (range 5.72–8.14) and 6.55 per ml (range 3.79–7.65), respectively (log of median values and ranges from 10–90th percentile). We estimated the abscess sizes on a 0 to +++ scale: Newman-infected animals scored 1.28+ and AH12-infected animals scored 1.18+. No significant difference between groups was observed.

In the second infection model, bacteria were given intravenously into mice. After 5 days, kidneys were homogenized and bacterial counts were determined. C.f.u. values in animals infected with strains Newman (*n* = 14) or AH12 (*n* = 13) were 6.30 per ml (range 1–7.40) and 6.78 per ml (range 2.79–7.45), respectively (log of median values and ranges from 10–90th percentile). As no difference between the two strains with respect to the outcome of infection was observed, Eap does not contribute to virulence in these two models.

Discussion

The ability to interfere with the host immune system is a well-known characteristic of *S. aureus*. Protein A is the archetypal surface-associated protein comprising five repetitive structural domains, each of which can bind to the Fc region of immunoglobulins. The ensuing interference of protein A with opsonophagocytosis has been thought to be a major contributor to virulence; however, protein A may also act as an adhesin³⁵. Some of the expressed toxins (enterotoxins A-E, epidermolytic toxin A and TSST-1) are important mediators of acute reactions, such as toxic shock, by acting as superantigens⁴⁻⁶. Moreover, various bacterial proteins with affinity for the host extracellular matrix have been proposed to facilitate bacterial invasion and colonization of host tissue. Among these, *S. aureus* Eap was shown here to block host leukocyte recruitment by interfering with several interactions of adhesion receptors and ligands. Our in vitro and in vivo findings clearly define Eap as a major anti-inflammatory factor. Eap seems to specifically inhibit the host immune response against *S. aureus* by allowing survival of the pathogen in a hostile milieu. This inhibition of leukocyte recruitment by Eap may therefore explain the impaired wound healing frequently seen in *S. aureus*-infected chronic wounds. To our knowledge, this effect of Eap defines an entirely novel mechanism of *S. aureus* for resistance against the first-line host-defense mechanism, leukocyte-mediated bacterial killing.

In a system using purified components, Eap bound to proteins of the extracellular matrix such as VN, FBG and FN, and a novel binding of Eap to ICAM-1 was described. These interactions inhibited the association of Mac-1 with ICAM-1 or FBG, the binding of LFA-1 to ICAM-1 as well as the binding of VN to uPAR. In contrast, Eap did not affect the interaction between FN and its receptor VLA-4. These observations were consistent with the results obtained in intact cells.

Secreted Eap can rebind to the bacteria and represents the portion of the protein that can be extracted by LiCl from the bacterial surface. This surface-associated Eap is essential for the binding/adhesion of *S. aureus* to ICAM-1, as an Eap-negative strain showed significantly reduced activity in this respect. Eap enhances bacterial colonization by serving as a bridging molecule between host cells and the bacterium²²,³⁶. In contrast, Eap does not seem to participate in bacterial adherence to other proteins of the host extracellular matrix, for which other staphylococcal surface adhesins are responsible¹³. Eap might be engaged in the pathogenesis of impaired wound healing in wounds chronically infected with *S. aureus* or ulcers, as the presence of increased Eap levels may lead to inhibition of leukocyte recruitment into these injured sites. The infection models used in this study demonstrated that there is no major difference between the strains with or without Eap, as defined by bacterial proliferation, which was the only parameter assessed here. Importantly, a reduced inflammatory response does not necessarily have a direct influence on virulence, as bacterial invasion, establishment and growth in the body are multifactorial.

Due to the lack of influence on the course of infection, isolated Eap could be used as a lead substance in designing new peptides or non-peptidic molecules that could serve as anti-inflammatory drugs without the possible side effect of promoting *S. aureus* infection. Non-regulated adhesiveness of leukocytes, of circulating tumor cells and/or endothelial cells results in uncontrolled cellular extravasation and causes atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, or leads to tumor metastasis. In such pathological processes, Eap-derived molecules could be devised as ICAM-1 blocking agents to achieve an antiadhesive, anti-inflammatory potential during therapeutic interventions.

quently extended by our findings that Eap blocked the respective functional leukocyte adhesion systems. Finally, *in vivo* experiments demonstrated a potent inhibitory capacity of isolated Eap on $\beta_2$-integrin-dependent neutrophil recruitment into the inflamed peritoneum in mice. The concentrations of Eap used in our assays are similar to those found in the supernatant of *S. aureus* strains²². The anti-inflammatory role of Eap was further corroborated by the marked difference in neutrophil recruitment during peritonitis induced by Eap-positive compared with Eap-deficient *S. aureus* strains; neutrophil emigration into the inflamed peritoneum was 2–3-fold higher in mice that received strain AH12. This difference was reduced but still significant when peritonitis was studied with bacteria that had been separated from any additional Eap present in the conditioned medium. Thus, the anti-inflammatory activity can be attributed not only to Eap in the conditioned medium, but also to Eap that may be produced and released *in vivo*. Thus, Eap potently blocks ICAM-1-dependent leukocyte-endothelium interactions and the subsequent acute inflammatory response against *S. aureus*.

fied from human plasma and converted to the multimeric form³⁸. S. aureus clumping factor and polyclonal antibodies directed against recombinant EapN were described³⁹,⁴⁰.

**Bacterial strains and purification of Eap.** We have characterized the polymorphism of *S. aureus* strains and clinical isolates⁴⁰ of which the following *S. aureus* strains were used in this study: strain Newman D2C (ATCC 25904), strain Wood 46 (ATCC 10832), *S. aureus* clinical isolate 7 from a patient with *S. aureus* soft tissue infection and the Eap-deficient *S. aureus* mutant AH12 (ref 36). EapN, EapW and Eap7, were purified by affinity chromatography on FBG-Sepharose followed by ion-exchange chromatography using a MonoS column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden)²². EapN, EapW and Eap7 were also recombinantly expressed in *E. coli* and isolated on Ni-NTA column. Bacteria were propagated in standard media (tryptic soy, brain-heart infusion, Muller-Hinton, Luria-Bertani or chemically defined medium HHW)⁴¹.

**Cell culture and adhesion assay.** Myelo-monocytic U937 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultivated as described²⁹. Adhesion of U937 cells to immobilized VN, FN, ICAM-1, FBG or Eap (5 μg/ml each) (and to BSA as control), as well as adhesion of U937 cells to cultured HUVECs was tested as described²⁹⁻³².

**In vitro ligand-receptor interactions.** Binding of FBG to immobilized Mac-1, of ICAM-1 to each immobilized Mac-1 or LFA-1 and of VN to immobilized uPAR was performed²⁹,³². Alternatively, Eap (2 μg/ml) binding to immobilized uPAR, Mac-1, LFA-1, ICAM-1, VN, FBG, FN or BSA (each 5 μg/ml) or the binding of VN, FBG, FN or ICAM-1 (2 μg/ml each) to immobilized Eap (5 μg/ml) was performed in TBS containing 0.3% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20. Following incubation for 2h at 22 °C in each case, the respective anti-ligand antibody was added, followed by addition of appropriate secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody (DAKO) and the substrate ABTS and binding was quantified at 405 nm. Nonspecific binding to BSA-coated wells was used as blank and was subtracted to calculate specific binding.

**Adherence of *S. aureus*.** Polystyrene microtiter plates were coated with FBG, FN or ICAM-1 (5 μg/ml each), dissolved in bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6 and blocked with 3% BSA. *S. aureus* strain Newman or Eap-deficient strain AH12, each labeled with 1 μM 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF AM) (Molecular Probes, Göttingen, Germany), were added at a density of 1 × 10⁶ cells per well and incubated for 1h at 37 °C. Following a washing step, bacterial adhesion was quantified (as percentage of total cells added) in a fluorescence microplate reader (Bio-Tek, Neufahrn, Germany).

**In vivo peritonitis model.** Thioglycollate-induced peritonitis in NMRI mice (Charles River Wiga, Sulzfeld, Germany) was performed as described³²⁻³⁴. For inhibition studies, 30 min before the injection of thioglycollate, the following compounds were administered intravenously: 1) 100 μg mAb against mouse Mac-1 or mouse LFA-1; 2) 100 μg mAb against mouse ICAM-1 in PBS; or 3) 50–100 μg of Eap in PBS. In a parallel group, mice received 100 μg Eap intraperitoneally. Control mice were treated with the same volume of PBS or isotype-matched control antibodies. At 1 and 4 h following injection of thioglycollate mice were killed, the peritoneal lavage was collected and the number of emigrated neutrophils was quantified³². For the induction of bacterial peritonitis⁴², mice received 1 × 10⁹ c.f.u. of *S. aureus* Eap-positive strain Newman or Eap-deficient strain AH12 in a final volume of 1 ml intraperitoneally. First, bacterial strains were preincubated in chemically defined medium⁴¹ for 6 or 15 h followed by injection together with their 6- or 15-h conditioned medium. Second, another portion of the 6- or 15-h incubated bacteria (Newman or AH12) was washed twice in PBS and were injected in PBS. 5 h after the injection of bacteria, the number of emigrated neutrophils was quantified³². Animal experiments were approved by the local ethics committee.

**Experimental infection models.** For the wound-infection model, NMRI mice were anaesthetized and a 5-7 mm cut was made through the skin in the back. *S. aureus* strain Newman or AH12 (100 μl, 3 × 10⁷ c.f.u.) was applied to separate wounds, giving ~90% infection rate (as determined in pilot experiments). Wounds were sealed with sterile clips, and the animals were killed 4 d later. Abscess sizes were determined on a scale from 0 to +++, and after excision, they were homogenized and the c.f.u. were determined. Mice were also subjected to intravenous injections of 200 μl of either strain Newman or AH12 (4x10⁶ c.f.u.) and 5d later bacterial counts in the homogenized kidneys were determined.

**Statistical analysis.** Data were compared using ANOVA and the Student’s t test; P values of < 0.05 were regarded as significant.
