## Abstract

The activity of 7-deoxyloganin 7-hydroxylase, an enzyme catalyzing the conversion of 7-deoxyloganin into loganin, was detected in a microsomal preparation from the cell suspension cultures of *Lonicera japonica*. It was dependent on NADPH and molecular oxygen. The enzymatic reaction was inhibited by carbon monoxide as well as by several cytochrome P450 inhibitors, especially ketoconazole, indicating that the reaction was mediated by cytochrome P450. The enzyme showed substrate specificity for 7-deoxyloganin. The $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ values for 7-deoxyloganin and NADPH were estimated as 170 and 18 μM, respectively, from Lineweaver-Burk plots. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

## 1. Introduction

Secologanin, a secoiridoid glucoside, is a pivotal terpenoid intermediate in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids such as reserpine, ajmaline, ajmalicine, vincristine and vinblastine, which are biosynthesized via strictosidine, an alkaloidal glucoside, formed from secologanin and tryptamine (Zenk, 1977, 1980). *Lonicera japonica* (Caprifoliaceae) is known to contain loganin, an iridoid glucoside, as the main constituent as well as other derivatives of secologanin (Kawai et al., 1988). Our earlier studies demonstrated that the cell suspension cultures of *L. japonica* lacked the capability of secologanin biosynthesis but had the ability to convert 7-deoxyloganin and loganin into secologanin (Yamamoto et al., 1999). In our subsequent paper (Yamamoto et al., 2000), secologanin synthase, the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of loganin into secologanin was characterized as a cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenase. Some possible radical-initiating mechanisms for this conversion were also proposed instead of the ionic ring-fission process proposed by Battersby (1967), which remained unsolved through many years in spite of several efforts (Battersby et al., 1981; Inoue et al., 1981, 1989).

As mentioned above, loganin is a biosynthetic intermediate just preceding secologanin. It is presumed that hydroxylation at the 7-position of the iridoid, which leads to loganin or loganic acid, takes place at either 7-deoxyloganin or deoxloganin acid. Uesato et al. (1986) reported that hydroxylation proceeded at the stage of 7-deoxloganin acid on the basis of administering various labeled compounds to *Galium* species, which contain both iridoid and secoiridoid glucosides (Bock et al., 1976; Bianco et al., 1978; Uesato et al., 1984). On the other hand, the conversion of 7-deoxyloganin into loganin was observed in cell suspension cultures of *L. japonica* (Yamamoto et al., 1999), suggesting that hydroxylation takes place at 7-deoxyloganin. The same result was also obtained in monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthesis by Battersby et al. (1970). In the present paper, we describe the characterization of 7-deoxyloganin 7-hydroxylase from *L. japonica* cultured cells.

P450 dependent-mono-oxygenases, P450 dependent-peroxygenases (Bolwell et al., 1994) or 2-oxoglutarate-utilizing dioxygenases (Hashimoto and Yamada, 1986; De Carolis and De Luca, 1994). In order to investigate the properties of 7-deoxyloganin 7-hydroxylase, we first examined the cofactor requirement of the hydroxylase by using the cell-free extract prepared as described in the “Experimental”. NADPH, NADH, FAD, FMN and H₂O₂ were used as potential cofactors for mono-oxygenase and peroxygenase, and FeSO₄ + Na ascorbate + 2-oxoglutarate as cofactors for dioxygenase. The enzymatic reaction proceeded only in the assay system containing NADPH or NADH and the specific activity (1.66 pkat/mg protein) was higher with NADPH. The enzymatic product detected by HPLC was identified by comparison of its UV absorption spectrum and LC–MS to those of loganin. No conversion was observed with the cell-free extract denatured by heating (data not shown).

### 2.2. Localization and reaction parameters of 7-deoxyloganin 7-hydroxylase

The subcellular localization of 7-deoxyloganin 7-hydroxylase in *L. japonica* cells was investigated. The cell-free extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The precipitate was washed twice by homogenization in the same buffer followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Even after washing twice, the hydroxylase activity still remained in the microsomal fraction, indicating that 7-deoxyloganin 7-hydroxylase was tightly associated with the membrane fraction. At the same time, secologanin synthase activity was also measured because this enzyme, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, was known to be included in the same fraction (Yamamoto et al., 2000). Secologanin, however, was not detectable because the amounts of secologanin formed from 7-deoxyloganin through loganin by two enzymes would still be beyond the limits of detection.

The hydroxylase activity of the microsomal fraction was stable upon storage at –84°C for at least 6 months. The requirement of cofactors for 7-hydroxylase activity was studied in some detail using a microsomal preparation. Of the five cofactors used in this study, NADPH, NADH, NADP, NAD and FAD, NADPH was essential for enzymatic activity. As compared to NADPH, ca. 45% of the activity was detected with NADH and only ca. 10% with NADP or NAD (data not shown).

The optimal pH for the activity of 7-deoxyloganin 7-hydroxylase was 7.5 (in Tris–HCl buffer) with half-maximal values at 7.1 (in phosphate buffer) and 9.4 (in glycine–NaOH buffer). The pH optimum found was similar to those reported for cytochrome P450-dependent monoterpene hydroxylases such as sabinene hydroxylase (pH 7.4; Karp et al., 1987) and (−)-limonene C-3 and C-6 hydroxylase (pH 7.4; Karp et al., 1990),

camphor hydroxylase (pH 7.0; Funk and Croteau, 1993) and (+)-limonene-6-hydroxylases (pH 7.2–7.4; Bouwmeester et al., 1999).

In the time-course of the amounts of loganin formed by 7-deoxyloganin 7-hydroxylase, the reaction proceeded linearly for ca. 10 min and then with a slow upward hyperbolic shaped-curve until after 1 h (data not shown).

### 2.3. Characterization of 7-deoxyloganin 7-hydroxylase

The effect of molecular oxygen on 7-hydroxylase activity was examined (Table 1). The substitution of nitrogen for air reduced the enzymatic activity by ca. 50%. An absolute requirement for oxygen was demonstrated by the removal of oxygen from the assay system by addition of the glucose oxidase/catalase system (Kochs and Grisebach, 1987), where the activity was reduced to ca. 6% of the control. This inhibition was not observed when glucose oxidase was denatured by heating. These results suggest that the hydroxylation is catalyzed by cytochrome P450.

To confirm this assumption, the effects of carbon monoxide (Omura and Sato, 1964) and several cytochrome P450 inhibitors (Fujita et al., 1982; Rossi, 1983; Wendorff and Matern, 1986; Lamberts et al., 1987) on the enzyme activity were investigated. As shown in Table 1, the reaction was inhibited by ca. 60% by CO/O₂ gas mixture in the dark and this inhibition was partially reversible upon illumination with white light. Six well-known cytochrome P450 inhibitors were also examined. Of these, ketoconazole had the strongest inhibitory effect (93% inhibition at the concentration of 0.01 mM and complete at 0.1 mM). In addition, miconazole, metyrapone, ancymidol and cytochrome c at concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 mM inhibited 7-hydroxylation by 78.5 and 26.2, 92.4 and 73.6, 77.0 and 58.4, as well as 59.6 and 44.9%, respectively. The 7-hydroxylation activity was not inhibited by potassium cyanide, a potent inhibitor of peroxidases (Fujita et al., 1982). These results demonstrated that 7-deoxyloganin

7-hydroxylase was a microsomal cytochrome P-450 mono-oxygenase.

2.4. Kinetic parameters of 7-deoxyloganin 7-hydroxylase

Kinetic parameters of 7-deoxyloganin 7-hydroxylase for 7-deoxyloganin and NADPH were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots. The \( K_m \) values for 7-deoxyloganin and NADPH were 170 μM and 18 μM, respectively. The \( K_m \) value for 7-deoxyloganin was tenfold higher than those reported for other terpenoid hydroxylases such as geraniol-10-hydroxylase (15 μM) (Hallahan et al., 1992) and (-)-limonene C-3, C-6 and C-7 hydroxylases (18, 20 and 21 μM) (Karp et al., 1990), indicative of the low affinity of 7-deoxyloganin for 7-deoxyloganin 7-hydroxylase.

2.5. Substrate specificity of 7-deoxyloganin 7-hydroxylase

The substrate specificity of the 7-hydroxylase was studied. The following substrates were used: the 11-carbomethoxy-type substrates, 7-deoxyloganin, 8-epi-7-deoxyloganin, 10-deoxygeniposide, mussaenoside and adoxoside; the 11-carboxyl-type substrates, 7-deoxyloganic acid, 8-epi-7-deoxyloganic acid, 10-deoxygeniposidic acid, mussaenosidic acid and adoxosidic acid; the 11-aldehyde-type substrates, 5-deoxystansioside and boschnaloside; the 11-alcohol-type substrates, 7,8-dihydro-11-hydroxy-iridodial glucoside, 11-hydroxyiridodial glucoside; the 11-methyl-type substrates, iridodial glucoside (Fig. 1 for their structures). Of these 7-deoxy compounds, only two compounds, 7-deoxyloganin and 7-deoxyloganic acid, were hydroxylated and the production of loganic acid from 7-deoxyloganic acid was only ca. 50% of that of loganin from 7-deoxyloganin. The conversion of 7-deoxyloganin into loganin, previously observed from administration experiments to *L. japonica* cultured cells (Yamamoto et al., 1999), was also confirmed in the present study at the enzyme level. 7-Deoxyloganic acid is presumed to be an intermediate just before 7-deoxyloganin. However, our above results, coupled with those of administration experiments to *Galium mollugo* (Uesato et al., 1986), suggest that *L. japonica* cells might include the following two biosynthetic pathways; one is the pathway in which methylation of deoxyloganic acid precedes hydroxylation of the resulting ester leading to loganin (not via loganic acid). The other is the pathway via loganic acid formed by 7-hydroxylation of 7-deoxyloganic acid leading to loganin. Madyastha et al. (1973) reported that the methyltransferase from *Catharanthus roseus* plant catalyzed the conversion of loganic acid into loganin but not that of deoxyloganic acid into deoxyloganin. Thus, the biosynthetic pathway to loganin remains unclear. Further information on loganin biosynthesis in *L. japonica*

cultured cells requires detailed studies involving the administration of several substrates into the cultured cells, the purification and substrate specificity of the methyltransferase as well as the separation of cytochrome P450 dependent mono-oxygenases; this work is now in progress.

3. Experimental

3.1. Plant material and culture method

The origin and subculturing of cell suspension cultures of *Lonicera japonica* were described in our previous paper (Yamamoto et al., 1999). Fresh cells (1.5 g) were transferred to 20 ml of Murashige-Skoog liquid medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) containing 10 μM naphthaleneacetic acid and 10 μM 6-benzylaminopurine, and were agitated on a rotary shaker at a speed of 100 rpm at 23°C in the dark and subcultured every 2 weeks.

3.2. Enzyme preparation

All enzyme preparation operations were carried out at 4°C. Nine-day-old cultured *L. japonica* cells (20 g) were homogenized in 20 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 10 mM DTT and 2 g PVPP with a teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was applied to a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) previously equilibrated with 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mM DTT and then the enzyme preparation was eluted with 3.5 ml of the same buffer. The eluted solution was used as the cell-free extract.

For the microsomal preparation, the above 12,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was washed twice with 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mM DTT and then resuspended in 4 ml of the same buffer containing 10 mM DTT. This suspension was used as the microsomal fraction and was either used directly for assays, or frozen in liquid nitrogen after an addition of 10% (v/v) glycerol to the suspension and stored at −84°C.

Protein contents were determined according to the method of Bradford (1976), using bovine serum albumin as standard (Sigma, USA).

3.3. Enzyme assay for cofactor requirement

The incubation mixture contained 250 nmol 7-deoxyloganin, 200 μl cell-free extract (1.42 pkat/mg protein), various cofactors and was adjusted to a total volume of 250 μl with 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mM DTT. The cofactors used in this experiment were 250 nmol NADPH, 250 nmol NADH, 250 nmol

FAD, 250 nmol FMN, 250 nmol NADPH + 2.5 nmol FAD, 250 nmol NADPH + 2.5 nmol FMN, 250 nmol NADH + 2.5 nmol FAD, 250 nmol NADH + 2.5 nmol FMN, 40 nmol FeSO₄ + 400 nmol sodium ascorbate + 100 nmol 2-oxoglutarate or 250 nmol H₂O₂. The reaction was initiated by the addition of each cofactor to the mixture and after the incubation for 30 min at 30°C, terminated by boiling the reaction mixture on a water bath for 5 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was analyzed by reversed phase HPLC. The assays were performed in duplicate.

### 3.4. Standard enzyme assay

The incubation mixture contained the same components as described above except for the use of 200 μl of the microsomal fraction as the enzyme and 250 nmol NADPH as cofactor. After incubation for 10 min at 30°C, the mixture was treated and analyzed as described above. The assays were performed in duplicate.

### 3.5. pH-Optimum determination

Determination of the pH-optimum was carried out as described for the standard assay, but using the following three buffers: 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 5.0–7.5), 200 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.0–9.0) and 200 mM glycine–NaOH buffer (pH 8.5–10.0).

### 3.6. Oxygen dependence

The 20 ml test tubes containing all the reaction components of the standard enzyme assay except for NADPH were sealed with septum caps, and 60 ml of N₂, CO/O₂ (9:1) mixture or air were slowly bubbled into the mixture on ice, respectively. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 250 nmol NADPH, treated and analyzed as described above. The assays were performed in duplicate. To examine the effect of the light on the inhibition by CO, the tubes were kept in the System Biotron (20,000 lx of fluorescent lights) for 10 min at 30°C. Tubes covered with aluminum foil were also kept in the same chamber as the dark condition. Additionally, to examine the photochemical effect on the enzyme activities under air or under nitrogen, the tubes containing the standard incubation mixture were kept in the same chamber.

For the oxygen consumption experiments, an enzyme assay lacking NADPH was preincubated at 30°C with 10 nmol glucose, 10 unit glucose oxidase (Nacalai Tesque,
Japan) and 20 unit catalase (Sigma, USA) (Kochs and Grisebach, 1987). After 5 min, the incubation was initiated by addition of 250 nmol NADPH and continued as described above. As a comparative experiment, heat-inactivated glucose oxidase was used.

### 3.7. Inhibition experiments

The P450 inhibitors, ketoconazole, miconazole, metyrapone, ancymidol and cytochrome c were tested. Metyrapone and cytochrome c were dissolved in H₂O and others were dissolved in DMSO. KCN was dissolved in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The concentrations of inhibitors were adjusted to 1 or 0.1 mM with each solvent. The incubation mixture contained 250 nmol 7-deoxyloganin, 250 nmol NADPH, 175 μl enzyme (24.95 pkat/mg protein) and 25 μl the solution of each inhibitor in total volume of 250 μl and continued as described above.

### 3.8. HPLC analysis

The amount of loganin was determined by reversed phase HPLC using Bio-Sil C18 HL 90-5S column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Bio-Rad, USA) in an oven at 40°C, with a CH₃CN/H₂O linear gradient solvent system, from 10% MeCN to 30% MeCN in 40 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, monitoring the absorption at 240 nm. The quantities were calculated from the peak area at 240 nm recorded by Chromatopac C-RA4 (Shimadzu, Japan). Rt. of loganin, 12.8 min, Rt. of 7-deoxyloganin, 32.8 min.

### 3.9. Identification of the reaction product

The identification of the product was carried out on the basis of UV and MS spectra obtained with Shimadzu SPDM-6A HPLC-photodiode array system (Shimadzu, Japan) as well as Shimadzu high performance liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer LCMS-QP8000. The HPLC condition for the LC-MS system were as follows: column, Shim-pack VP-ODS (5 μm, 2.0 × 150 mm); solvent, CH₃CN/H₂O; linear gradient solvent system, from 10% MeCN to 30% MeCN in 30 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, monitoring the absorption at 240 nm oven temp., 40°C, Rt. of loganin, 9.5 min. Negative FAB-MS *m/z*; 389 ([M–H]⁻).

### 3.10. Determination of kinetic parameters

The apparent Michaelis constant (*K*~m~) and maximal reaction velocity (*V*~max~) for 7-deoxyloganin was determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots at 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32 mM, using 250 nmol NADPH and those for NADPH at 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16 mM, using 250 nmol 7-deoxyloganin. *K*~m~ and *V*~max~ values for 7-deoxyloganin

were 170 μM and 12.47 pkat/mg protein and for NADPH 18 μM and 8.33 pkat/mg protein, respectively.
