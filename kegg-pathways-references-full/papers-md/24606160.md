Abstract

Aims: Insufficient oligodendroglial differentiation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs) is suggested to be responsible for remyelination failure and astroglial scar formation in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis (TME). The aim of the present study is to identify molecular key regulators of OPC differentiation in TME, and to dissect their mechanism of action *in vitro*. Methods: TME virus (TMEV) infected SJL/J-mice were evaluated by rotarod analysis, histopathology, immunohistology, and gene expression microarray analysis. The STAT3 pathway was activated using meteorin and inhibited using STAT3 inhibitor VII in the glial progenitor cell line BO-1 and in primary rat OPCs *in vitro*. Results: As expected, immunohistology demonstrated progressively decreasing myelin basic protein-positive white matter in TME. In contrast, intralesional NG2-positive OPCs as well as GFAP-positive astrocytes were increased. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed 26 Gene Ontology terms including “JAK-STAT cascade” to be significantly positively correlated with the density of NG2-positive OPCs. Immunohistology revealed an increased amount of activated, phosphorylated STAT3-expressing astrocytes, OPCs, and microglia/macrophages within the lesions. Meteorin-induced activation of STAT3-signalling in BO-1 cells and primary rat OPCs resulted in an enhanced GFAP- and reduced CNPase-expression. In contrast, an oppositional result was observed in BO-1 cells treated with STAT3 inhibitor VII. Conclusions: The STAT3 pathway is a key regulator of OPC-differentiation, suggested to shift their differentiation from an oligodendroglial towards an astrocytic fate, thereby inducing astrogliosis and insufficient remyelination in TME.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an etiologically unresolved, demyelinating central nervous system (CNS) disease, affecting more than 2.5 million patients worldwide [1]. MS is characterized by an infiltration of inflammatory cells and associated with demyelination, remyelination, astrogliosis and axonal injury [1-3]. A subset of approximately 20% of all MS patients exhibits extensive remyelination, whereas especially those patients with a progressive clinical course display only limited or absent remyelination [4-7]. Experimental studies show that the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) is a prerequisite for remyelination and functional recovery, whereas surviving oligodendrocytes are relatively quiescent and do not participate in remyelination [8,9]. Many MS lesions are known to contain OPCs. However, they frequently lack differentiation to myelinating oligodendrocytes [6,10-13].

A similar situation of a progressive demyelination with insufficient remyelination despite the presence of an at least transiently increased number of intralesional OPCs is reported in the Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis (TME) virus (TMEV)-induced model of demyelination [14]. Furthermore the nerve / glial antigen 2 (NG2)-positive OPCs within the TME lesions can co-express either 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase (CNPase) or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), suggestive of an alternative oligodendrocytic or astrocytic differentiation [14]. In contrast to TME, a fast and complete remyelination can be observed in most other models of MS, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [15], cuprizone toxicity [16], lysolecithin-induced demyelination in the caudal cerebellar peduncle [17], and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) A-59 strain infection of mice [18]. This renders TME to be the most useful model to investigate chronic progressive demyelination with remyelination failure. The principal reasons for a failure of remyelination can either be a depletion of OPCs, inability of OPCs to proliferate and/or differentiate within the lesion due to a non-permissive environment, axonal loss, or the inability of chronically demyelinated axons to be remyelinated

Multiple lineage tracing studies have employed diverse transgenic mouse lines to reveal that NG2-, oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (Olig2)-, platelet derived growth factor receptor, alpha polypeptide (Pdgfra)-, and (proteolipid protein (myelin) 1 (Plp1)-promoter expressing cells, commonly classified as OPCs, principally give rise to cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage during ontogenesis, and additionally exhibit a moderate context-dependent multipotent potential *in vivo* [21-24]. Accordingly, fate-mapping studies using both constitutive and induced labelling of NG2-expressing cells revealed that these cells give rise to new NG2 cells and oligodendrocytes throughout the brain and spinal cord during embryogenesis and postnatal life, whereas over and above, a subset of these progenitors gives rise to protoplasmic astrocytes of the gray matter in the embryonic brain only [25,26]. Experiments using induced labelling of Olig2-expressing cells show that these cells develop mainly into oligodendrocytes, and to a lesser degree into astrocytes of the gray matter and Bergmann glia in the cerebellum [27-29]. Using induced labelling of Pdgfra-expressing progenitors, the majority of newly generated cells in the white matter of the adult brain are myelinating oligodendrocytes [30]. The latter study revealed no evidence for the generation of Pdgfra-expressing progenitor-derived astrocytes [30]. The origin of the reported small percentage of possibly OPC-derived neurons *in vivo* in multiple of these fate-mapping studies [27,30] is controversial and possibly results from sporadic expression of the transgenic tamoxifen-inducible Cre-recombinase in a subset of neurons [26,28,31].

Most evidence suggests that a block of oligodendrogial differentiation causes remyelination failure in MS [13,20]. However, based on our prior observation that some OPCs seem to undergo astrocytic differentiation in TME [14,32], we asked how such abnormal lineage decisions could be mechanistically explained. Therefore the aims of the present study were: 1.) to identify molecular pathways regulating the differentiation of OPCs in TME employing gene expression microarrays; 2.) to study the most promising candidate pathway *in situ*; and 3.) to

demonstrate functional activity in a simplified *in vitro* system.

# Materials and Methods

## Laboratory animal procedures

Mice were housed in individually ventilated cage systems (Tecniplast, Hohenpeißenberg, Germany), under controlled conditions as previously described [14,33-35].

Five-week-old female SJL/JHanHsd-mice (Harlan Winkelmann, Borchen, Germany) or SJL/JCrl-mice (Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany) were inoculated into the right cerebral hemisphere with 1.6×10⁶ or 4.6×10⁷ plaque forming units per mouse of the BeAn-strain of TMEV or vehicle control (mock-infection), respectively, in two independent experiments, as previously described [14,33,34].

The clinical course was evaluated with a rotarod assay (RotaRod Treadmill, TSE Technical & Scientific Equipment, Bad Homburg, Germany), as previously described [34,36,37]. The rod speed was linearly increased from 5 revolutions per minute (rpm) towards 55 rpm over a time period of 5 min. All living mice were repeatedly assayed at 0 days post infection (dpi, pre-infection) and multiple time points post infection. A mean score per mouse was calculated from three trials per time point. The attained rpm at drop was analysed for significant differences between TMEV- and mock-infected mice employing independent pair-wise Mann-Whitney U-tests (IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 20, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Statistical significance was designated as p ≤ 0.05.

Groups of six mice were necropsied at multiple time points up to 245 dpi as previously described [14,33,37].

The spinal cord was immediately dissected and representative cervical, thoracic and lumbar segments were fixed in 10% formalin, decalcified in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution and embedded in paraffin wax. The remaining parts of the spinal cord were removed from the spinal canal, immediately snap-frozen and stored at

-80°C.

All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with local authorities (Regierungspräsidium Hannover, Germany, permission numbers: 33–42502-05/963 and 33-42502-04-07/1292).

## Histology and immunohistology

Serial transversal sections of formalin fixed, paraffin embedded cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cords were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE) or Luxol fast blue-cresyl violet (LFB-CV) and semi-quantitatively assessed as previously described [33,37]. Briefly, each section was evaluated for meningitis and leukomyelitis as follows: 0 = no change, 1 = scattered perivascular infiltrates, 2 = 2 to 3 layers of perivascular inflammatory cells, 3 = more than 3 layers of perivascular inflammatory cells, and the degree of demyelination was evaluated as follows: 0 = no change, 1 = < 25%, 2 = 25–50%, 3 = 50–100% of white matter affected. A mean score per mouse was calculated from all three locations evaluated.

Immunohistology was performed on serial sections of the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded spinal cords using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride (DAB) as chromogen as previously described [14,33,35,37-39]. The used primary antibodies were directed against GFAP (polyclonal rabbit anti-cow, diluted 1:1000, Dako Diagnostika, Hamburg, Germany), myelin basic protein (MBP, polyclonal rabbit anti-human, diluted 1:800, Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany), NG2 (polyclonal rabbit anti-rat, diluted 1:200, Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3, polyclonal rabbit anti-human, diluted 1:400, Acris, Herford, Germany), phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3, monoclonal rabbit anti-human, clone EP2147Y, diluted 1:400, Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany), and TMEV (polyclonal rabbit anti-TMEV capsid protein VP1; diluted 1:2000).

For double-labelling immunohistology, we employed a sequential protocol using a rat-on-mouse alkaline phosphatase (AP) polymer kit (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA, USA), mouse-on-mouse AP polymer kit (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA, USA), or anti-rabbit AP polymer kit (Nichirei Biosciences, Tokio, Japan) with nitrotetrazolium blue chloride / 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt as chromogen (NBT/BCIP) for the first primary antibody, followed by the ABC method (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) with DAB as chromogen for the second primary antibody. Applied first primary antibodies were directed against CD107b (monoclonal rat anti-mouse, clone M3/84 diluted 1:200, AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK), GFAP (monoclonal mouse anti-pig, clone G-A-5, diluted 1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) or NG2 (polyclonal rabbit anti-rat, diluted 1:200, Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany), and the second primary antibody was directed against p-STAT3 (monoclonal rabbit anti-human, clone EP2147Y diluted 1:400, Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany).

Negative control sections were incubated with equally diluted normal rabbit serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany, R9759), a mouse IgG1 anti-isotype antibody (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany, CBL600), or a rabbit monoclonal anti-human cytokeratin 20 antibody (clone EPR1622Y, diluted 1:400, Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) instead of the primary antibodies.

The density of GFAP-, NG2-, STAT3-, p-STAT3- and TMEV-positive cells within the spinal cords was counted as described [14,34,35,37]. The MBP-positive white matter area was measured employing the analysis 3.1 software package (SOFT Imaging system, Münster, Germany) as described [14,33-35,37].

The semi-quantitative scores and cell counts were evaluated for significant differences between TMEV- and mock-infected mice using pair-wise Mann-Whitney U-tests and between lesioned white matter and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) within the TMEV-infected animals using Wilcoxon signed rank tests (IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 20, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Statistical significance was designated as p ≤

Microarray analysis

For microarray analysis RNA was isolated from snap-frozen spinal cord specimens using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), amplified and labelled employing the MessageAmp II Biotin Enhanced Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and hybridized to GeneChip mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as previously described [37,40]. Background adjustment and quantile normalization was performed using RMAexpress [41]. MIAME compliant data sets are deposited in the ArrayExpress database (E-MEXP-1717; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress).

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Version 2.0.10 was performed employing Pearson's correlation coefficient as metric to rank the genes within the gene sets derived from the Gene Ontology (GO) biological process category of the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) Version 3.1 according to their correlation to the mean density of NG2-positive cells per spinal cord as observed by immunohistology [37,42,43]. Orthologous official human gene symbols (HUGO), required as gene identifiers by GSEA were retrieved employing MADGene [44]. Gene sets in a size range from 10 to 100 genes with a p ≤ 0.05 and a false discovery rate q ≤ 0.25 were selected and ranked according to the normalized enrichment score [43].

Bottom-up analysis of manually selected candidate genes was done using classical statistics as previously described [34,45,46]. Accordingly, 229 candidate genes comprising ligands, receptors, members, activators, inhibitors and downstream targets of the Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT pathway, were manually extracted from the canonical JAK-STAT pathway of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (Entry: map04630) and peer-reviewed published literature (Supplemental Table 1) [47]. The normalized expression values of these genes were evaluated for significant differences between TMEV- and mock-infected mice.

employing independent pair-wise Mann-Whitney U-tests (IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 20, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Statistical significance was designated as p ≤ 0.05.

## Cell culture

The glial progenitor cell line BO-1 was maintained *in vitro* as previously described [32,48]. Primary rat oligodendroglial cultures were generated as previously described [49,50]. Briefly, dissociated neonatal Wistar rat cortices (P2) were digested with papain (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, USA) and plated onto poly-L-lysine-coated (75cm²) flasks. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Lonza, Cologne, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and Glutamax (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37°C and 7.5% CO₂. After 12-14 days, OPCs were isolated from the astrocyte monolayer by mechanical dissociation, while microglia were removed by differential adhesion.

For the proliferation and differentiation studies, cells were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) at a density of 5,000 BO-1 cells/well or 20,000 primary rat OPCs /well, respectively and cultured in B104-conditioned DMEM (proliferation medium), B104-conditioned DMEM containing 5 μM all-trans retinoic acid (oligodendrocytic differentiation medium), or DMEM containing 20% fetal calf serum (astrocytic differentiation medium), respectively for four days. STAT3 was selectively activated or inhibited using 200 ng/ml recombinant mouse meteorin (R&D, Wiesbaden, Germany), or 0.01 μM STAT3 inhibitor VII (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany), respectively [51,52].

Proliferation was assessed in BO-1 cell cultures by Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake using the FLUOS *in situ* cell proliferation kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according the manufacturer’s instructions.

The percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells was assessed in BO-1 cell cultures employing FITC-coupled annexin V and ethidium homodimer III, respectively, using the apoptotic/necrotic/healthy cells detection kit

(PromoKine, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The activation status of STAT3 was assessed in pelleted BO-1 cell cultures, fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin employing the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and primary antibodies directed against p-STAT3 (monoclonal rabbit anti-human, clone EP2147Y, diluted 1:1600, Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) as described for immunohistology.

Cellular differentiation was assessed in BO-1 as well as in primary rat OPC cell cultures by immunofluorescence staining as previously described [32,48,53]. The applied primary antibodies were directed against the ganglioside antigen A2B5 (A2B5, monoclonal mouse anti-chicken, diluted 1:2, hybridoma supernatant, provided by J. Trotter, Mainz), 2', 3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase; monoclonal mouse anti-human, clone 11-5B, diluted 1:800, Chemicon Europe, Hofheim/Taunus, Germany), and GFAP (monoclonal mouse anti-pig, clone G-A-5, diluted 1:400, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany; polyclonal rabbit anti-cow, diluted 1:1000, Dako Diagnostika, Hamburg, Germany). Cy3-coupled goat anti-mouse, and Cy2-coupled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:200, Jackson Immunoresearch, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were used for visualization of the immunoreactions. Nuclei were stained using bisbenzimide Hoechst 33258.

Immunofluorescence was evaluated using an inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a U-MWBP2 (BP450nm-480nm) / HQ527/30F42-527, U-MNG2 (BP530nm-550nm) / BA590 and U-MNU2 (BP360nm-370nm) / D460/50-F32-000 filter combination for Cy2-, Cy3- and bisbenzimide-fluorescence, respectively (Olympus IX-70, Hamburg, Germany). All cell culture experiments using the BO-1 cell line were independently repeated three times and all experiments using primary rat OPCs were independently repeated four times. Assessed cell counts were evaluated for significant differences using Fisher's exact tests (GraphPad Prism 6 for Windows, Version 6.01, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Statistical significance was designated as \( p \leq 0.05 \).

Results

Molecular pathways associated with OPCs in TME

An initial animal experiment was performed with groups of six TMEV- and six mock-infected SJL/JHanHsd mice necropsied at 14, 42, 98, and 196 dpi, except a group size of five TMEV-infected mice at 98 dpi. The clinical course and pathohistological changes have been described previously [37].

MBP immunohistochemistry confirmed a progressively increasing demyelination (Figure 1A-C). The morphometrically assessed MBP-positive white matter area reached a significant reduction at 196 dpi in the TMEV- as compared to the mock-infected mice (Supplemental Figure 1A). An increased number of NG2-positive OPCs, mostly exhibiting an enlarged bi- or oligopolar phenotype, was observed within the demyelinating lesions (Figure 1D-F). The density of intralesional NG2-positive cells was significantly increased between 42 and 196 dpi as compared to the NAWM of TMEV- and of mock-infected mice, with a peak already at 42 dpi and a slight decline thereafter (Supplemental Figure 1B). Furthermore, a progressively increasing number of GFAP-positive astrocytes, exhibiting a reactive phenotype, was present within the demyelinating lesions (Figure 1G-I) from 42 to 196 dpi, again compared to the NAWM of TMEV- and of mock-infected mice (Supplemental Figure 1C). TMEV antigen was detectable in the spinal cords of TMEV-infected animals only (Figure 1J-L). The number of TMEV antigen-positive cells was significantly increased from 14 to 196 dpi in TMEV- as compared to mock-infected mice (Supplemental Figure 1D).

As described in detail previously, a total of 1210 probe sets (1001 genes) were identified to be differentially expressed between TMEV- and mock-infected mice in the spinal cord over the study period at a false discovery rate of 1.0% [37]. In order to focus on transcriptional changes intimately associated with the population of NG2-positive OPCs in the present study, we performed GSEA to identify pathways co-regulated with the density of NG2-positive cells within the spinal cords as revealed by immunohistochemistry. Accordingly, GSEA revealed 26
GO terms significantly positively correlated, and no GO terms significantly negatively correlated with the mean density of NG2-positive cells within the spinal cords (Table 1). A leading edge analysis revealed a prominent cluster of 6 GO terms related to tyrosine phosphorylation and the JAK-STAT cascade which are all positively correlated with the density of OPCs (Supplemental Figure 2). Further clusters of GO terms are related to response to other organism, cytokine biosynthesis, and the nuclear factor κB pathway.

Since GSEA suggested an important association of JAK-STAT signalling with the relative abundance of OPCs in chronic demyelinating TME, a manually curated list of 229 genes involved in JAK-STAT signalling was analysed (Supplemental Table 1). Thereby, 145 of 229 genes involved in JAK-STAT signalling were found to be differentially expressed in TMEV- as compared to mock-infected mice at one or more of the studied time points.

Accordingly, an up-regulation of Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, and Stat6 was observed at various time points (Figure 2). Multiple inhibitory molecules including *the suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins* (Socs)1, Socs2, Socs3 and *protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 6* (Ptpn6, Synonym SHP-1) were also up-regulated at certain time points, whereas the *protein inhibitor of activated STAT2* (Pias2) was temporarily down-regulated. Concerning upstream ligands, *interleukin 10* (*Il10*), *Il15*, *interferon gamma* (*Ifng*), *oncostatin M* (*Osm*), *bone morphogenic protein 4* (*Bmp4*), *ciliary neurotrophic factor* (*Cntf*) and *tumor necrosis factor* (*Tnf*) were up-regulated, whereas *Meteorin* (*Metrn*) and *platelet-derived growth factor, D polypeptide* (*Pdgfd*) were down-regulated at various time points. Furthermore, constantly up-regulated downstream targets included *Gfap* and the *Proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase proviral integration site 1* (*Pim1*).

### Cellular origin and activation status of the STAT3 pathway in TME

Since STAT3 signalling is known to be an important pathway involved in the control of proliferation and differentiation of neuroglial progenitor cells and astrocytes [54–56], we focussed on STAT3 in our further studies.

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.A second independent animal experiment was performed with groups of six TMEV- and six mock-infected SJL/JCrl mice necropsied at 0, 4, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 98, 147, 196, and 245 dpi to investigate the cellular origin and activation status of STAT3 with a higher temporal resolution.

Rotarod analysis revealed a slightly increased motor performance at 14 and 28 dpi and a progressively decreasing motor performance from 42 to 245 dpi in TMEV- as compared to mock-infected mice (Supplemental Figure 3).

Semi-quantitative pathohistological examination of the spinal cords revealed a significantly elevated lymphohistioplasmacytic meningitis and leukomyelitis starting at 4 and 14 dpi, respectively in TMEV- as compared to mock-infected mice (Figure 3, Supplemental Figure 4A). The extent of these inflammatory changes increased towards a plateau phase from 147 to 245 dpi. A significantly elevated and progressively increasing demyelination was detected from 42 to 245 dpi in TMEV- as compared to mock-infected mice (Figure 3, Supplemental Figure 4B). The inflammatory as well as the demyelinating changes were mainly found in the thoracic and cervical spinal cord, whereas the lumbal segments displayed only minor changes. None of the mock-infected mice showed demyelinating lesions.

The morphometrically assessed MBP-positive white matter area showed a significant reduction in the TMEV- as compared to the mock-infected mice at 196 and 245 dpi (Figure 4A). Furthermore, a significantly increased density of intralesional GFAP-positive cells was detected from 28 to 245 dpi (Figure 4B). TMEV antigen was detectable in the spinal cords of TMEV-infected animals only, and the number of TMEV antigen-positive cells was significantly increased at 42 dpi and from 147 to 245 dpi in TMEV- as compared to the mock-infected mice (Figure 4C). The density of intralesional STAT3- as well as p-STAT3-positive cells was significantly increased between 14 and 245 dpi (Figure 4D-E). Both, the density of STAT3- and p-STAT3-positive cells displayed a significant, moderate, positive correlation to the density of GFAP-positive cells (Table 2). Furthermore, p-STAT3

exhibited a strong correlation to the density of TMEV antigen-positive cells. Most of the STAT3-positive cells exhibited a medium size, bi- or oligopolar spindloid morphology, moderate amount of cytoplasm and central euchromatic oval nuclei resembling astrocytes (Figure 5A-C). Whereas in normal appearing white matter areas of TMEV- and mock-infected mice only 21% of all STAT3-positive cells showed nuclear labelling, this value increased to 36% cells in TME lesions, suggesting overall activated STAT3 signalling (Figure 5B-C). This is supported by the exclusively nuclear staining pattern of the phosphorylation-sensitive p-STAT3 antibody (Figure 5D-E). Based on cellular morphology, 78% of the intralesional p-STAT3-positive cells are astrocytes, followed by 18% microglia/macrophages and 4% other non-classifiable cells (Figure 4F).

Double-labelling immunohistology demonstrated p-STAT3 expression by nearly all intralesional GFAP-positive astrocytes (Figure 5G), NG2-positive OPCs (Figure 5H), and CD107b-positive microglia/macrophages with Gitter cell morphology (Figure 5I).

### Effect of STAT3 activation on cultured BO-1 cells and primary rat OPCs

To determine the effect of enhanced STAT3 signalling on oligodendrocyte lineage cells, we turned to a simplified *in vitro* model. The basal proliferation rate of BO-1 cells, a progenitor cell line grown in the different media was studied using BrdU labelling (Supplemental Figure 5A-C). BrdU-uptake was detectable in 24%, 22% and 5% of the cells cultured in proliferation medium, oligodendrocytic differentiation medium and astrocytic differentiation medium, respectively (Supplemental Figure 6A). Simultaneous activation of the STAT3 pathway in the presence of meteorin did not alter the proliferation rate (Figure 6A-C). In contrast, inhibition of the STAT3 pathway using STAT3 inhibitor VII resulted in severe to complete abrogation of cell proliferation as well as in cell death when added to proliferation- and oligodendrocytic differentiation medium (Figure 6D-E). However, the proliferation rate was unaltered in the combination with astrocytic differentiation medium (Figure 6F).

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
The percentage of necrotic BO-1 cells was dependent on the medium with about 6% (ethidium homodimer III-positive) dying cells in proliferation medium, 20% in oligodendrocytic differentiation medium, and 2% in astrocytic differentiation medium, respectively (Supplemental Figure 6B). In contrast, the percentage of (FITC-annexin V-positive) apoptotic cells was unaffected by the three different media (Supplemental Figure 6C).

Activation of the STAT3 pathway employing meteorin did not alter the percentage of necrotic cells (Figure 7A-C), or apoptotic cells (Figure 7D-F). In contrast, inhibition of the STAT3 pathway by STAT3 inhibitor VII increased cell death as 95% and 98% of all cells where necrotic in both proliferation- and oligodendrocytic differentiation medium (Figure 7G-H), and 12% necrotic cells in astrocytic differentiation medium (Figure 7I).

The status of activation of the STAT3 pathway was assessed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded BO-1 cell pellets. The percentage of p-STAT3 positive nuclei was dependent on the applied medium with 9% p-STAT3-positive nuclei in proliferation medium, 5% in oligodendrocytic differentiation medium, and 21% in astrocytic differentiation medium, respectively (Supplementary Figure 6D). Activation of the STAT3 pathway by meteorin resulted in a significant ~2-fold increase of the percentage of p-STAT3-positive nuclei in all three media (Figure 8A-C). In contrast, inhibition of the STAT3 pathway using STAT3 inhibitor VII resulted in a significant ≤0.6-fold decrease of the percentage of p-STAT3-positive nuclei in all three media (Figure 8D-F).

The capacity of the initially mostly A2B5-positive, bipolar BO-1 cells (Supplemental Figure 5D-F) to differentiate to either CNPase-positive, multiprocessed cells with an immature oligodendrocyte morphology (Supplemental Figure 5G-I) or GFAP-positive, plump spindloid cells with astrocytic morphology (Supplemental Figure 5J-L) is known to be dependent on the applied medium [32,48]. Accordingly, 92% of the cells expressed A2B5 in proliferation medium and in oligodendrocytic differentiation medium, whereas only 87% of the cells expressed this marker when cultured in astrocytic differentiation medium (Supplemental Figure 6E). CNPase was expressed by 7%, 35% and 0.2% of BO-1 cells in proliferation, oligodendrocytic or astrocytic differentiation

Activation of the STAT3 pathway by meteorin resulted only in a non-significant trend towards a lower percentage of CNPase-positive cells in all three media (Figure 9A-C). In contrast, meteorin in combination with astrocytic differentiation medium significantly induced an 1.5-fold increase in the percentage of GFAP-expressing cells with astrocytic morphology (Figure 9F). However the percentage of GFAP-expressing cells was unchanged in combination with proliferation medium and oligodendrocyte differentiation medium (Figure 9D-E).

Inhibition of the STAT3 pathway using STAT3 inhibitor VII resulted in complete cellular degeneration and loss when used in combination with both proliferation- and oligodendrocytic differentiation medium (Figure 9G-H, J-K). However, STAT3 inhibitor VII in combination with astrocytic differentiation medium significantly induced a 10-fold increase in the percentage of CNPase-expressing cells with immature oligodendrocyte morphology (Figure 9I). Furthermore, there was a non-significant trend towards a lower percentage of GFAP-expressing cells (Figure 9L).

In order to substantiate the above described findings, the experiments addressing differentiation were repeated with primary rat OPCs to control for cell line-specific artifacts. A significantly higher percentage of 38% and 46% CNPase-expressing cells was observed when primary rat OPCs where cultured in proliferation and oligodendrocytic differentiation medium, respectively, compared to only 14% CNPase expressing cells using astrocytic differentiation medium (Supplemental Figure 7A). In contrast, a significantly higher percentage of 56% GFAP-expressing cells was observed when primary rat OPCs where cultured in astrocytic differentiation medium as compared to 15% and 10% GFAP-expressing cells using proliferation- and oligodendrocytic differentiation medium, respectively (Supplemental Figure 7B).

Activation of the STAT3 pathway in primary rat OPCs by meteorin resulted in a significantly, 0.8- and 0.4-fold decreased percentage of CNPase-expressing cells in combination with proliferation and astrocytic differentiation medium, respectively (Figure 10A-C). In contrast, meteorin induced a significantly, 1.6- and 1.9-fold increased percentage of GFAP-expressing cells in combination with proliferation and astrocytic differentiation medium, respectively (Figure 10D-F).

Inhibition of the STAT3 pathway using STAT3 inhibitor VII in primary rat OPCs did not affect CNPase- and GFAP-expression in any of the tested media (Figure 10D-L).

## Discussion

This study was performed to identify molecular mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of OPCs which is suggested to be the key factor responsible for remyelination failure in TME [13,14,20,32].

Our initial experiment with TMEV-infected SJL/JHanHsd-mice revealed a chronic progressive demyelination, an increased number of intralesional OPCs with a maximum density in early demyelinating lesions and a chronic progressive astrogliosis, which is in general agreement with the results of a previously published, independent experiment [14,33].

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed to combine the data of gene expression microarray studies with the morphometrically assessed density of OPCs within the spinal cords from the same animals in order to search for transcriptional changes intimately associated with the OPCs at the pathway level [37,43]. Accordingly, a cluster of 6 GO terms related to tyrosine phosphorylation and the JAK-STAT cascade represented the most interesting finding from the list of 26 GO terms significantly positively correlated to the density of OPCs.

Notably, a recent meta-analysis identified the JAK-STAT cascade to be one out of 15 GO terms significantly positively correlated with demyelination in MS, TME, EAE and a transgenic TNF-overexpressing mouse model

of demyelination [57], highlighting that JAK-STAT signalling is of general importance in demyelinating conditions. The JAK-STAT cascade is involved in a plethora of physiological and pathological conditions including the inflammatory and immune responses [58,59], and tumorigenesis [35,60]. Binding of many extracellular ligands such as cytokines, growth factors and hormones to their cell surface receptors can lead to a recruitment of JAKs followed by activation of a context dependent set out of the seven different STATs by tyrosine phosphorylation. The activated STATs homo- or heterodimerize, translocate to the nucleus, bind to specific DNA motifs and induce the expression of their target genes [61-63].

With the JAK-STAT cascade being an interesting candidate pathway, we focused our analysis on a manually curated list of genes involved in JAK-STAT signalling. The demonstration of up-regulated expression of *Stat1*, -2, -3, -4, and -6 as well as several upstream activators and downstream targets in TME did not unequivocally indicate which of the multiple STAT cascades is most important in the setting of OPC dysregulation. Furthermore, the transcriptional profiles give no information concerning the phosphorylation dependent activation status of the various JAK-STAT pathways [61]. However, the different STAT proteins are activated by various upstream events with considerable specificity and are known to be involved in different processes [64]. STAT1 and -2 are both participating in interferon signalling and the activation of the inflammatory response [59,65]. STAT4 and -6 are essential for the differentiation of T cells into the Th1- or Th2-phenotype, respectively, and thus the activation of the adaptive immune response [58,65]. Remarkably, the STAT3 pathway is known to be a key regulator that promotes astrocytic differentiation in neuroglial progenitor cells during embryogenesis [54,55,66,67], and represents a molecular hub for signalling pathways in glial tumors such as glioblastoma [35,60]. Furthermore, multiple genome-wide association studies implicate the *STAT3* gene as a MS susceptibility locus [68,69]. Based on this knowledge, STAT3 was selected for further experimental analysis.

We performed a second independent experimental series with TMEV-infected SJL/JCrl-mice and more time

points with the aim to determine the cellular localisation and activation status of STAT3 at a higher temporal resolution. As expected, we observed an exacerbating locomotor system dysfunction and lymphohistioplasmacytic leukomyelitis with progressively increasing demyelination and astrogliosis as described in previous TME studies [14, 33, 36, 70-72], and in chronic progressive MS [3, 5, 73-75].

Immunohistology revealed a robustly elevated number of STAT3- as well as p-STAT3-positive cells within the demyelinating lesions, mostly exhibiting an astrocytic morphology and co-expressing p-STAT3 and GFAP. Similarly, robust astrocyte-specific STAT3-expression is reported in normal human subjects and in MS lesions [76]. The correlation between the density of p-STAT3-positive cells and the density of TMEV- and GFAP-positive cells suggests a causal link from TMEV infection to STAT3-activation and hyperplasia of astrocytes within the lesions. This hypothesis is in agreement with the role of STAT3 signalling in the induction of astrogliosis after traumatic central nervous system injury [77-80].

We note that reactive astrogliosis is not always harmful, since it improves wound healing and functional recovery after traumatic CNS injuries, due to its restriction of secondary inflammation [77, 78, 80]. Since other studies suggest that reactive astrocytes mediate pro-inflammatory effects which increase disease severity in EAE and TME [81-83], and since reactive astrogliosis can impede axonal regeneration after CNS injury [84, 85], the answer to the question whether reactive astrocytes are beneficial or harmful is most likely context dependent. A recent microarray study comparing reactive astrocytes in ischemia and neuroinflammation suggests the existence of different anti- and pro-inflammatory subtypes of reactive astrocytes, with Stat3 being ~2-fold up-regulated in both subtypes [86].

The identification of intralesional spindloid cells co-expressing p-STAT3 and NG2 supports our GSEA results, suggesting that the JAK-STAT cascade is an important signalling pathway within intralesional OPCs. It seems reasonable that this active intranuclear p-STAT3 shifts the differentiation of the intralesional OPCs towards an

astrocytic fate, since STAT3 is known to induce astrocytic differentiation in neuroglial progenitor cells during

embryogenesis [54, 55, 66, 67]. In agreement with this, a minor amount of intralesional cells exhibiting NG2 and

GFAP colocalization has been described in a previous TME study [14], MHV-induced demyelination [18], as

well as traumatic CNS injury [87]. Furthermore, a genetic fate-mapping study employing a freeze-injury of the

brain displayed a high amount of OPCs differentiating into astrocytes [21]. Additionally, a low but distinct

percentage of OPCs is known to differentiate into astrocytes in demyelinating lesions induced by ethidium

bromide and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [23, 24]. In contrast to these demyelinating

conditions, there is progressive demyelination and astrogliosis with only delayed and insufficient remyelination

in TME [14], which is suggested to result from a different micromilieu within the lesions reducing the capability

of the OPCs to differentiate into oligodendrocytes. Obviously, not all astrocytes within the sclerotic lesions of

chronic progressive TME are derived from OPCs, since in analogy to other pathological conditions the majority

of astrocytes is generated by parenchymal astrocytes that re-enter the cell cycle [22, 23, 88].

Our observation that the majority of intralesional CD107b-positive cells with Gitter cell morphology

co-expressed p-STAT3 is in agreement with its function in microglia/macrophage activation and M1-type

polarization [89]. It has to be mentioned that STAT3 is also an essential transcription factor in the differentiation

of Th17-lymphocytes [90, 91]. However, no prominent STAT3 expression was observed in the lymphocytes

within the perivascular cuffs in the present study. Recently, treatment of EAE-affected mice with the STAT3 and

p65 NFkB inhibitor anatabine was shown to reduce the amount of microglia/macrophages and astrogliosis in the

spinal cords [92].

We performed *in vitro* experiments using the glial progenitor cell line BO-1 and primary rat OPCs in order to

obtain supportive evidence for the suggested molecular switch-like action of STAT3 on the differentiation of

OPCs in TME lesions. The spontaneously transformed BO-1 cell line exhibits an OPC-like phenotype and can be

the cell culture medium, respectively [32,48]. Transplanted BO-1 cells exhibit a marked STAT3 expression [35].

Meteorin was used to activate STAT3 in a concentration reported to induce astrocytic differentiation in mouse

embryonic forebrain neurospheres [51]. Notably, inhibition of STAT3 signalling in these meteorin-treated

neurospheres by STAT3 siRNA prevented an increased astrocytic differentiation [51]. In agreement with this, we

could show an increased percentage of p-STAT3-positive BO-1 cells in meteorin treated cultures, suggestive of

an activated STAT3 pathway. Furthermore, we observed an increased astrocytic differentiation of the BO-1 cells

when the meteorin application was combined with astrocytic differentiation medium. Meteorin treatment did not

alter the rate of proliferation nor the percentage of necrotic or apoptotic BO-1 cells, indicating a truly altered rate

of differentiation. Importantly, the meteorin-induced activation of the STAT3 pathway in primary rat OPCs

resulted in the anticipated switch-like effect with increased astrocytic differentiation in conjunction with reduced

oligodendrocytic differentiation when the meteorin application was combined with either proliferation- or

astrocytic differentiation medium.

In contrast, the concentration of STAT3 inhibitor VII, reported to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation in cultured

astrocytes [52], had to be reduced by 30-fold in order to decrease its anti-proliferative activity and prevent

necrosis of BO-1 cells in the present study. The concentration of the STAT3 inhibitor VII used here decreased the

percentage of p-STAT3-positive BO-1 cells in all three media. Combined with astrocytic differentiation medium

it also increased oligodendrocyte differentiation of BO-1 cells. The lack of any effects of STAT3 inhibitor VII on

the differentiation of primary rat OPCs could be due to the aforementioned lower concentration of this inhibitor

used in our experiments. Conclusively, the *in vitro* results support our hypothesis that activated STAT3 shifts the

differentiation of glial progenitors from an oligodendrocytic to an astrocytic fate. However, the interdependency

of meteorin and STAT inhibitor VII upon the used medium suggests that other still unknown signalling

Notably, meteorin-induced activation of STAT3 is thought to be mediated via the binding of meteorin to the common interleukin 6 (IL6) cytokine family co-receptor IL6 signal transducer (gp130) [51]. Therefore, in addition to activation of the JAK/STAT pathway itself, other pathways affected by gp130-activation including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-signalling and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1 (AKT)-signalling may also be involved in the control of glial differentiation [93].

In summary, TMEV-induced chronic progressive demyelinating leukomyelitis was accompanied by an increased population of intralesional NG2-positive OPCs and astrogliosis. GSEA suggested an association between OPCs and the JAK-STAT signalling cascade. Immunohistochemistry revealed an increased intralesional number of p-STAT3-positive cells co-expressing either GFAP, NG2, or CD107b. Meteorin-induced activation of STAT3-signalling in BO-1 cells and primary rat OPCs resulted in an enhanced GFAP- and reduced CNPase-expression in some of the tested media. In contrast, an oppositional result was observed in BO-1 cells treated with STAT3 inhibitor VII. These results suggest that STAT3 signalling represents an important factor shifting the differentiation of OPCs from an oligodendrocytic to an astrocytic fate, thereby simultaneously inducing remyelination failure and glial scarring in chronic progressive demyelinating TME.

Supplemental Table 1. Manually curated list of 229 genes involved in janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signalling. The table lists the probe set IDs, gene symbols, as well as the fold changes and p-values obtained at 14, 42, 98 and 196 days post infection. Bold numbers indicate a significant difference between TMEV- and Mock-infected SJL/JHanHsd as detected by Mann-Whitney U-test (p ≤ 0.05).

Supplemental Figure 1. Morphometric evaluation of immunohistological changes in the spinal cord in demyelinating Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis (TME). Box-and-whisker plots show the median and quartiles of the percentage of (A) myelin basic protein (MBP)-positive white matter area, (B) the density of nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2)-positive cells, (C) glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells, and (D) TMEV-antigen positive cells in the lesions and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) of TME virus (TMEV)- and mock-infected SJL/JHanHsd mice, respectively. Significant differences between the TMEV- and mock-infected groups as revealed by Mann-Whitney U-tests, and between normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and lesioned area within the TMEV-infected mice as detected by Wilcoxon signed rank tests are marked as follows: * p ≤ 0.05.

Supplemental Figure 2. Leading edge analysis of the 26 Gene Ontology (GO) terms significantly co-regulated with the density of nerve/glial antigen 2-positive oligodendroglial progenitor cells in the spinal cord in chronic demyelinating Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis as revealed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. The gene set graph points out that some of these GO terms display major overlap of the comprised genes. Color intensities show the overlap between subsets: the darker the color, the greater the overlap between the subsets.

Supplemental Figure 3. Rotarod performance in Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)- and mock-infected SJL/JCr1 mice. Box-and-whisker plots show the median and quartiles of the rod speed at the time of drop in revolutions per minute (rpm). The TMEV-infected mice display a chronic progressive decrease in motor performance in the demyelinating phase of the disease. Significant differences between the groups as detected by Mann-Whitney U-test are marked as follows: * p ≤ 0.05.
