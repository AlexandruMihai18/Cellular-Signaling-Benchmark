**Human innate immunity against African trypanosomes**

Etienne Pays and Benoit Vanhollebeke*

---

Humans are naturally resistant to infection by the African trypanosome prototype *Trypanosoma brucei brucei*, and only two variant clones of this parasite can avoid this innate immunity and cause sleeping sickness. The resistance to *T. brucei* is due to serum complexes associating apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA1) with two primate-specific proteins, apolipoprotein L-1 (apoL1) and haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr). We discuss recent advances on the respective functions of apoL1 and Hpr in this system. ApoL1 was found to share structural and functional similarities with proteins of the apoptotic Bcl2 family, and to kill trypanosomes through anionic pore formation in the lysosomal membrane of the parasite. In association with hemoglobin (Hb), Hpr was found to promote the binding of the trypanolytic complexes to a haptoglobin (Hp)-Hb receptor of the trypanosome surface, hereby facilitating the internalization of apoL1. Hpr or apoL1 deficiency respectively leads to the reduction or abolishment of human protection against *T. brucei*.

the evolutionary related *T. cruzi* or *Leishmania* species, African trypanosomes never enter into the cells of their host, but only multiply extracellularly in the blood and other fluids of the body. Their ability to sustain long-lasting chronic infection is due to an extraordinary capacity to undergo antigenic variation of their major surface protein, the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) [1]. The pathology linked to this infection is largely because of sustained chronic inflammation with elevated levels of TNF-α, and lethality is linked to parasite crossing of the blood-brain barrier. Parasitemia is associated with very strong T cell suppression and polyclonal activation of B cells, which lack memory and are involved in clearance of the successive trypanosome variants. The entire central belt of the continent is concerned, which roughly represents one-third of Africa. The number of deaths because of the disease probably exceeds the 30–50 000 cases reported each year, and the public health burden is severe on account of additional infection of other mammals, notably cattle, where the disease by the same parasites is known as Nagana. There is presently no satisfactory treatment, since the current drugs like melarsoprol kill 5–10% of the patients and vaccination is considered inconceivable because of the high antigenic variation potential of the parasite. The effect of age or ethnicity on infection is not clearly known. However, polymorphism of TNF-α and IL-10 could be predictive of relative susceptibility and resistance to the disease, respectively [2].

**Introduction**

Human African Trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a lethal disease owing to the infection by two subspecies of the protozoan flagellate *Trypanosoma brucei*, termed *T. b. rhodesiense* and *T. b. gambiense*, which are respectively endemic in Eastern and Western Africa. These parasites are transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Glossina flies, usually called tsetse flies. Their life-cycle alternates between proliferative infective forms and quiescent forms that are competent for cellular differentiation into the next developmental stage (Figure 1). As opposed to

The life-cycle of *T. brucei*. In the salivary glands of the tsetse fly vector, the trypanosomes are blocked in the G0/G1 phase of their cell cycle. These forms, termed metacyclics, are competent for cellular differentiation into proliferative slender bloodstream forms soon after being injected in mammalian blood following insect bite. Both metacyclic and slender forms are completely covered by a coat of VSG, whose continuous antigenic variation allows the parasite to sustain long-lasting chronic infection. Slender forms progressively transform into cell-cycle-arrested stumpy forms, which are competent for differentiation into procyclic forms soon after being taken up back in the fly. Procyclic forms actively proliferate in the insect midgut. Their surface coat is characterized by the replacement of VSG by another major surface protein termed procyclin. After a complex journey in the fly, the trypanosomes eventually differentiate into infective metacyclic forms.

debated [6]. This model was also challenged after the discovery of apoL1, a *bona fide* toxic complex constituent that remained unnoticed but accompanied Hpr in previous experiments. ApoL1 was identified through its specific binding to the *T. b. rhodesiense* protein neutralizing the trypanolytic activity of NHS, the serum resistance-associated protein SRA [7,8]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that recombinant apoL1 mimics all characteristics of trypanolysis by NHS, including its inability to kill *T. b. rhodesiense* owing to the inhibition by SRA [8]. The mechanism of lysis by either NHS or recombinant apoL1 was found to be anionic pore formation in the lysosomal membrane of the parasite, resulting in uncontrolled osmotic swelling of the lysosome [9].

With two players in the system, efforts in recent years centered on the elucidation of the precise contribution of either protein in the lysis process. The aim of this review is to summarize recent progresses in the field and to propose a coherent view on the origin, mode of action, and perspectives of this novel innate immunity system.

How many to kill a trypanosome: one, two, or more?

It has become clear that apoL1 is sufficient on its own to condemn the parasite, as pioneered by the observation that physiological amounts of recombinant apoL1 reproduced the phenotype of trypanosome lysis by NHS *in vitro* [8,9]. This observation was recently confirmed by two independent and complementary *in vivo* approaches that revealed that the serum of human patients lacking Hpr [10•] and that of transgenic mice expressing apoL1 but not Hpr [10•] both displayed full trypanolytic activity. Those experiments however revealed that the activity of apoL1 alone falls short of reflecting the full efficiency of the native toxic complexes.

To cope with this shortcoming, arguments have been presented to sustain the view that Hpr exerts synergistic toxicity with apoL1 [11–13]. The precise mechanism by which this synergy could operate was not defined, although a recent model based on *in vitro* studies with unilamellar liposomes suggested a dual permeabilization of the lysosomal membrane, through ion pore formation by apoL1 and lipid peroxidation by Hpr-linked Hb [13]. Different analyses failed to give support to this model. In the absence of apoL1, human or transgenic mouse sera exhibiting normal levels of HDL-bound Hpr did not exhibit any toxicity against trypanosomes during *in vivo* infection [10•,14•,15,16]. The possibility that Hpr toxicity would be revealed only in the context of apoL1-elicited lysis could also be ruled out [10•]. In addition, on theoretical

Current Opinion in Immunology 2009, 21:493–498 www.sciencedirect.com
grounds it is hard to conceive how Hpr and apoL1 could collaborate, while the toxicity of one protein relies on membrane breakdown and the other relies on its integrity. Evidence for the release of large macromolecules from the lysosome during lysis [12,17] does not necessarily imply the disruption of the lysosomal membrane. For instance the proapoptotic Bax protein, whose pore-forming domain shares striking similarities with that of apoL1 [18], is able to generate large pores that keep membranes intact, but allow the passage of cytochrome *c* through the mitochondrial outer membrane during apoptosis [19]. In addition, the evidence for considerable swelling of the lysosome during trypanolysis, implying the obvious conclusion that the lysosomal membrane is not disrupted during this process, was documented on both fixed and live cell populations [4,9,10*,20].

Another option was that Hpr is involved in targeting the toxic complex to the trypanosome surface [21]. In its absence the toxin apoL1 would enter the cell at strongly reduced kinetics through fluid phase endocytosis. Strong experimental confirmation of this proposal was recently provided by the discovery that Hb-bound Hpr is indeed a specific ligand for the parasite [12,22**].

So it appears that the toxic complex contains two essential components, a potent toxin that kills the parasite through ionic pore formation in the lysosomal membrane, and a targeting module that allows efficient delivery of the complex to the parasite. The efficiency of the system thus relies on the simultaneous presence of the two proteins on the same complexes. An important challenge will be to elucidate the mechanism responsible for this colocalization. As the absence of either protein appears to be without consequence on the other [10*], it would seem as if these proteins do not directly interact. Some evidence, based on hydrodynamic gene delivery in mice, seems to indicate that a third partner, human apoA1, might be required for proper association of the different components [14*].

### ApoLs are Bcl2-like proteins involved in cell death

The discovery that apoL1 was involved in trypanosome killing triggered extensive research on the structure and function of this protein. Before this finding the only known characteristics of apoL1 were that is was associated with some HDL particles [23] and that it was the only member of a family to be secreted extracellularly [24,25]. Unexpectedly, the apoLs turned out to share structural and functional similarities with the apoptotic proteins of the Bcl2 family [9,18]. Specifically, like Bcl2-like proteins the apoLs contain an N-terminal ionic pore-forming domain with the Bcl-homology signature BH3, and different apoLs can trigger the death of various eukaryotic cells [18,26,27*,28]. From the analysis of their expression profile, the activity of apoLs appears to be linked to inflammation in immune and endothelial cells [18]. Thus, in humans the secretion of this protein in the serum extended the role of Bcl2-like proteins from intracellular to extracellular killing activity.

#### Hpr facilitates apoL1 entry into trypanosomes through binding to an Hpr–Hb receptor

A major advance in recent years was the identification of the trypanosome receptor involved in the binding of the trypanolytic particles [22**]. First, the ligand of these particles was identified as being not Hpr alone, but the complex formed by Hb and either Hp [22**] or Hpr [12,22**]. This finding allowed the affinity purification of the receptor, which was termed TbHpHbR for *T. brucei* Hp–Hb receptor. Apart from the evidence for membrane anchoring and glycosylation, this protein did not exhibit any significant sequence feature. It displayed the same affinity for Hp–Hb as the CD163 receptor of macrophages, but in contrast to CD163 it equally recognized the Hpr–Hb complex. In nonhuman serum TbHpHbR was not essential for the parasite, but through the supply of heme derived from Hb it appeared to promote growth and contribute to the parasite resistance to the oxidative burst of host macrophages. In NHS this receptor was found responsible for the binding and uptake of Hb-charged trypanolytic HDLs through the recognition of the Hpr–Hb complex in these particles. Given the lytic potential of apoL1 for various cell types including mammalian cells [9,26,27*,28], the presence of this protein on the Hpr-bearing HDLs may have oriented evolution against the recognition of Hpr–Hb by CD163 [29].

#### The function of heme in bloodstream trypanosomes

In the absence of TbHpHbR, no cell-associated heme was detected in parasites isolated from mice, and in its presence heme accumulated following Hp–Hb uptake [22**]. Thus, the essential function of this receptor appeared to be the capture of heme for the incorporation into hemoproteins. So far heme was considered to be absent from trypanosome bloodstream forms, essentially because of the lack of obvious hemoproteins like catalase and cytochrome *c*. In fact recent reports have uncovered the presence of bloodstream form hemoproteins. An oleate desaturase appears to be involved in fatty acid desaturation, and the electrons required for this activity possibly originate from a cytochrome *b5* [30]. In addition, pharmacological evidences reveal the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoform lanosterol demethylase [31]. Our unpublished data actually suggest that this last protein could be the principal target for heme incorporation in bloodstream forms. Its involvement in trypanosome growth could relate to the sparking function of some sterols [32].

#### The origin of the trypanolytic factor

The trypanolytic potential of NHS involves two distinct proteins specific to African primates, and trypanolytic
activity is found only in African primates. The common ancestor that gave rise to humans, gorillas, and baboons appeared long after African trypanosomes in tsetse-infested regions [33]. Has the trypanolytic complex specifically evolved to escape infection by endemic parasites?

In agreement with this idea, some humans living in tsetse-free areas have lost the key components of the trypanolytic complex without obvious negative effects [15,34]. In addition, the trypanolytic capacity strikingly follows the exposure to the parasite vector. All positive animals are diurnal nonarboreal central African primates, being thus preferential targets for the bite of tsetse flies. Chimpanzees lack trypanocidal activity but their arboreal way of life might protect them from the parasite. Lytic activity is found in two groups of primates, gorillas and humans on the one hand, and baboons on the other hand [35,36]. The trypanolytic activity is essentially identical in all cases, suggesting a common system of innate immunity. However, an important difference discriminates the two groups: while baboon sera efficiently kill *T. b. rhodesiense*, NHS does not. Our unpublished data suggest that this difference is due to the sequence differences between human and baboon apoL1s.

It seems unlikely that the trypanolytic toxin apoL1 and the ligand Hpr would have appeared simultaneously. One of the two components could have appeared early in the old world monkeys and the other specifically in ancestors of the trypanolytic organisms. Accordingly, Hpr-coding sequences appear to be present in all old world monkeys, trypanolytic or not, as initially suggested [37]. So it is probable that HDL-bound Hpr has preceded the secretion of apoL1 in the serum.

### HDL-associated innate immunity

Although the trypanolytic factor could be a response to the presence of trypanosomes in Africa, its function could have evolved to cope with other challenges. A role related to innate immunity is likely, as the active components appear to be derived from or linked to immunity proteins. Hp is indeed an acute-phase protein, that is a plasma protein whose concentration is modulated by inflammation. Moreover, Hp is derived from a complement-associated protein, the mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease (MASP) [38]. In one of the two trypanolytic complexes, the Hp-derived Hpr is associated with another immunity component, IgM. Finally, apoL1 itself is strongly induced by inflammation [18]. So, the assembly of nonspecific innate immune components led to the development of a highly toxic supra-molecular immune complex (Figure 2). Given the pH dependency of apoL1 activity it can be anticipated that pathogens residing inside acidic compartments of host cells would represent preferential targets. Such could be the case of the intracellular parasite *Leishmania*, which seems par-

The HDL-associated trypanolytic complex of NHS. Besides the major apoA1 protein, the HDL3 fraction contains two primate-specific components, apoL1 and Hpr. ApoL1 is responsible for trypanosome killing through its anionic pore-forming capacity, which triggers uncontrolled osmotic swelling of the lysosome. In association with Hb that is provided by intravascular hemolysis, Hpr allows the efficient entry of the particles in the trypanosome through its binding to a parasite surface receptor for the Hp-Hb complex, termed TbHpHbR. This receptor cannot discriminate between Hp-Hb and Hpr-Hb. In *T. b. rhodesiense*, the VSG-like protein SRA neutralizes apoL1 through coil-coiling interaction with its C-terminal helix, allowing this parasite to resist human innate immunity and to develop sleeping sickness.

tially controlled by apoL1 in the parasitophorous vacuole of macrophages [39]. Moreover, detailed analysis of the evolution of the amino acid sequence of apoLs suggested that these proteins could have interacted with various pathogen components [40]. Innate immunity linked to HDL-bound apoL1 could thus represent a rapid and efficient system to combat systemic or local infection, at least by protozoan parasites.

### Conclusions

Presumably as an adaptation to local parasites, African primates including humans have acquired innate resistance to *T. brucei*. Two primate-specific proteins linked to inflammation, apoL1 and Hpr, are involved in this process. After a long-standing debate regarding the respective roles played by these proteins, recent advances have allowed the proposal of a coherent model for their trypanolytic activity. The two proteins are carried by the same macromolecular structures, in particular HDL3 particles. In these complexes apoL1 is the sole toxin and its killing capacity results from ionic pore formation in the lysosomal membrane of the parasite. As apoLs appear to share structural and functional similarities with proteins of the apoptotic Bcl2 family, including the presence of a BH3 signature and their ability to trigger cell
death, it would seem that the original function of programmed cell death was diverted here to kill pathogens. Hpr is involved, together with Hb, in the specific binding of the complexes to a surface receptor of the parasite. Originally this receptor was responsible for efficient capture of Hp–Hb, the heme component of which is necessary for the activity of hemoproteins promoting the parasite growth and resistance to the oxidative response of macrophages. In human serum, the presence of Hpr on the apoL1-bearing particles has diverted the original function of the Hp–Hb receptor into that of efficient way to internalize apoL1. Hpr was initially proposed to be the trypanolytic component of human serum, but apart from a facilitating role for apoL1 intake no involvement in trypanosome killing was observed *in vivo*.

Perspectives include the use of apoL1 to treat human sleeping sickness and the cattle disease nagana. Through site-directed mutagenesis of the interactive C-terminal helix of apoL1, we have generated apoL1 mutants no longer able to interact with the *T. b. rhodesiense* antidote protein SRA (B Vanhollebeke *et al.*, unpublished data). In transgenic mice these apoL1 variants efficiently inhibited infection by *T. b. brucei* and *T. b. rhodesiense*, as well as infection by other related trypanosomes such as *T. congolense*. Therefore, it is conceivable to generate transgenic cattle that would resist infection by African trypanosomes and would be productive in endemic areas. Similarly, these apoL1 variants are expected to cure human infection by *T. b. rhodesiense*, although transforming this idea into an effective drug obviously represents a major challenge.

This paper reports the unexpected discovery of a trypanosome receptor for the Hp-Hb complex. The role of this receptor is to allow the capture of heme for incorporation into hemoproteins that promote parasite growth and resistance to the oxidative response by host macrophages. In NHS, the presence of Hpr-Hb on apoL1-bearing HDL particles triggers the binding of these particles to the receptor, hence the active uptake of apoL1 and trypanosome lysis. Thus, these findings explained the paradox of parasites having a specific surface receptor for the internalization of a lytic factor.
