Genetic analysis of the mammalian cell death machinery

Nicholas J oza, Guido Kroemer and Josef M. Penninger

Programmed cell death is used by multicellular organisms to eliminate excess, damaged or harmful cells. This process of cell suicide, defined in morphological terms as apoptosis, is crucial for developmental morphogenesis, tissue homeostasis and defense against pathogens. Over the past decade, our understanding of the genetic basis of the cell death machinery has grown exponentially using genetically modified organisms. In particular, inactivation of genes involved in cell death using homologous recombination in mice has provided an invaluable tool to understand the mechanisms, as well as the structural and functional consequences, of programmed cell death in mammals. This review discusses recent insights into the cellular death program as revealed by these mutant animals.

Programmed cell death (PCD) serves to remove superfluous, damaged or harmful cells in a wide variety of physiological contexts. The vast majority of cells, for example neurons unable to form synaptic connections with their targets or immature lymphocytes that lack appropriate receptor specificities, are extinguished by PCD during mammalian embryogenesis. PCD is crucial for tissue morphogenesis (e.g. for the hollowing-out of solid structures to form tubes), for the elimination of structures not needed in the mature organism during insect and amphibian metamorphosis, and for maintaining cellular homeostasis [1,2]. It is also becoming increasingly clear that the pathogenesis of many human diseases, from neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders to neoplasia, can be caused by dysregulation of cell death [3].

The core apoptotic program

The term ‘apoptosis’ was originally coined to describe the morphological attributes of dying vertebrate cells, which include cell shrinkage, chromatin compaction, blebbing of membrane-enclosed cellular debris, and preservation of organellar ultrastructural integrity [4]. The existence of a genetically controlled suicide program that underlies the apoptotic morphology was first elucidated through studies in *Caenorhabditis elegans*. In genetic screens for genes that regulated cell death, Horvitz and colleagues demonstrated that the physiological death of 131 cells, out of the 1090 cells generated during the nematode’s development, was controlled by at least three gene products: CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9 (reviewed in Ref. [5]). Loss-of-function mutations in *ced-3* or *ced-4*, or gain-of-function for *ced-9*, blocked normally occurring cell death. Subsequent biochemical studies revealed that these proteins functioned as a ternary complex, in which activation of the protease CED-3 by the adapter protein CED-4 is normally repressed by the anti-apoptotic CED-9. In cells destined to die, expression of EGL-1 results in displacement of CED-4, activation of CED-3, and cellular demise.

Core components of this apoptotic program have been conserved in mammals and in *Drosophila melanogaster* (reviewed in Refs [6,7]) (Fig. 1). CED-4 shares homology with the fly protein Dark/Dapaf-1/HAC-1 and mammalian Apaf-1. CED-9 is homologous to the anti-apoptotic members of the growing mammalian Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and others), and EGL-1 shares homology with the ‘BH3-only’ proteins, a class of death effectors that bear structural similarity to the Bcl-2 family in a motif termed the bcl-2-homology domain 3 (BH3). Thus far, no fly counterparts to EGL-1 and CED-9 have been found, although a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homolog, named dBorg-1/dBok/Debcl/Drob-1, has been identified [8]. Finally, CED-3 shares homology with a class of intracellular cysteine proteases known as caspases. During cell death, caspases are converted from their inactive pro-enzymatic forms into activated killers, and are responsible for many of the morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis [9].

Despite the remarkable degree of evolutionary conservation among these three model organisms, unsurprisingly the apoptotic machinery in flies and vertebrates is significantly more elaborate. In mammals, anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family members serve principally to stabilize mitochondrial membranes and prevent leakage of apoptotic effectors, such as cytochrome c, into the cytosol. An apoptotic role for cytochrome c in *D. melanogaster* has also been demonstrated [7]. However, there is no evidence that mitochondria control apoptosis in *C. elegans*; rather, CED-9 functions to inhibit cell death by direct suppression of CED-4-mediated activation of CED-3. In addition, unlike worms, flies and vertebrates have evolved multiple caspases, each with specialized roles in cell death. The 15 caspases identified thus far in mammals function in a hierarchical proteolytic cascade consisting of initiators and effectors (Table 1). Initiators (caspases-2, -8, -9 and -10) are activated by adapter-facilitated self-cleavage directly in response to apoptotic stimuli, whereas downstream effectors (caspases-3, -6 and -7) are activated through proteolytic processing by initiators and are responsible for degrading specific cellular components and ultimately cell death [9].

Death receptor signaling
Although cell death can be triggered by a vast array of stimuli, the manner by which all apoptotic signals engage the cell death machinery falls under two broad categories. One pathway involves triggering cell surface 'death receptors', a specialized subset of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) superfamily, which includes Fas/CD95, TNF-receptor 1 (TNF-R1), and death receptor 3 (DR3) (Fig. 2). Upon receptor aggregation by ligand, intracellular adapter proteins such as FADD/MORT1, TRADD and RAIDD are recruited to the cytoplasmic regions of the receptors through homotypic death-domain (DD) interactions to form a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) [10]. In turn, FADD recruits pro-caspase-8 via interactions between death-effector-domains (DEDs) present in both proteins, thereby stimulating caspase-8 autoproteolytic activation and initiating a caspase cascade leading to cell death [10].

The pivotal roles of the adapter FADD and the proximal caspase-8 in transducing death receptor signals were established from analyses of cell lines derived from FADD⁻/⁻ and caspase-8⁻/⁻ mice [11, 12]. In response to Fas, TNF-R1 or DR3 stimulation, FADD⁻/⁻ and caspase-8⁻/⁻ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) failed to undergo cell death. Similarly, FADD⁻/⁻ thymocytes were resistant to Fas-induced cell death [13]. However, FADD⁻/⁻ and caspase-8⁻/⁻ fibroblasts remained sensitive to agents, such as chemotherapeutic drugs, that utilize the mitochondrial death pathway, indicating crucial yet selective roles for FADD and caspase-8 downstream of death receptors [11, 12].

Like caspase-8, caspase-2 has been shown to associate with the cytoplasmic regions of death receptors, and this association requires the interaction of caspase-2 with the molecular adapter RAIDD/CRADD [14, 15]. However, caspase-2 could not functionally compensate for caspase-8 deficiency in response to Fas, TNF-R1 or DR3 stimulation [12]. Moreover, T and B lymphoblasts and thymocytes from caspase-2⁻/⁻ mice remained sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis [16]. Instead, oocytes deficient in caspase-2 were resistant to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis, and knockout female mice accumulate excess oocytes in their ovaries, demonstrating a tissue-specific role for caspase-2 in cell death and cellular homeostasis [16].

The mammalian proteins that participate in cell death activation and execution, and homologous proteins in *Caenorhabditis elegans* and *Drosophila*. Asterisks indicate an indirect interaction: in mammals, and probably in flies, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins principally prevent against release of cytochrome c (cytc), thereby preventing cyt c/apaf-1/dark-mediated activation of caspases.

Unlike FADD and caspase-8, Casper/c-FLIP, the cellular homolog of the v-FLIP family of viral anti-apoptotic proteins, serves to abrogate the signal transduction events downstream of death receptor engagement (Fig. 2). The full-length Casper protein possesses two DEDs and a defective caspase-like domain. Because Casper can associate with the DEDs of FADD and caspase-8, it has been implicated as an inhibitor of apoptosis by interfering with the recruitment of caspase-8 to FADD. In line with these observations, Casper⁻/⁻ MEFs were found to be highly sensitive to cell death induced by TNF-R1 and Fas stimulation, demonstrating a cytoprotective role for Casper against death ligand-induced apoptosis [17].

In contrast to mice deficient in Fas or TNF-R1, which manifest defects in immune system homeostasis and pathogen clearance, gene disruption of FADD results in embryonic lethality at embryonic day 10–11 [11]. FADD-mutant embryos display thinning of the myocardium and abdominal hemorrhaging. Curiously,

Fig. 2. Overview of apoptotic signaling in mammalian cells. Engagement of 'death receptors' (e.g. Fas) initiates recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 to the cytoplasmic regions of the receptor. Caspase-8 is autocatalytically activated and activates terminal caspases-3, -6 and -7. Once activated, these cleave select intracellular targets ultimately leading to the phenotypic manifestations of apoptosis. In this context, Casper antagonizes death receptor signaling by interfering with caspase-8 recruitment to the receptor. An array of other apoptotic stimuli use mitochondrial dysfunction to signal apoptosis. In response to specific death stimuli, distinct 'BH3-only' proteins, such as Bid and Bim, are activated. Activation of these proteins might involve proteolytic cleavage (in the case of Bid) or disengagement from sequestering proteins (in the case of Bim and its sequestration by dynein light chain LC8). BH3-only proteins subsequently translocate to mitochondrial surfaces, where they associate with multidomain Bcl-2-related proteins. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL) are inactivated, and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members (e.g. Bax, Bak) are activated to potentially form mitochondrial membrane-spanning pores themselves or to interact with pre-existing membrane channels. Release of cytochrome c (cyt c) induces formation of the apoptosome in association with Apaf1 and caspase 9. AIF induces hallmarks of apoptosis independent of caspases. Smac/DIABLO inactivates 'inhibitor of apoptosis proteins' (IAPs), thereby derepressing caspases. ER stress induces activation of caspase-12, perhaps cross-talking with the mitochondrial pathway.

apoptosis and cellular proliferation, as determined by TUNEL staining and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, respectively, were not significantly different between mutant and wild-type embryonic hearts [11]. It is also interesting that caspase-8⁻/⁻ and Casper⁻/⁻ mice died at a similar stage of gestation and exhibited similar abnormalities in heart development [11,12,17]. These findings highlight an unexpected, additional role for FADD, caspase-8, and Casper in transducing developmental signals required for proper formation of the heart and embryonic survival. The signaling pathways and the receptor(s) implicated in FADD-, caspase-8- and Casper-mediated heart morphogenesis remain elusive.

Another unexpected role for FADD was uncovered in analyses of FADD-deficient T and B cells, derived by complementing RAG-1⁻/⁻ blastocysts with FADD⁻/⁻ ES cells [13]. FADD⁻/⁻ thymocytes were partially blocked at the early CD4⁻CD8⁻ progenitor stage, and no IgM⁺IgD⁺B cells could be detected in bone marrow or spleen. Peripheral T cells were resistant to proliferation induced by concanavalin A or anti-CD3 antibody treatment. Similarly, in studies using transgenic mice overexpressing dominant-negative FADD, a profound inhibition of activation-induced proliferation was also observed in thymocytes and mature T cells [18,19]. Thus, in addition to signaling for cell death, it appears that FADD is crucial for transducing cell survival/proliferation signals in certain cellular contexts.

The mitochondrial apoptosome

Whereas death receptors respond to instructive signals from neighboring cells or soluble ligands, an alternative cell death pathway depends on mitochondrial dysfunction and is initiated in response to primarily cell-intrinsic cues (Fig. 2). An array of intracellular stimuli including DNA damage, glucocorticoids, perturbations in redox balance, ceramide generation, and loss of growth factor signals

can trigger permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and leakage of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic effectors into the cytosol [20, 21]. One such effector is cytochrome c, which stimulates assembly of a ternary complex, called the mitochondrial ‘apoptosome’, that consists of cytochrome c, apaf-1 and caspase-9. Cytosolic cytochrome c binds tightly to, and induces oligomerization of, the adapter protein apaf-1, which subsequently recruits pro-caspase-9. In turn, caspase-9 is activated autolytically and triggers activation of caspase-3.

In line with these biochemical observations, mice with a targeted disruption of apaf-1, caspase-9 or caspase-3 demonstrate similar developmental abnormalities: perinatal lethality, hyperplasia of the CNS and protrusions of brain tissue through the skull vault, consequent to decreased programmed cell death of neuroepithelial progenitors [22–27]. As expected, caspase-3 was not activated in the brains from apaf-1−/− and caspase-9−/− mice [24, 27]. However, caspase-9−/− mice were more severely affected than caspase-3−/− mice, and apaf-1−/− mice displayed developmental defects associated with impaired apoptosis in other physiological compartments, including craniofacial abnormalities, delayed removal of interdigital webs, and retinal hyperplasia. These findings suggest that caspase-3 is not the only substrate for caspase-9, and that caspase-9 is not the only binding partner for apaf-1. Of note, besides caspase-9, activation of caspases-8 and -2 is also attenuated in apaf-1−/− thymocytes treated with dexamethasone or etoposide [26]. It has also been shown that caspases -2, -6 and -7 are activated exclusively in caspase-9 knockout mice but not in wild type in response to UV and γ irradiation [28]. These findings suggest that, in the absence of caspase-9, apaf-1-mediated activation of downstream caspases might use alternative initiator caspases in a redundant or compensatory manner.

As mentioned above, assembly of the apoptosome is triggered by cytochrome c (cytc), a component, in healthy cells, of the electron transfer chain and involved in mitochondrial respiration. Not unexpectedly, genetic inactivation of cytochrome c resulted in embryonic death due to mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction [29]. Cytc−/− embryos survived to embryonic day 10, and were able to form differentiated tissues from all three germ layers, a primitive heart tube, somites, and an allantois. Cytochrome-c-deficient embryonic cell lines, established under culture conditions that compensated for the respiratory defect, exhibited impaired caspase-3 activation and apaf-1 oligomerization in response to intrinsic death stimuli. These cyt c−/− cells were resistant to apoptosis induced by UV radiation and the kinase inhibitor staurosporine, as determined by assays for DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation, and maintained their clonogenic potential after exposure to these stimuli. Cytc−/− cell lines were also partially resistant to the pro-apoptotic effects of serum

withdrawal but readily underwent cell death in response to death receptor ligands such as TNF-α. In line with the fact that apaf-1−/− and caspase-9−/− cell lines are resistant to intrinsic death signals such as γ radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs but sensitive to extrinsic stimuli such as Fas stimulation [24–27], these findings indicate an important role for the cytochrome c → apaf-1 → caspase-9 → caspase-3 pathway in cell death in response to mitochondrially-regulated (intrinsic) death signals.

Alternative mitochondrial apoptotic pathways Although these knockout mice demonstrate dramatic apoptotic defects, it is clear that there are apoptotic pathways that compensate functionally for these gene deficiencies. The development of many organs and structures besides the CNS is not greatly, if at all, perturbed. For instance, interdigital webs are removed, although delayed by one day, and thymocyte development (including negative selection of self-reactive cells) is apparently normal in apaf-1-deficient mice (H. Yoshida, pers. commun.). Curiously, depending on genetic background, caspase-3−/− mice and 5% of apaf-1−/− mice can survive to adulthood, exhibiting few or no gross histological abnormalities in the brain or other tissues [30]. Furthermore, it is surprising, given the crucial role of cytochrome c in apoptosome assembly, that cyt c−/− embryos survived to mid-gestation, long after much developmentally programmed cell death has occurred.

Possible candidates for participation in a redundant cell death pathway are the mitochondrial cell death effectors endonuclease G and Smac/Diablo and the recently discovered HtrA2/Omi [31, 32]. Smac/Diablo and HtrA2/Omi are released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space during apoptosis and promote cell death by inactivating inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), thereby releasing caspases from inhibition by IAPs [31, 32] (Fig. 2). IAPs have been shown to block cell death induced by a variety of pro-apoptotic agents, including chemotherapeutic drugs, UV radiation and overexpression of Bax or caspases [33]. Loss-of-function mutations in diap1, one of several known IAP homologs in Drosophila, leads to embryonic lethality due to unrestrained caspase activity [6]. By contrast, fly embryos bearing a homozygous deletion spanning the reaper, grim and hid genes, which encode functional counterparts to Smac and Omi, display essentially no apoptosis [6]. Despite the importance of IAPs, reaper, grim and hid in Drosophila, the physiological relevance of their mammalian homologs remains to be determined.

Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF): a novel mitochondrial cell death pathway A recently identified participant in an alternate cell death pathway is the mitochondrial flavoprotein AIF, which translocates from mitochondria to nuclei during apoptotic conditions and induces caspase-independent chromatin condensation and large-scale (50 kb) DNA

AIF-knock-out (AIF$^{-/Y}$) ES cells were partially resistant to apoptosis in response to serum withdrawal and resistant to apoptosis in response to the oxidative stress inducer menadione when cotreated with caspase inhibitors [38]. In contrast to cytochrome $c^{-/-}$, apaf-1$^{-/-}$ and caspase-9$^{-/-}$ cells, AIF mutant cells were sensitive to other mitochondrially regulated death stimuli such as the DNA-damaging agent etoposide. Together, these findings indicate a stimulus-dependent contribution of AIF to apoptotic signaling. In response to certain apoptotic stimuli, AIF cooperates with, or functionally substitutes for, the cytochrome c (apoptosome) pathway, whereas in others, AIF is not crucial (Fig. 3). The exact hierarchies and cross-talks between AIF and the cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 apoptosome in cell type- and death signal-specific apoptosis need to be determined. Although the mechanism of action of AIF remains largely unknown, some clues have recently emerged. Hsp70, which is upregulated as a consequence of cellular stress, was demonstrated to exert part of its cytoprotective function by specifically interacting with and inhibiting AIF [39].

Apoptosis-inducing factor and mammalian development PCD is essential during mammalian development; it is crucial for processes such as the sculpting of digits, the fusion of the palatal shelves, the hollowing-out of solid structures to form tubes, and the elimination of misplaced or abnormal cells [1]. Perhaps the earliest requirement for PCD in the embryogenesis of mammals is during the formation of the proamniotic cavity, which occurs in the mouse by embryonic day 6 [40]. Cavitation occurs as cells of the inner core undergo apoptosis in response to signals emanating from the outer endoderm. This developmental process can be recapitulated *in vitro* by generating ES cell-derived embryoid bodies (EBs), multicellular structures that exhibit all the differentiated cell types found in the early mouse embryo, and that spontaneously undergo cavitation [40]. We investigated the role of AIF in this cell death process using AIF-targeted ES cells. Although AIF$^{+/Y}$ ES cells were able to differentiate into various tissues *in vitro* and *in vivo*, AIF-deficient EBs were unable to form cavities due to impaired death of cells in the inner core [38]. By contrast, cavitation and cell death occurred readily in EBs derived from apaf-1- or caspase-9-deficient ES cells. This cell death displayed morphological features of apoptosis, as membrane blebbing and partial chromatin condensation still occurred, although the downstream caspase-3 was not activated. These findings reveal an unexpected and important role for AIF in EB cavitation, a process that can be uncoupled from requirements for apaf-1, caspase-9 and caspase-3.

The results in embryoid bodies indicate that the genetic inactivation of AIF abolishes the first wave of developmental cell death occurring during early mouse embryogenesis. Assuming that ontogenesis recapitulates phylogeny, it is tempting to speculate that AIF represents a pathway of apoptosis that

Fig. 3. A model for the stimulus-specific role of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) in apoptosis. Certain apoptotic stimuli, including DNA damage and kinase inhibitors such as staurosporine, require caspases and appear to induce cell death independent of AIF. In response to oxidative stress, caspases and AIF are functionally redundant. Lastly, apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) is required for early embryonic morphogenesis and for apoptosis induced by deprivation of growth factors. Since AIF$^{-/Y}$ embryonic stem cells are only partially resistant to serum withdrawal, AIF could cooperate with caspases to effect cell death. The molecular control for these three hypothetical pathways remains to be determined.

cleavage [34]. AIF is expressed ubiquitously and exhibits significant homology to oxidoreductases from other vertebrates (*Xenopus laevis*), non-vertebrates (*C. elegans*, *D. melanogaster*), plants, fungi, eubacteria and archaeabacteria [35].

In addition to its nuclear apoptotic effects, cell-free assays have demonstrated that AIF can induce permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes and trigger release of cytochrome c, suggesting that AIF might participate in a positive feedback loop with the cytochrome c/caspase (apoptosome) pathway [34]. In HeLa cells induced to die by interaction between their CD4/CXCR4 surface molecules and the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein complex, neutralization of AIF by injection of anti-AIF antibodies prevented nuclear apoptosis and cytochrome c release [36].

By contrast, other observations argue against a role for AIF upstream of the cytochrome c/caspase pathway. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with staurosporine, AIF neutralization using anti-AIF antibodies abolished apoptosis only when the apoptosome/caspase-3/CAD pathway was simultaneously blocked by genetic inactivation of either Apaf1 or caspase-3, by addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk, or by microinjection of ICAD, an inhibitor of the caspase-3-activated DNase CAD [37]. In addition, apoptosis triggered by overexpressed AIF was not blocked in fibroblasts deficient for apaf-1 or caspase-3. These data indicate the coexistence of two separate and redundant pathways linking mitochondria to apoptosis, one that utilizes AIF and the other that relies on apoptosome-mediated caspase activation.

because they possess only the bcl-2-homology 3
domain (BH 3) and otherwise bear no similarity to the
Bcl-2 family, serve as ligands to activate multidomain
pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members or inactivate
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members [46]. BH 3-only proteins
include Bim, Bid, Bad, Bik/Nbk, BNIP3, Blk, Noxa,
Puma, and Hrk. Alterations in expression, subcellular
localization, phosphorylation status, and proteolytic
processing of Bcl-2 family molecules determine
whether the death program will be activated.
Gene targeting of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members has demonstrated that some of these
molecules have unique and nonredundant functions
in cell death (reviewed in Ref.[47]) (Table 2). For
instance, bcl-2−/− mice display impaired renal
function and undergo premature loss of mature
lymphocytes resulting in immunodeficiency. Bcl-x−/−
mice die at E13, displaying massive neuronal cell
death in the brain, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia
and in erythroid cells of the fetal liver. Maturation of
T and B cells was also impaired due to increased
apoptosis of immature lymphoid precursors. Mice
deficient in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-w show
failed adult spermatogenesis and A1-deficient mice
exhibit accelerated neutrophil apoptosis. These
disparate phenotypes could reflect differences in
tissue distribution of Bcl-2 family members. For
instance, among the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 genes, it
appears that only bcl-w is expressed in
spermatogonia from adult mice [48].
The fact that Bcl-2-related proteins can have
functionally overlapping roles was clearly
demonstrated in mice doubly deficient for the pro-
apoptotic molecules Bax and Bak. Bak−/− mice display
no overt abnormalities and Bax−/− mice show a
limited phenotype restricted to a developmental
block in sperm production and slight increases in
sympathetic and motor neurons and lymphocytes
[49]. Neurons from Bax-deficient neonates are
resistant to apoptosis resulting from nerve growth
factor deprivation and axon disconnection from their
targets [50]. However, deletion of both gene products
resulted in a diverse spectrum of abnormalities
including perinatal lethality, morphological and
neurological perturbations, and massive lymphoid
hyperplasia [51]. Most Bax−/−Bak−/− double mutant
mice die soon after birth, apparently as a result of
failure to nurse, which might result from their
unresponsiveness to auditory stimulation [51].
Interdigital webs persist into adulthood and females
maintain an imperforate vagina. Spleens and lymph
nodes are massively enlarged due to accumulations of
myeloid and lymphoid cells, and small neuronal cells
accumulate in the periventricular areas of the brain.
Thus, Bax and Bak play functionally overlapping
roles in apoptosis and are crucial for multiple aspects
of cellular homeostasis and tissue morphogenesis.
Bax Bak double knockout MEFs proved strikingly
resistant to a wide range of intrinsic death stimuli,
including staurosporine, etoposide, UV radiation and

Fig. 4. The Bcl-2 family. Members of the Bcl-2 family share variable amounts of conserved BH (Bcl-2
homology) sequence motifs, and can be classified into three groups based on structure-function analyses:
'multidomain' anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic members, and 'BH 3-only' pro-apoptotic members.
BH 3-only proteins trigger cell death through binding to the receptor domain of multidomain Bcl-2 family
members, thereby mediating suppression (of the anti-apoptotics) or activation (of the pro-apoptotics).

pre-dates that involving the caspases. Although
putative homologs to AIF have been found in all
metazoan phyla [35], no evidence for caspases has been
reported in plants, fungi, or unicellular organisms such
as the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, all of which can
undergo PCD [1]. The physiologically mediated cell
death of stalk cells in the slime mold Dictyostelium
discoideum under conditions of starvation does not
require activation of caspases [41]. A slime mold
apoptotic effector with significant structural and
functional homology to AIF has been identified recently
[42]. In addition, the parasitic protozoan T. cruzi
undergoes several features characteristic of apoptosis
during in vitro differentiation from the epimastigote
to trypomastigote stages. At least with Trypanosoma
brucei brucei, caspase inhibitors cannot block this cell
death [43]. Thus, AIF and the AIF-regulated cell death
pathway could constitute an ancient and conserved
process required for the morphogenesis of multicellular
and unicellular organisms.

Bcl-2 gene family: regulators of cell death
Bcl-2-related proteins are crucial regulators of
apoptosis, integrating competing death and survival
signals to determine whether the cell death machinery
is activated (reviewed in Refs [8, 44]) (Fig. 2). The
growing Bcl-2 family consists of 'multidomain' death
antagonists (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, A1) and
death agonists (e.g. Bax, Bak, Bok), which function
primarily to protect or disrupt the integrity of
mitochondrial membranes, respectively (Fig. 4). As
suggested by protein crystallography and by analyses
of liposomes reconstituted with purified components,
these proteins regulate the mitochondrial membrane
barrier by forming channels themselves or influencing
pre-existing channels in the membrane [45]. Another
class of death effectors, called 'BH 3-only' proteins

Table 2. Characteristics of knockout mice with defects in apoptosis

| Knockout | Phenotype | Refs |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Adapters | FADD/Mort 1 | Lethality at E10-11; impaired heart development and hemorrhaging; MEFs resistant to Fas, TNF-R1 and DR3 stimulation; B-and T-cell development perturbed; mature T cells refractive to mitogen-and antigen-induced proliferation. | [11, 13] |
| Casper/c-FLIP | Lethality at E10-11; impaired heart development; MEFs exhibit increased sensitivity to FasL-and TNF-induced apoptosis. | [17] |
| Apaf-1 | Perinatal lethal; defective neuronal apoptosis, brain malformations, craniofacial abnormalities, retinal hyperplasia; ES cells, MEFs and thymocytes are resistant to cytotoxic drugs; impaired cell death and defective activation of caspases-2, -3 and -8 in dexamethasone-treated thymocytes. | [26, 27, 30] |
| Mitochondrial death effectors | Cytochrome c | Lethality after E10; cell lines resistant to UV irradiation, staurosporine and growth factor deprivation; caspase-3 activation and apaf-1 oligomerization are not elicited in response to these stimuli. | [29] |
| AIF | Embryoid bodies do not undergo apoptosis-mediated cavitation; ES cells are partially resistant to serum withdrawal. | [38] |
| Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members | Bcl-2 | Viable; progressive morbidity and premature lethality; impaired kidney function and massive apoptotic involution of mature lymphoid system. | [47] |
| Bcl-X | Lethality at E13; massive cell death in CNS and of immature lymphocytes. | [47] |
| A1 | Viable; increased neutrophil apoptosis. | [47] |
| Bcl-w | Viable; males are infertile due to aspermato genesis. | [47] |
| Mcl-1 | Lethal at peri-implantation stage; embryos fail to implant in uterus and maturation beyond pre-compaction stage is impaired. | [58] |
| Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members | Bax | Viable; failed spermatogenesis; neurons survive NGF deprivation and axotomy. | [49, 50] |
| Bax, Bak | Perinatal lethal; neurological defects, persistence of interdigital webs, imperforate vagina, excess numbers of cells in CNS and hematopoietic system; mice are resistant to Fas-induced liver degeneration; MEFs are completely resistant to a wide range of apoptotic stimuli utilizing the mitochondrial pathway, including tBid overexpression, growth factor deprivation, staurosporine, etoposide, UV irradiation; resistant to ER stress-induced cell death. | [51, 52] |
| Bid | Viable; resistant to Fas-induced hepatocellular apoptosis; cells are partially resistant to Fas stimulation (thymocytes, hepatocytes) and TNF(MEFs); cytc release, caspase activation delayed in response to these death stimuli. | [54] |
| Bim | Prenatal lethality (partially penetrant); thymocyte development and hematopoietic homeostasis is perturbed; autoimmune kidney disease; lymphocytes are resistant to cytokine deprivation, calcium ionophores and microtubule disruption. | [55] |
| IAPs | XIAP | No developmental or apoptotic phenotype. | [59] |

serum deprivation [52]. Double knockout MEFs were also resistant to various endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses, indicating that Bax and Bak might function at sites on the ER, or that ER stress might converge on the mitochondrial pathway. As caspase-12 localizes to the ER and is crucial for ER stress-induced cell death [53], Bax and Bak could functionally interact with this caspase. Furthermore, the apoptotic resistance of Bax/Bak double knockout MEFs appears even more pronounced than that observed in apaf-1- or caspase-9-deficient cells, consistent with Bcl-2 family members functioning upstream of mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the fact that Bax⁻/⁻Bak⁻/⁻mice do not demonstrate the exencephaly of apaf-1⁻/⁻and caspase-9⁻/⁻mice suggests there exists additional redundancy among Bcl-2 family members, perhaps mediated by Bok.

demonstrated that mitochondria are crucial amplifiers of extrinsic death stimuli in certain cell types [54]. The pro-apoptotic effects of Bid are exerted through Bax and Bak because Bax/Bak double knockout mice were similarly resistant to Fas-induced hepatocellular apoptosis, and double knockout MEFs were resistant to the toxic effects of tBid overexpression [52]. Thus, Bax and Bak represent an essential gateway for many, if not all, intrinsic death stimuli, and extrinsic death stimuli in cell types requiring involvement of mitochondria. In its latent form, the BH3-only protein Bim is sequestered to the microtubule-associated dynein motor complex through association with the dynein light chain LC8 [46]. Apoptotic signals stimulate the translocation of Bim to the mitochondrial compartment. Bim⁻/⁻mice are born at reduced mendelian ratios, demonstrate increased numbers of leukocytes, and by one year of age are progressing towards a fatal systemic autoimmune disease, characterized by high titers of IgG autoantibodies, immune complex glomerulonephritis, vasculitis and kidney dysfunction [55]. Bim-deficient immature T cells and B cells were resistant to cytokine deprivation, ionomycin and taxol-induced disruption of microtubules, and activated T lymphoblasts survived in the absence of the crucial growth and survival factor interleukin-2. Thus, Bim is required for a cell to respond to certain apoptotic stimuli, for leukocyte homeostasis and as a barrier to

BH3-only proteins: sensors of death stimuli  
BH3-only proteins are important sentinels of cellular damage, connecting death stimuli to the multidomain Bcl-2 family members and apoptosis machinery [46]. For instance, in certain cell types such as hepatocytes, triggering of Fas results in the caspase-8-mediated cleavage of BH3-only protein Bid to its active form tBid, followed by its redistribution to mitochondria where it associates with multidomain Bcl-2-like proteins and disrupts mitochondrial integrity [8].

autoimmunity. Recently, Bim and Bad were shown to function through a Bax/Bak-controlled mitochondrial pathway, as MEFs deficient in both Bax or Bak were resistant to overexpression of activated forms of Bim or Bad [56]. This further broadens the list of apoptotic responses regulated by Bax and Bak.

**Perspectives**

PCD is a crucial property of multicellular and perhaps unicellular organisms. Recent experiments

in mutant mice have shown that nature has evolved numerous apoptotic pathways and effectors that have unique as well as overlapping functional roles. The regulation, crosstalk and precise roles of these pathways will be a source for future investigation. Identification of the molecular players that control cell death in development might allow us to modify cell death pathways in human diseases such as diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.
