**Regulation of B lymphocyte activation by complement C3 and the B cell coreceptor complex**

Robert C Rickert

Complement is an essential innate immune mechanism that recognizes and eradicates microbes and associated toxins. In addition, complement receptors (CD21 and CD35) on B cells cooperate with the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) to efficiently recognize and respond to antigens bearing complement C3d(g). Fixation of C3d(g) to antigen confers adjuvant properties and therefore its deposition may need to be carefully regulated to avoid autoreactivity. CD21 and/or CD35 engagement is nonmitogenic, and B-cell activation via BCR-CD21 coligation is enhanced through the recruitment of CD19. Recent efforts have sought a better understanding of the topological and biochemical properties of BCR and coreceptor (CD19–CD21–CD81) signaling, as well as the context for complement activation in the response to foreign and self antigens.

**Introduction**

Complement activation is an essential component of the early response to infection. Rapidly generated complement cleavage products recruit and activate effector cells and promote the lysis or phagocytosis of microbes. In addition, the complement cleavage products C3d and C3dg (collectively referred to as C3d[g]) enhance adaptive immunity via binding to complement receptor 2 (CR2; also called CD21) on B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), resulting in enhanced antigen-specific antibody production. Expression of CD21 on FDCs promotes retention of opsonized antigens and immune complexes for presentation to B cells, whereas CD21 expression on B cells enables co-clustering with the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and augmented B cell activation through recruitment of the B cell restricted CD19 molecule. For these reasons, C3d(g) possesses potent adjuvant activity [1,2*,3], making its generation a key regulatory step linking innate and adaptive immune responses.

This review focuses on the role of complement C3 cleavage products and their receptors in the induction of antibody responses to foreign and self antigens.

### Generation of C3d(g) and binding to complement receptors

Complement activation is achieved by C1q binding to either bound antibody (classical pathway, Figure 1a) or microbial components (alternative pathway, Figure 1b). Each pathway generates a C3 convertase (C4b2a or C3bBb) for the cleavage of complement C3 into active fragments that function as important chemoattractants (C3a) and bound opsonins (C3b, iC3b, C3d[g]), as well as precursors for the generation of the chemoattractant C5a and the formation of the membrane-attack complex (C5b-9) [4]. Interstitial or serum C3 is also subject to a slow rate of spontaneous cleavage ('tickover'). C3b is converted to iC3b and subsequently C3dg by fluid phase factor I and factor H (Figure 1d). Although C3dg can be further cleaved by serum proteases to generate C3d, both C3d and C3dg appear to have identical biological functions. C3d can also be generated at the B cell surface by binding of C1q to aggregated membrane IgM to initiate the classical pathway (Figure 1c) [5*], or by binding of C3b to complement receptor 1 (CR1; also called CD35) which acts in the same way as factor H (Figure 1d). Thus, membrane proximal generation of C3d(g)-bound antigen can also result in BCR-CD21 co-aggregation.

### Composition and signal transducing properties of the B cell coreceptor complex

The B cell coreceptor complex, which is defined by its ability to bind and respond to C3d(g)-bound antigen, is composed of CD19, CD21 and the widely expressed CD81 and Leu13 proteins. Although murine and human CD21 and CD35 are highly related gene products and share some ligand-binding properties, C3d(g) binding is restricted to CD21 (Figure 1d). CD19, the primary signaling component, augments B cell activation and binds CD81 and CD21, as well as components of the BCR complex [6]. B cells lacking the tetraspanin protein CD81 express reduced levels of surface CD19, which is attributed to impaired post-endoplasmic reticulum trafficking and/or instability on the plasma membrane [7]. CD19, however, is not required for expression of CD21, which is induced relatively late in differentiation as B cells transit from the bone marrow to the periphery. Therefore, the

roles of CD19 and CD81 in early B cell development are independent of CD21, and C3d(g)-dependent coreceptor function is limited to peripheral B cells.

Signal transduction by the BCR and coreceptor complexes is initiated by the recruitment and activation of tyrosine kinases. Upon antigen binding, membrane immunoglobulin and the Igα-Igβ heterodimer translocate to the glycolipid and cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains ('lipid rafts') wherein fatty-acid-modified Src family kinases are constitutively present. Similarly, coengagement of the BCR and CD21 with polymeric C3d(g) bound to antigen promotes CD19-CD21-CD81 partitioning to the rafts, functioning to augment and potentiate signal transduction [8]. CD81 is required for partitioning of the coreceptor complex to the rafts [9], and might do so through inducible palmitoylation [10]. It is noteworthy that CD19 is not associated with the rafts upon BCR crosslinking alone [8], yet clearly exerts important BCR-dependent functions that are also CD21 independent [11,12]. However, CD19 efficiently translocates to the rafts upon engagement of CD21 with polymeric C3d [8], but may not become signaling competent. Correlating the sorting of B cell coreceptor components to biochemically distinct membrane microdomains with specific B cell signaling functions remains a challenging issue.

Coligation of CD19 with the BCR greatly enhances cell cycle entry and cell survival [12,13], an effect that is likely to be enhanced *in vivo* upon corecognition of complement C3d-opsonized antigen by CD21 and the BCR [1]. Although the importance of singular engagement of CD19 or CD21 is not well studied, early work showed

Current Opinion in Immunology 2005, 17:237–243 www.sciencedirect.com
that exposure to polymeric C3d(g) primed B cells for subsequent BCR-induced proliferation [14]. The signal transducing capacity of CD19, especially its phosphotyrosine-based recruitment of SH2-domain-containing proteins, has been extensively studied. However, experiments to address the physiological importance of these interactions have only recently emerged. Wang *et al.* [15] demonstrated that mice expressing a CD19 molecule bearing tandem Tyr→Phe substitutions (Y482F and Y513F) determined the phenotype of CD19⁻/⁻ mice. These residues are important for the recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase), Lyn kinase, and subsequent phosphorylation of other CD19 tyrosines [16–18]. The inositol phosphatase PTEN directly counters PI3 kinase activity by hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P₃). Thus, the presence of CD19 and the absence of PTEN should both lead to sustained PtdIns-3,4,5-P₃ levels in B cells responding to BCR stimulation. The *in vivo* significance of this relationship was established by the demonstration that the B cell specific deletion of *Pten* on the CD19⁻/⁻ background leads to a recovery of CD19-associated B cell differentiation events [19•]. These findings support the hypothesis that the primary signaling function for CD19 is to recruit PI3 kinase.

### B cell coreceptor function in the immune response

C3⁻/⁻ mice exhibit impaired adaptive and innate immune responses due to the pivotal role of C3 in the complement cascade. The majority of complement C3 is produced by the liver, although myeloid cells present in the secondary lymphoid tissues are a sufficient source of C3 for inducing the antibody response [20–22], indicating that local production of C3 is crucial for antigen opsonization. Accordingly, complement activation by immune complexes has been shown to occur within the follicular environment [23•], thus promoting recognition by FDCs. In addition, marginal zone (MZ) B cells that express elevated levels of CD21 are poised to capture C3d(g)-bound antigens and immune complexes arriving from the blood [24,25,26•]. MZ B cells can transport C3d(g)-bound antigen into the follicle for transfer to FDCs, and/or migrate to the red pulp to differentiate into plasma cells [26•,27•,28,29].

Mice deficient in *Cr2* (encoding both CD21 and CD35 as alternatively spliced gene products) respond poorly to T cell dependent (TD) and independent (TI) antigens [25,30,31]. Pleural cavity B-1 cells and splenic MZ B cells are thought to be the major producers of antibody to TI antigens [32]. Although reports differ on whether the B-1 cell compartment is reduced in *Cr2⁻/⁻* mice [25,30,31], some B-1 cell derived antigen specificities associated with natural IgM are clearly lacking [33–35]. The MZ B cell compartment is intact in *Cr2⁻/⁻* mice, although binding of complemented and immune-complexed antigens is compromised [25,36]. Studies of the

early and secondary/memory responses indicate that impaired early responses to low/physiological doses of antigen reflect B cell intrinsic defects in antigen recognition and signaling by the CD19–CD21 coreceptor complex [37]. In addition to this defect, inefficient retention of antigen by *Cr2⁻/⁻* FDCs and impaired survival of germinal center (GC) B cells leads to an impaired memory response [38,39].

The phenotypes of *Cr2⁻/⁻* and CD19⁻/⁻ mice underscore important similarities and differences in CD19 and CD21–CD35 function. CD19 is only expressed on B cells and is an important transmembrane adaptor protein for signaling via the BCR, in addition to CD21. CD19⁻/⁻ mice exhibit striking deficiencies in B-1, MZ and GC B cells [40–42]. The loss of B-1 cells in CD19⁻/⁻ mice has come to represent a common theme in genetically modified mice with impaired BCR signaling. However, augmented BCR signaling can lead to an expanded B-1 cell population, as in the case of mice overexpressing CD19 [43]. Unlike B-1 cells, however, the formation and maintenance of MZ B cells does not appear to be directly determined by the strength of BCR signaling [44]. Thus, mutations that impair B-1 cell formation often, but not always, coincide with defects in the formation of the MZ B cell compartment.

The striking defect in GC B cell differentiation in CD19⁻/⁻ mice is likely to be indicative of a failure to recognize and respond to TD protein antigens. By comparison, complement C3⁻/⁻ and *Cr2⁻/⁻* mice also exhibit phenotypes of reduced TD responses and GC formation [45], leading to the hypothesis that CD21 promotes co-recognition of C3d(g)-bearing antigen and acts through CD19 in concert with the BCR complex to propagate intracellular signaling. Enhanced recruitment of CD19 to the BCR by CD21 coengagement may promote B cell activation by otherwise nonmitogenic TD antigens. In addition, CD21 binding enables the uptake and presentation of C3d(g)-tagged antigens to CD4⁺ T cells [46,47]. Recent studies have shown that coengagement with the BCR enhances this process, and thus confers some degree of antigen specificity [48,49]. CD21-mediated antigen internalization and presentation requires Igα, Igβ and the cytoplasmic tail of CD21 [48], but it is unclear whether it requires CD19. In summary, it appears that CD19 and CD21 are crucial for both initial B cell activation by TD antigens, recruitment of T cell help and subsequent maturation in the GC to form the memory B-cell compartment.

### Complement and complement receptors in autoimmune disease

complement is a critical inducer and effector of inflammation, it is thought that the failed clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells may increase the likelihood of exposure and reactivity to autoantigens [54]. By contrast, C3 deficiency does not appear to break tolerance or promote susceptibility to autoimmune disease [50,54]. Moreover, as self and foreign antigens are both capable of being opsonized, C3 activation might actually promote autoimmunity in some contexts. For example, in the classical mouse model of type II collagen (CII)-induced inflammatory arthritis (CIA), C3 is required to promote joint inflammation and autodestruction [55]. We found that transient depletion of C3 at the time of CII immunization or inactivation of the Cr2 locus protected mice from developing arthritis (CJ Del Nagro *et al.*, personal communication). These findings implicated C3d(g) in the inductive phase of the disease. To test this hypothesis directly, we immunized mice with CII coupled to C3d and found that C3d fixation was sufficient to induce arthritis in the absence of the pro-inflammatory mycobacterial component of complete Freund's adjuvant. Thus, although C3d(g) production is central to bridging innate and adaptive immunity, its adjuvant activity can be misdirected to promote autoimmunity.

In addition to peripheral tolerance, the roles of C3, CD21 and CD35 have also been examined in central tolerance [50]. CD21 and CD35 are gradually upregulated on newly formed B cells as they emigrate from the bone marrow and transit to the spleen. Therefore, self antigens that have been opsonized by C3d(g) have the potential to modulate B cell selection by engaging CD21. Cr2^−/−^ B cells might be less susceptible to negative selection as they do not downregulate surface IgM or become anergic in the presence of the neo-self antigen hen egg lysozyme (HEL) [50]. In relation to this, a single nucleotide polymorphism that causes impaired CD21 aggregation and C3d(g) binding might contribute to the lupus-like syndrome observed in the NZM 2410 mouse strain [53]. However, B cells in mice overexpressing human CD19 (hCD19) are poorly tolerated and produce anti-HEL autoantibodies [43]. To explain these interesting yet puzzling findings, we suggest a novel role for CD21 in sequestering CD19 from the BCR at the transitional stage of B cell development when B cells are becoming less sensitive to tolerogenic signals (*Figure* 2a). This action would attenuate CD19-dependent signaling as the cells transit to the periphery. In the absence of CD21 or the overexpression of hCD19, which does not associate efficiently with mouse CD21 [11], tolerance is breached by the delivery of CD19-dependent signals induced by the BCR (*Figure* 2b,c). One prediction of such a model is that the induced recruitment of additional CD19 to the BCR

complex upon antigen corecognition by the BCR and CD21 might break tolerance (*Figure* 2d). Support for the role of CD21 in titrating BCR signaling was recently provided by Chakravarty *et al.* [56] who showed that CD21 aggregation reduced BCR-associated Lyn kinase. As immature B cells exhibit increased sensitivity to antigen, which correlates with increased sensitivity to negative selection [57], increased aggregation of CD19 with the BCR complex may qualitatively alter rather than quantitatively augment BCR signaling at this stage.

### Conclusions

In recent years, foundational work on the relationship of complement C3, CD19, CD21 and CD35 has resulted in a growing appreciation of the importance of complement for the induction and recall of antibody responses to foreign antigens. Future challenges include understanding how complement and complement receptors contribute to the prevention or, conversely, exacerbation of autoimmunity in particular contexts. In addition, the molecular interplay of the BCR, CD19, CD21 and CD35 remains to be fully resolved. The attractive paradigm that CD21 signals exclusively through CD19 remains to be experimentally validated in the case of B cell activation as well as antigen uptake and presentation. A better understanding of complement function and the antibody response holds great promise for the development of complement (e.g. C3d)-based vaccines as well as modalities for the treatment of B cell-dependent autoimmune disease.

Free journals for developing countries

The WHO and six medical journal publishers have launched the Access to Research Initiative, which enables nearly 70 of the world's poorest countries to gain free access to biomedical literature through the Internet.

The science publishers, Blackwell, Elsevier, the Harcourt Worldwide STM group, Wolters Kluwer International Health and Science, Springer-Verlag and John Wiley, were approached by the WHO and the British Medical Journal in 2001. Initially, more than 1000 journals will be available for free or at significantly reduced prices to universities, medical schools, research and public institutions in developing countries. The second stage involves extending this initiative to institutions in other countries.

Gro Harlem Brundtland, director-general for the WHO, said that this initiative was 'perhaps the biggest step ever taken towards reducing the health information gap between rich and poor countries'.
