**Abstract** Soybean hairy roots, transformed with the soybean chalcone synthase (*CHS6*) or isoflavone synthase (*IFS2*) genes, with dramatically decreased capacity to synthesize isoflavones were produced to determine what effects these changes would have on susceptibility to a fungal pathogen. The isoflavone and coumestrol concentrations were decreased by about 90% in most lines apparently due to gene silencing. The *IFS2* transformed lines had very low IFS enzyme activity in microsomal fractions as measured by the conversion of naringenin to genistein. The *CHS6* lines with decreased isoflavone concentrations had 5 to 20-fold lower CHS enzyme activities than the appropriate controls. Both *IFS2* and *CHS* transformed lines accumulated higher concentrations of both soluble and cell wall bound phenolic acids compared to controls with higher levels found in the *CHS6* lines indicating alterations in the lignin biosynthetic branch of the pathway. Induction of the soybean phytoalexin glyceollin, of which the precursor is the isoflavone daidzein, by the fungal pathogen *Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines* (FSG) that causes soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS) showed that the low isoflavone transformed lines did not accumulate glyceollin while the control lines did. The (iso)liquiritigenin content increased upon FSG induction in the *IFS2* transformed roots indicating that the pathway reactions before this point can control isoflavonoid synthesis. The lowest fungal growth rate on hairy roots was found on the FSG partially resistant control roots followed by the SDS sensitive control roots and the low isoflavone transformants. The results indicate the importance of phytoalexin synthesis in root resistance to the pathogen.

**Introduction**

The production of phytoalexins, low molecular weight antimicrobial compounds, is considered to be a very important mechanism that can be triggered in plant
cells upon invasion by various pathogenic microbes (Paxton and Groth 1994; Kuc 1995). Phenylpropanoids serve as pathogen inducible phytoalexins in many plant species including the legumes (Keen 1972; Dakora and Phillips 1996; Dixon 2001; Lozovaya et al. 2004a, b). However, direct evidence for the ‘phytoalexin hypothesis’ is lacking (Dixon and Steele 1999; Hammerschmidt 1999; Shadle et al. 2003).

Glyceollin is a pterocarpan phytoalexin produced de novo in various tissues of soybean plants after pathogenic infection and was among the first phytoalexins studied in detail (Paxton 1974). The accumulation of glyceollin has been implicated in providing soybean resistance against *Phytophthora sojae* [Kauf and Gerde] (Ayers et al. 1976; Albersheim and Valent 1978; Zahringer et al. 1978; Bhattacharyya and Ward 1985; Ebel and Grisebach 1988; Graham and Graham 1991; Morris et al. 1998). We have shown that the ability of soybean roots to rapidly produce sufficient amounts of glyceollin in response to the soil-borne fungal pathogen *Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines* (FSG) infection appears to be important in providing partial resistance to this fungus (Lozovaya et al. 2004a, b). This conclusion was reached since the glyceollin content was higher in FSG-inoculated plant roots or hairy roots of a partially resistant genotype PI567.374 than in a susceptible genotype Spencer even though the glyceollin precursor, the isoflavone daidzein, was higher in Spencer. We also showed that FSG mycelia grew more slowly on inoculated PI567.374 hairy roots than on Spencer hairy roots indicating that hairy roots can be used to measure resistance to FSG, the fungus that causes the soybean disease sudden death syndrome.

Genetic engineering tools have opened up new possibilities for studying the role of phytoalexins in plant defense. The reduction of phytoalexin accumulation in cultured root tissues was recently reported via genetic manipulations that resulted in enhanced susceptibility to fungal pathogens (Wu and VanEtten 2004; Subramanian et al. 2005). Pea hairy roots expressing the gene encoding the enzyme (+)6a-hydroxymaackiain 3-O-methyltransferase (HMM) responsible for the final reaction of phytoalexin pisatin synthesis produced less pisatin compared to the control and were more susceptible to fungal infection (Wu and VanEtten 2004). RNA interference was used to induce the silencing of isoflavone synthase genes in soybean-cultured tissues, which led to less resistance to *P. sojae* (Subramanian et al. 2005). We have prevented the synthesis of isoflavone precursor(s) of soybean phytoalexin glyceollin (and as a consequence of phytoalexins) via homology-dependent gene silencing in hairy root cultures. Such genetically modified tissues that are incapable of phytoalexin

production can help to study the role of phytoalexins in plant disease resistance. Here we report the effect of the blockage of isoflavone synthesis by constitutive expression of two key genes in the isoflavonoid pathway (Fig. 1), chalcone synthase and isoflavone synthase, that leads to the inability to synthesize glyceollin in soybean hairy roots on root resistance to FSG. We also describe changes in other branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway resulted from root genetic modification.

## Materials and methods

### Induction of hairy roots

Hairy roots were induced from two soybean genotypes with different sensitivities to FSG (Spencer, susceptible and PI 563.374 partially resistant to this fungus) according to Savka et al. (1990) with some modifications of Cho et al. (2000). Soybean seeds were sterilized in diluted commercial bleach (0.9% sodium hypochlorite), washed several times in sterile water and germinated on 1% agar and 1% sucrose medium for 3–4 days. Cotyledons were wounded on the abaxial side with a scalpel blades dipped in a culture of *A. rhizogenes* (strain K599, a gift from Dr. Stephen Farrand, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL), transformed with either empty vector pILTAB-357 to generate control roots, or with these vectors carrying the *CHS6* or *IFS2* genes. After 3 days of co-cultivation the cotyledons were transferred to solid MXB medium with MS (Murashige et al. 1962) basal salts, B5 (Gamborg et al. 1968) vitamins and 2% v/v sucrose, pH 5.7) solidified with 2 gl−1 gelrite (Greif Bros. Corp., Sportswood, NJ, USA) containing 500 mg l−1 carbenicillin to inhibit bacterial growth and 100 mg l−1 kanamycin for selection. Two weeks after root emergence about 2 cm long root segments were transferred to fresh medium to establish individual root clones. Transformed *A. rhizogenes*-free roots were obtained by three or four passages of 2 weeks each on the antibiotic medium at 24°C in the dark. Established root cultures were maintained on MXB medium.

### Vector construction and *A. rhizogenes* transformation

To prepare the chimeric cassava vein mosaic virus (CsVMV) promoter/soybean *CHS6* or *IFS2* gene constructs, we used vector pILTAB-357 (from The Scripps Research Institute, Division of Plant Biology, LaJolla, CA, USA), which contained the CsVMV promoter (Verdaguer et al. 1996), *nos* terminator and *NPT-II* gene (neomycin phosphotransferase) as a selectable marker (Fig. 2).

Dr. L. Vodkin (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, accession # L03352) kindly provided the soybean CHS6 cDNA. A 1.8 kB DNA fragment was amplified by PCR (the 5' primer used—TCA CGC GGA TCC ATG GTG AGT GGT GAA GAG ATT and the 3' primer—AGT GCG GGA TCC TTA GAC TGT GAC ACT GCG AAG) and then was ligated using the BamHI restriction site into vector pILTAB-357.

The soybean IFS2 cDNA accession # AF135484 (a gift from The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Ardmore, OK) was used for amplification of a 1.56 kB DNA fragment (the PCR 5' primer used—5'TCA CGC GGA TCC TTG CTT GAA CTT GCA CTT and the 3' primer—AGT GCC GGA TCC TTA AGA AAG GAG TTT AGA TGC). The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI site of pILTAB-357.

The electroporation method (Cho et al. 2000) was used for the *A. rhizogenes* (K599) transformation with the plasmids.

DNA and RNA extraction and analysis

Genomic DNA for PCR screening of the hairy root was extracted from lyophilized material (Dellaporta 1994). The 5'PCR primer was designed as specific for the CsVMV promoter: 5'AGG ATA CAA CTT CAG AGA and the 3' primers were the same as ones used for the CHS6 or IFS2 gene cloning. Genomic DNA for Southern blot hybridization was extracted from lyophilized hairy roots using "Nucleon Phyto Pure, Plant and Fungal DNA Extraction Kit" (Amersham Biosciences, UK). Genomic DNA of 15 μg of was digested with

BamHI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) enzyme, which released the full-length gene from the plasmid. Digested DNA was run in a 0.8% agarose gel and then blotted on Hybond XL membrane (Amersham) for 24 h. 1.8 kB of CHS6, 1.56 kB of IFS2 and 980 bp of NptII were digested from plasmids with BamHI, purified and labeled with dCT[^32^P] with “Megaprime DNA labeling system” (Amersham) and used as probes. The membranes were prehybridized in 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt’s solution, 0.5% SDS and 20 μg ml⁻¹ denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65°C for 1 h, and subsequently incubated overnight with labeled probe. The membranes were washed using standard protocol and were exposed to radiographic film at –70°C from 1 to 2 days.

Total RNA extraction was done from roots frozen in liquid nitrogen with “RNAesy Plant Mini Kit” (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). DNase treatment of RNA samples was done with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following the kit instructions. Aliquots from the reaction were taken for PCR with Taq polymerase to check DNA contamination. The DNase reaction mixture of 10% was used in RT-PCR with SuperScript III RNase H⁻ Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the kit protocol. Primers for the cDNA synthesis were specific for each gene. The 5′ primer was specific for the CsVMV promoter as described above and the 3′ primer for the CHS6 gene was: GCG CTT GAA CTT TTC TTT to amplify 200 bp of this gene and the 3′ primer for the IFS2 gene was TCG ATC CTC TTC TCA TAC TTT CCA ACC TTG AGA for amplification of a 700 bp gene fragment.

Extraction and analysis of phenolic compounds

Soybean hairy root samples (0.4 g fresh weight) were ground in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle and extracted with 5 vol of 80% methanol (v/v) at 20°C with vigorous shaking for 12 h. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min was filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane and a portion was used for HPLC analysis of isoflavones and a portion for analysis of phenolic acids. The pellet obtained after centrifugation was washed twice with chloroform-methanol (1:1; v/v) followed by 100% methanol, and the alcohol-insoluble residue (AIR) was dried at 65°C and used for analysis of cell wall-bound phenolics.

Isoflavone separation was achieved with a Waters 2690 Separation Module (Waters Corp, Milford, MA, USA) using a 53 × 7 mm EPS C₁₈ Alltech Rocket Column (Alltech Assoc, Deerfield, IL, USA) following a previously reported method (Graham 1991) with some modifications (Lozovaya et al. 2004b). A linear gradient composed of water (pH 2.8 by acetic acid) and acetonitrile was used. Following injection of 20–50 μl of sample, acetonitrile was increased from 0 to 12% v/v over 6 min and then increased to 95% over 26 min. The solvent flow was 2.5 ml min⁻¹. A Waters 996 photodiode array detector was used.

An aliquot (0.5 ml) of the total phenolic extract was evaporated on a rotary evaporator to dryness and 2 ml of 4 N HCl was added. Conjugated phenolic acids were hydrolyzed at 95°C for 1 h and the free phenolic acids were extracted by ether that was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and redissolved in 100 μl methanol for HPLC analysis under the same conditions as the isoflavones except that following sample injection, acetonitrile was increased from 0 to 12% v/v over 14 min and then increased to 95% over 12 min.

Some samples were hydrolyzed with β-glucosidase from almond in acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 37°C for 2 h (Hsieh and Graham 2001). Phenolic compounds were extracted with ethyl acetate; samples were evaporated to dryness, redissolved in 80% methanol and analyzed by HPLC as described above.

Identification of isoflavones, phytoalexin glyceollin and phenolic acids and aldehydes was carried out by comparison of retention times and UV spectra (PDA detector, Waters Corp.) of the eluting peaks and authentic standard compounds as previously described (Lozovaya et al. 2004b). Daidzein, genistein, glycitein and their 7-O-glucosides daidzin, genistin, glycitin and 6″-O-malonyl-7-O-glucoside genistein were purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA, USA). Coumestrol was purchased from Fluka Chemical Corp. (Milwaukee, WI, USA), p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, syringic, coumaric acids, and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin and syringaldehyde were purchased from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO, USA). The glyceollin standard was a kind gift of Dr. Gijzen (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Ontario, Canada). 6″-O-malonyl-7-O-glucosides of daidzein, genistein and glycitein were identified by UV spectra and also according to their ability to convert to 7-O-glucosides after heating in methanol as described before (Lozovaya et al. 2004b). Isoflavones and glyceollin were monitored at A₂₈₀ and coumestrol was monitored at A₃₄₃ and phenolic acids and aldehydes were monitored at 295 nm. Phenolics were quantified as individual peak area units (converted to μg) based on the appropriate integration response factors. Glyceollin concentrations were determined as the total peak of all glyceollin isomers. Quantification of malonyl forms of isoflavonoids was based on response factors

of corresponding 7- O -glucosides corrected for the
molecular mass differences. The calculated response
factor of 6′′- O -malonyl-7- O -glucoside genistein was
within 7% that of standard 6′′- O -malonyl-7- O -gluco-
side genistein purchased from LC Lab. Examples of
typical HPLC chromatograms of hairy root methanol
extracts were presented in our previous report (Loz-
ovaya et al. 2004b). Peak identity for isoflavones stud-
ied was confirmed by LC–MS. Mass spectra of phenolic
compounds were scanned with a Finigan LCQ Deca
XP ion-trap mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA, USA)
equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) source,
coupled with HPLC and controlled by Xcalibur soft-
ware. The spray needle voltage was 3.5 kV in the posi-
tive mode and -4.5 kV in the negative mode; capillary
voltage was 40 V in the positive mode and –40 V in the
negative mode; capillary temperature was 250°C. The
ion collision energy in MS/MS was 35%.

The structure of new phenolic compounds was
determined using LC/MS/MS with electrospray ioniza-
tion (ESI) and UV spectra obtained with the PDA
detector. HPLC conditions were as follows: column
Prevail C18, 250 × 46 mm, 5 μm particle size. A linear
gradient composed of water (with 0.1% formic acid
and 5% acetonitrile) and acetonitrile (with 0.1% for-
mic acid and 5% water) was used. Following the injec-
tion of 20 μl of sample, acetonitrile was increased from
0 to 30% v/v over 35 min and then increased to 90%
over 57 min. Flow rate was 1 ml min−1.

Analysis of the hairy root cell wall phenolics

Ester-bound cell wall phenolics

Ester-bound cell wall phenolics were analyzed accord-
ing to Lozovaya et al. (1999) with slight modification.
Samples of dried AIR (15–20 mg) were treated with
1 mL 1N NaOH at room temperature for 12 h and
then centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 g. The supernatant
was carefully collected; the pellet was washed with
0.5 ml 1N NaOH and centrifuged again. The second
supernatant was combined with the first and acidified
with concentrated HCl to pH 2.0. Phenolic compounds
were extracted with ether, dried under nitrogen, redis-
solved in methanol, and analyzed with HPLC under
the same conditions as described above for phenolic
acids analysis.

Nitrobenzene oxidation of cell walls

Pellets after cell wall extraction by 1N NaOH were
carefully transferred to 4 ml vials and 2 ml 2N NaOH
and 250 μl nitrobenzene were added to each glass vial
and sealed with PTFE caps. Vials were heated at 170°C
for 3 h and the cooled reaction mixture was extracted 3
times with ether and the residue was acidified with con-
centrated HCl to pH 2.0.

Phenolic acids and aldehydes were extracted and
analyzed as described for ester-bound phenolics.

Preparation of microsomal fraction and isoflavone
synthase activity assay

Microsomal fractions were prepared according to Liu
and Dixon (2001). Soybean hairy roots (3–4 g fresh
weight) were homogenized in 5 ml of buffer A (0.1 M
potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.4 M sucrose, 14 mM 2-
mercaptoethanol) with 1% (w/w PVPP and 0.3 g of
Dowex 1 × 2 per gram of roots). The homogenate was
centrifuged at 2,300g for 15 min at 4°C, and the super-
natant was filtered through Miracloth and centrifuged
at 135,000g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was
decanted and the pellet washed carefully two times
with buffer B (80 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0,
20% sucrose w/v, 0.5 mM glutathione). The pellet was
resuspended in 400 μl of buffer B and used for enzyme
assay.

The isoflavone synthase assay was carried out
according to Jung et al. (2000). Microsomal fractions
(30–50 μg protein) in buffer B (100 μl of a final reaction
volume) were incubated for 60 min at 15°C with
100 μM naringenin and 0.4 mM NADPH as substrates
(Sigma). The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl
acetate and the ethyl acetate was evaporated under
nitrogen and the residue was dissolved in 40 μl metha-
nol and analyzed by HPLC under the same conditions
as used for isoflavone analysis to measure the genistein
formed (Fig. 1).

Chalcone synthase activity assay

Chalcone synthase activity was measured according to
Zuurbier (1993). Hairy roots were ground in the pres-
ence of liquid nitrogen, sand and 10% (w/w) PVPP.
The frozen powder was mixed with 4 vol of the extrac-
tion buffer (0.1 MK-Pi buffer, pH 6.8, 1.4 mM mercap-
toethanol, 3 mM EDTA, 40 mM sodium ascorbate,
10 μM leupeptin, 0.2 mM phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluo-
ride; solution flushed with N₂ gas before use). The mix-
ture after thawing was filtered through miracloth,
centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 g, and the protein was
precipitated from the supernatant with (NH₄)₂SO₄
between 30–70% saturation range. The pellet was dis-
solved in 2.5 ml desalting buffer (0.1 MK-Pi buffer, pH
6.8, 1.4 mM mercaptoethanol, 40 mM sodium ascor-
bate, 5% trehalose; flushed with gaseous nitrogen
before use) and applied to a PD10 desalting column (Sephadex G-25M, Pharmacia) following the manufacturer's protocols.

The protein extract, 100 μl (90–120 μg of protein), was added to 300 μl assay buffer (0.5 M K-Pi, pH 6.8, 2.8 mM mercaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) and the reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl 0.2 mM malonyl-CoA (2 nmol) (Sigma, MO, USA) and 10 μl 0.14 mM *p*-coumaroyl-CoA (1.4 nmol). The *p*-coumaroyl-CoA was synthesized and purified according to Edwards and Kessmann (1992). After incubation (30 min at 30°C) the reaction mixtures were extracted twice with 300 μl ethyl acetate, the combined extracts were evaporated under a N₂ steam, the residue was dissolved in 50 μl methanol and the concentration of the naringenin was determined by HPLC [Prevail C₁₈, Altech (Alltech Assoc., Deerfield, IL) 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, and Waters 996 PDA detector were used]. HPLC conditions applied were: a linear gradient of water (pH 2.8 by acetic acid) and acetonitrile with flow rate 1 ml/min. Following injection of the sample (30 μl), the acetonitrile was increased from 15 to 40% over 30 min and then increased from 40 to 95% over 46 min.

**Hairy root inoculation with FSG**

Established hairy root cultures were treated either with FSG macroconidial spore suspensions (sprayed at 10³ ml⁻¹) for 48 h or with mycelial plugs (placed above the roots at the center of plates) for 72 h, and incubated at 25°C (Lozovaya et al. 2004b). Macroconidial spore suspensions were prepared from a 2-week-old culture of the FSG (isolate Mont-1) with sterile distilled water and the concentration was determined using a hemocytometer. A mycelial plug, 4 mm diameter, from the margin of 2-week-old cultures of the FSG isolate Mont-1 was placed mycelial side down directly on top of the hairy roots as described below. In our previous experiments (Lozovaya et al. 2004b) we found that measurable accumulation of glyceollin occurred 24 h after hairy root inoculation with FSG macroconidial spore suspensions, when the fungus just started visibly growing on roots and the infection did spread over roots by 96 h after treatment.

For measurement of the fungicidal properties of flavonoids, a mycelial plug as described above was placed in the center of a 10 cm diameter Petri dish with PDA (potato dextrose agar) medium (3.9% w/v) containing each compound. Compounds were added to the medium before solidification in 100% ethanol to give a final concentration of 75 μM. The concentration of ethanol in each medium was 1% (v/v) including the

control without flavonoids. The measurements of colony diameters were made after 6 days of growth at room temperature.

**Test for hairy root resistance to FSG infection**

The middle section of the solid medium (approximately 35 mm wide) was cut out from a 10 cm diameter Petri dish from edge to edge and three or four segments of hairy roots (2 weeks after subculture) were placed on the Petri dish so that both ends of roots were on the solid medium but the central part was not in contact with the medium. The mycelium plugs (about 1.5 mm diameter) were placed on the middle of the hairy root segments 1 day later. The FGS mycelium growth (total length in mm) was measured under a microscope 3 days after inoculation.

**Data analysis**

Results of HPLC or enzyme analyses presented in tables and figures are mean values of three independent sample replicates ± SE and there were 2–4 HPLC or enzyme analyses done for each replicated sample. Two fungal growth experiments with 18 replicates for each line were carried out.

One-way ANOVA (*P* = 0.05) was used to assess the statistical significance of differences between samples using the algorithm incorporated into Microsoft Excel 2002 (Microsoft Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA). Differences were determined to be statistically significant at *P* < 0.05.

**Results**

**Manipulation of isoflavone synthesis via genetic engineering**

Hairy root cultures were generated by transformation with *Agrobacterium rhizogenes* of two soybean genotypes with different susceptibilities (susceptible ‘Spencer’ and partially resistant ‘PI567.374’) to the soil-borne fungal pathogen *Fusarium solani* f. sp. *glycines* (FSG) that causes sudden death syndrome. The soybean isoflavone synthase gene (*IFS2*) or chalcone synthase (*CHS6*) gene in sense orientation driven by the constitutive CsVMV promoter was used for transformation (Fig. 2). The presence of the inserted *CHS6* or *IFS2* genes was confirmed by PCR using the 5′PCR primer specific for the CsVMV promoter and a 3′PCR primer specific for the respective gene (data not shown). A total of 19 lines transformed with the *IFS2*
gene and 17 lines transformed with the *CHS6* gene were analyzed for the principal isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, glycitein and their glycosides: genistin, daidzin, glycitin and their malonylated conjugates: malonyl genistin, malonyl daidzin, and malonyl glycitin) and also the isoflavonoid phytoalexins (coumestrol and glyceollin). Glyceollin is not normally present in uninduced hairy roots. The total isoflavone and coumestrol concentrations were lower in most of the lines than in the controls (transformed with an empty plasmid) and were less than 10% of that of the appropriate controls of both genotypes in several lines (Fig. 3a, b). While some of the transformed lines had concentrations of isoflavonoids similar to the controls, none had higher concentrations. The hairy roots of all lines that were transformed with *IFS2* that accumulated very low concentrations of isoflavonoids were bright yellow in color, unlike the control lines and other transformed hairy root lines.

The hairy root lines that contained very low concentrations of isoflavones of PI, lines 54 (*CHS6*) and 34 (*IFS2*), and Spencer, lines 104 (*CHS6*) and 121 (*IFS2*), and the control lines (16, PI and 78, Spencer) were chosen for further experimentation. The presence of the transgenes in selected lines was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization (Fig. 4a–c). *BamHI* digestion cuts

out the 1.56 kB *IFS2* gene and the 1.8 kB *CHS6* gene. Line 34 had at least two copies of the *IFS2* transgene and the other three lines had more than two copies of their respective transgenes (Fig. 4c). Since the inserted genes are from soybean the Southern hybridizations show bands representing the endogenous genes and extra bands representing the transgenes are also present. Using a combination of reverse transcriptase and PCR (RT-PCR) we also demonstrated that the *CHS6* or *IFS2* genes are being expressed only in these selected hairy root lines and not in control hairy root lines (Fig. 5). The growth rate and morphology of the selected hairy root lines transformed with *IFS2* or *CHS6* genes did not differ from the respective PI controls except the Spencer line104 transformed with the *CHS6* gene did grow about two-fold faster in two independent experiments.

Metabolic characteristics of transformed hairy roots

The IFS activity of microsomal fractions prepared from control and *IFS2* transformed hairy roots of both genotypes was measured as the capacity to convert naringenin to genistein. Even though there is abundant IFS mRNA present (Fig. 5), the IFS activity was almost undetectable in the microsomal fractions of *IFS2* transformed roots while the control accumulated genistein to much higher levels (Fig. 6). When CHS activity was measured in the *CHS6* transformed hairy root lines with low isoflavone contents, about a 20-fold decrease was found in the PI transformed line 54 and about a

Compound I (R<sub>t</sub> 19.2 min, λ<sub>max</sub> = 271; 313.5) gave a low intensity pseudomolecular ion [M + H]<sup>+</sup> of m/z 598 and ions of 419 and 257. MS–MS of the most intensive peak at m/z 419 [M + H -hexose]<sup>+</sup> gave an ion at m/z 257 corresponding to the loss of the second hexose residue from pseudomolecular ion [M + H –2 hexose]<sup>+</sup>. The results obtained allow one to characterize this compound as liquiritigenin diglycoside.

Compound II (R<sub>t</sub> 26.80 min; λ<sub>max</sub> = 271, 313 nm) gave a pseudomolecular ion [M + H]<sup>+</sup> of m/z 419 and MS–MS in the positive mode produced an ion at m/z 257 and the compound was assigned the structure liquiritigenin glycoside.

Compound III (R<sub>t</sub> 27.2 min; λ<sub>max</sub> = 338.5 nm) gave a pseudomolecular ion [M + H]<sup>+</sup> at m/z 435 and MS–MS produced daughter ion at m/z 273 corresponding to the loss of the hexose moiety [M + H -hexose]<sup>+</sup>. Thus the compound was assigned the structure tetrahydroxy-chalcone glycoside.

Compound IV (R<sub>t</sub> 28.0 min; λ<sub>max</sub> = 282 nm) gave a pseudomolecular ion [M + H]<sup>+</sup> at m/z 435 and MS–MS produced daughter ions at m/z 273, 153, and 147. Thus UV spectra characteristics and the presence of ions at m/z 153 and 147 indicate that the compound is naringenin glycoside.

Compound V (R<sub>t</sub> 37.0 min; λ<sub>max</sub> = 225, 361.4 nm) gave a pseudomolecular ion at m/z 419 and MS–MS produced daughter ion at m/z 257 after the loss of the hexose moiety. Compound VI (R<sub>t</sub> 37.8 min; λ<sub>max</sub> = 241, 295, 371.6 nm) gave the same ions at m/z 419 with MS–MS daughter ion at m/z 257. Their UV spectra were characteristic for chalcones and had very slight

differences (Harborne 1964). Both compounds have the hexose residue and apparently are the derivatives of isoliquiritigenin (4,4′,6′-tryhydroxychalcone). We assume that both compounds are the glycosides of isoliquiritigenin but hexose moiety substituted different hydroxyl groups. It is known that substitution of a hydroxyl group in the A ring (in 4′ position) has a smaller effect on the spectrum than substitution in the B ring (in 4-position) (Harborne 1964). The peak on the chromatogram corresponding to compound V (λ_max = 361.4 nm) showed considerably more bathochromatic shift than the peak of compound VI (λ_max = 371.6 nm) compared with isoliquiritigenin aglycone (λ_max = 372 nm), thus compound V was assigned the structure isoliquiritigenin -4-glycoside and compound VI-isoliquiritigenin -4′-glucoside. After the treatment of extracts with almond glucosidase only isoliquiritigenin was detected on the chromatograms indicating that both compounds are the glycosyl conjugates of isoliquiritigenin.

Compound VII (R_t 39.3 min; λ_max = 275.6, 311 nm) gave a pseudomolecular ion [M + H]^+ at m/z 257. Existence of ions of m/z 147 and 137 in the MS–MS spectrum and the retention time and UV spectrum identical to that of commercial liquiritigenin indicate that this compound is liquiritigenin aglycone.

Compound VIII (R_t 46.7 min; λ_max = 241, 372 nm) gave a pseudomolecular ion at m/z 257 and had a retention time and UV spectrum identical to the commercial standard of isoliquiritigenin aglycone.

Several phenolic compounds that were absent in control hairy roots were detected and identified in roots transformed with the CHS6 gene (line 54) (Fig. 8, IX–XII).

Compound IX (R_t 11.0 min, λ_max = 307.6 nm) gave ions of m/z 506, 489, 327, 165, and 147. According to the nitrogen rule (McLafferty and Turecek 1993) an even molecular mass of pseudomolecular ion (506) when ESI is being used indicates that the compound contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. The ion at m/z 489 corresponds to the loss of NH_3 from the pseudomolecular ion. The ion 327 corresponds to the loss of an amino group and hexose [M + H–NH_3 –hexose]. The loss of a second hexose moiety produced the coumarate ion with a mass of 165. Based on MS and UV spectra the compound IX was assigned the structure coumaroyl-glycoside–aminoglycoside.

Compound X (R_t 15.26 min, λ_max = 295.7 nm) gave ions of m/z 344, 325, 165, and 147. The loss of an amino group from the pseudomolecular ion gave an ion with a mass of 325 [M + H–NH_3]^+ and the loss of a hexose moiety gave coumarate as described above. The structure of this compound thus corresponds to coumaroyl-aminoglycoside. The detected difference in UV absorption between compounds IX and X could probably indicate that hexose is bound to coumarate via the 4-OH group of the benzyl ring in compound X and via the carboxyl group in compound IX.

Compound XI (R_t 15.9 min, λ_max = 308.8 nm) gave a pseudomolecular ion at m/z 279 and MS–MS produced ions of 262 [M + H–NH_3] and 147 [M + H–asparagine]^+. The presence of the ion with an even molecular mass after the loss of the amino group indicates that compound XI has two nitrogen atoms and the structure is coumaroyl asparagine.

Compound XII (R_t 19.1 min, λ_max = 308.8 nm) gave a pseudomolecular ion at m/z 280 [M + H]^+ in the positive mode and ion 278 [M–H]^− in the negative mode

indicating that this compound should contain an odd number of nitrogen atoms. MS-MS in the positive mode produced ions at *m/z* 262, 236, 221, 165, and 147. MS-MS in the negative mode produced ions at *m/z* 260, 234, 216, 163, 145, 132. The presence of ions 165 and 147 in the positive mode (163 and 145 in the negative mode) allows one to identify this compound as a derivative of coumaric acid. Based on the molecular mass we assume that the compound is an ester conjugate of coumaric acid and aspartate, coumaroyl-O-4-aspartate.

To determine the concentration of phenolic compounds in selected hairy root lines we hydrolyzed the methanol soluble fraction with 2N HCl or β-glycosidase from almond and analyzed this by HPLC.

Concentrations of daidzein, the predominant isoflavonoid in soybean root and hairy root tissues (Lozovaya et al. 2004a, b), decreased dramatically in the IFS2 transformed hairy roots and genistein was also barely detectable (Fig. 9a). These results indicate that the low IFS enzyme activity is responsible for the block in isoflavonoid biosynthesis (Fig. 1). As one would expect, daidzein precursors, liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin, were found in hairy roots that accumulated low daidzein as well as total isoflavonoid levels as a result of transformation with the IFS2 gene that led to the dramatic decrease of IFS activity (Figs. 1, 6, 9a). Some increases in concentrations of soluble phenolic acids produced by another branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway (Fig. 1) were also found in these lines with blocked isoflavonoid synthesis (Fig. 9b). The alterations in (iso)flavonoids and soluble phenolic acids concentrations were similar in both PI and Spencer transformed hairy roots in comparison with the corresponding controls.

When the isoflavone concentrations were reduced due to genetic modification using the CHS6 gene resulting in reduced CHS activity, isoflavonoid precursors did not accumulate, but the soluble phenolic acid concentrations increased markedly (Fig. 9a, b) in comparison with the control and the lines transformed with the IFS2 gene. The largest increase (compared to control roots) occurred in *p*-hydroxybenzoic acid in roots transformed with IFS2 and in coumaric acid in roots transformed with CHS6.

Interestingly, changes were also found in the composition of hydroxycinnamic acids bound to the cell walls via ester bonds that were released by 1N alkali treatment (Fig. 10a). Several-fold increases in *p*-hydroxybenzoic acid and *p*-hydroxybenzoic aldehyde were found in the IFS2 transformed roots and there was a dramatic increase in coumaric acid concentrations in the CHS6 transformed roots. These changes led not

only to increased levels of total phenolic acids in the cell walls of transformed roots but also to very different compositions of esterified phenolics with H-unit derivatives being predominant in comparison with the control where S-units predominate. An increase in the proportion and concentration of H-units was also found in the monomeric composition of lignin when phenolic products of nitrobenzene oxidation of the transformed hairy roots cell wall residue obtained after alkali treatment were analyzed (Fig. 10b).

Metabolic response to FSG infection

Control hairy roots that were not transformed with IFS2 or CHS6 genes accumulated the phytoalexin glyceollin in response to FSG infection with macroconidial spore suspensions (Table 1). Glyceollin was not detected in non-inoculated roots as was previously found in our studies with intact plant roots and hairy roots (Lozovaya et al. 2004a, b). The glyceollin concentrations were higher in both the infected root tissues and the culture medium of the partially resistant PI than for the susceptible Spencer hairy roots. However, glyceollin was either not detected or detected as trace

concentrations in the culture medium as was described by Lozovaya et al. (2004b). Low levels of liquiritigenin were found in uninfected samples and the concentration increased many times after FSG treatment (Table 1). Liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin were not found in any of the other hairy root lines either before or after FSG treatment (Table 1).

To determine if liquiritigenin or isoliquiritigenin affected FSG growth the commercially available compounds were added to solid PDA medium at 75 μM and no effect on FSG growth was found: the FSG growth (area in mm) after 6 days on control medium was 21.43 ± 1.62, on liquiritigenin containing medium - 23.33 ± 1.63 and on isoliquiritigenin containing medium - 22.08 ± 1.11. This is in contrast to the known phytoalexin glyceollin that was inhibitory to FSG growth at concentrations as low as 25 μM (Lozovaya et al. 2004a). When FSG radial growth was measured after placing fungal plugs on the hairy roots, the most rapid growth occurred on the transformed roots with considerably decreased capacity to produce daidzein and in turn, glyceollin (Fig. 11). FSG also grew slightly faster on the Spencer control hairy roots than on the PI control.

### Discussion

The accumulation of phytoalexins has been known to be one of the important inducible plant responses caused by various pathogens. However, it has been difficult to directly prove the role of phytoalexins in disease resistance. The progress in plant transformation techniques has provided powerful tools to study the roles of specific natural products in plant responses to microbial attacks. While it is technically possible to

Tr trace. 16 (PI 567.374) and 78 (Spencer) are controls transformed with an empty plasmid with NPTII gene. Other lines are PI with IFS2 (34) or CHS6 (54) or Spencer with IFS2 (121) or CHS6 (104)
a number of hairy root lines with very low isoflavone concentrations (less than 10% of the controls) via genetic transformation with the *IFS2* and *CHS* genes in order to determine if a reduction in the synthesis of the precursors for glyceollin formation would affect root resistance to the fungal pathogen FSG. The soybean *IFS2* gene that was used for hairy root transformation in our experiments is known to be preferentially induced in elicitor-treated or pathogen-challenged tissues and showed weak expression in unchallenged roots (Dhaubhadel et al. 2003). It was also assumed that *CHS6* may be of special importance for plants under stress conditions (Akada et al. 1993). We found that these selected hairy root lines were not able to accumulate glyceollin and fungal infection developed much faster on such hairy roots.

The reason for the dramatic decrease of IFS activity (Fig. 6) and isoflavonoid synthesis (Fig. 8a) in the *IFS2*-transformed roots is apparently the homology-dependent *IFS2* gene silencing, since a soybean *IFS2* gene was used for the soybean hairy root transformation. Gene silencing or co-suppression is known to be a common phenomenon in plant genetic transformation resulting from recognition of sequence homology at the DNA or RNA levels (Meyer and Saedler 1996). Homology-mediated gene inactivation could also occur in the *CHS6*-transformed lines, since this gene is of soybean origin and represents one of an eight-member gene family. It has been reported that there is naturally occurring gene silencing in soybean seed coats mediated by a naturally existing *CHS* gene cluster that occurs in a tissue-specific manner (Tuteja et al. 2004). The nucleotide sequence homology between the *CHS1* and *CHS6* genes is 93%, but the *CHS6* gene is the most divergent member of this family. The selected lines used here also contained multiple integration events (Fig. 4) so the interaction of the transgene multiple copies could also result in homology-dependent gene silencing (Cogoni and Macino 1999). According to our RT-PCR data the transgenes are expressed in the transformed hairy roots lines used (Fig. 5), indicating that the genes are being transcribed and that apparently posttranscriptional gene silencing is occurring.

Even though isoflavone synthesis was dramatically reduced in roots transformed with either the *IFS2* or *CHS6* gene, the changes that occurred in other phenylpropanoids were quite different. Accumulation of liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin, precursors of daidzein (Fig. 1) occurred in *IFS2*-transformed roots resulting in the unusual bright yellow color phenotype, due to the yellow color of isoliquiritigenin. Importantly, only liquiritigenin was detected in hairy root culture medium (Table 1), especially after fungal inoculation.

The synthesis of flavanone from chalcone must be enzyme catalyzed in vivo (Wong and Moustafa 1966), so that our data indicate that the formation of isoflavonoids occurred through pathway involving CHI in IFS down-regulated hairy roots.

These lines also have increased (compared to the untransformed control) concentrations of soluble and cell wall bound hydroxycinnamic acids, mainly, *p*-hydroxybenzoic acid (Figs. 8, 9). In contrast, the *CHS6* hairy root lines contained several-fold higher concentrations of phenolic acids than all other lines with coumaric acid showing the greatest increase. These results indicate that the flux of metabolites in transformed hairy roots was shunted into the pathway branch that leads to the formation of cell wall phenolics, which might strengthen the cell wall barrier for pathogen penetration into cells. Interestingly, not only were there elevated concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acids in the cell walls (Fig. 9) but the composition of the cell wall phenolics was also altered with an increased proportion of H-unit derivatives apparently due to the increased concentrations of *p*-hydroxybenzoic acid and *p*-hydroxybenzoic aldehyde in the *IFS2*-transformed roots and to increased concentrations of *p*-hydroxybenzoic acid and *p*-hydroxybenzoic aldehyde and coumaric acid in the *CHS6*-transformed roots (Fig. 9 a, b). An increased incorporation of the unmethylated units into the cell wall should increase the resistance to microbial degradation due to accumulation of more condensed and crossed-linked cell wall phenolics (Barber and Mitchell 1997).

In our study we found for the first time that the down-regulation of enzymes of the (iso)flavonoid branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway affected the cell wall phenolic content and composition. Metabolites that were not used for isoflavonoid synthesis were reutilized for the formation of cell wall phenolics. Understanding the interactions between enzymes of different branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway could be critical for controlling various important functions of phenolic compounds via genetic engineering in order to improve valuable plant traits.

When FSG growth was measured on the hairy roots of the selected lines, the infection developed most aggressively on roots with down-regulated IFS and slightly less on the CHS down-regulated line (Fig. 10). The untransformed PI had the highest resistance among all lines tested. Even though we found that cell wall phenolics were also modified in the IFS- and CHS-down-regulated lines, one would expect that these alterations found in the cell wall phenolic composition and content could in part compensate for the weakened plant defensive arsenal caused by the lack of phy-toalexin, so that in the absence of cell wall modification described the fungus could be even more aggressive.

These results provide new evidence for the important role of phytoalexins in plant responses to fungal infection, since we found markedly decreased ability to combat a fungal pathogen by transformed roots that have dramatically reduced synthesis of the phytoalexin glyceollin caused by blocking the biosynthetic pathway via post-transcriptional silencing of genes that are important for the phytoalexin precursor synthesis. The data obtained also indicate that if glyceollin concentration could be increased by metabolic engineering then increased pathogen resistance could be attainable.
