### Abstract.

Melatonin acts both as a hormone of the pineal gland and as a local regulator molecule in various tissues. Quantities of total tissue melatonin exceed those released from the pineal. With regard to this dual role, to the orchestrating, systemic action on various target tissues, melatonin is highly pleiotropic. Numerous secondary effects result from the control of the circadian pacemaker and, in seasonal breeders, of the hypothalamic/pituitary hormonal axes. In mammals, various binding sites for melatonin have been identified, the membrane receptors MT₁ and MT₂, which are of utmost chronobiological importance, ROR and RZR isoforms as nuclear receptors from the retinoic acid receptor superfamily, quinone reductase 2, calmodulin, calreticulin, and mitochondrial binding sites. The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) MT₁ and MT₂ are capable of parallel or alternate signaling via different Gα subforms, in particular, Gαi₂/₃ and Gαq, and via Gβγ, as well. Multiple signaling can lead to the activation of different cascades and/or ion channels. Melatonin frequently decreases cAMP, but also activates phospholipase C and protein kinase C, acts via the MAP kinase and PI3 kinase/Akt pathways, modulates large conductance Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ and voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels. MT₁ and MT₂ can form homo and heterodimers, and MT₁ interacts with other proteins in the plasma membrane, such as an orphan GPCR, GPR50, and the PDZ domain scaffolding protein MUPP1, effects which negatively or positively influence signaling capacity. Cross-talks between different signaling pathways, including influences of the membrane receptors on nuclear binding sites, are discussed.

### 1. Introduction

The indoleamine melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) has become known as the hormone of the pineal gland, which conveys the signal “darkness,” a function that is related to both circadian and seasonal time measurement and includes chronobiotic effects, that is, the capacity of phase shifting, in a feedback loop, the circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) [1–3]. These actions are relatively well-understood, notwithstanding the necessity of clarification of some details. However, melatonin is not a hormone alone [4–6]. This indoleamine is additionally secreted via the pineal recess to the cerebrospinal fluid, in initial concentrations much higher than those released to the blood [7,8]. It is also produced in numerous extrapineal tissues and cells, such as retina, gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, leukocytes, membranous cochlea, Harderian gland, and, perhaps, also skin and brain areas [3–6,9,10]. In mammals, its overall amounts found in tissues exceed by orders of magnitude those present in the pineal and in the circulation. From the extrapineal sites, it is either only poorly released or, as in the case of the gastrointestinal tract, it can be secreted in high amounts as a postprandial surge, however, without profound chronobiological consequences [6,9,10]. Melatonin can be also taken up from the food and undergoes enterohepatic cycling [10,11]. One may notice in this context that melatonin is not only found in vertebrates, but also is present in various, phylogenetically distant taxa, including bacteria, algae, plants, fungi, and invertebrate animals [12–14]. It may even act as a phytohormone in various plants [15,16]. Although the nonvertebrate melatonin shall not be in the focus of this article, the wide distribution among organisms sheds light on a multiplicity of functions, which is also reflected by enormous differences in concentrations reported for the various species. In mammals, the pleiotropy of melatonin can be related to different levels of action, namely, (i) to distribution and density of receptors and other binding sites in the various tissues and cell types, (ii) to parallel or alternate signaling via different G proteins controlled by membrane-bound receptors, (iii) to multiple,

structurally divergent binding sites of different subcellular localization and, presumably, also (iv) to actions of melatonin metabolites formed in tissue-specific pathways. Signaling mechanisms and the levels of pleiotropy will be discussed in this overview, with particular reference to mammals.

## 2. Orchestrating hormone and local tissue factor

Before going into the details of the signaling mechanisms, it seems necessary to perceive the different roles that melatonin plays in a mammalian body. The classical one—of utmost physiological relevance—is that of a chemical mediator of darkness [1–4]. Basis is the rhythmic synthesis and release of melatonin from the pineal gland, to both the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid [1–4,7,8]. In its function as a hormone, it is arriving rhythmically at practically every tissue and cell. Responses will, of course, largely depend on the presence of receptors and other binding sites, but, additionally, interactions with reactive intermediates not requiring receptors have been assumed [3,6,12,17–19]. By virtue of its amphiphilicity, melatonin can easily cross membranes and, therefore, enter cells, so that actions may be expected which are independent of membrane receptors. The high-amplitude circadian rhythm of circulating melatonin can, thus, be “sensed” by many cells, even if they are devoid of classical membrane receptors for this hormone, which act via G protein-mediated signaling mechanisms. Therefore, a representation of the dark phase within the photoperiodic cycle seems to be possible in numerous places of the mammalian body. Nevertheless, membrane receptors for melatonin are present in many tissues, including, for example, vasculature, immune cells, and various vegetative organs [4,20]. The marked chronobiological, receptor-mediated effects exerted at the levels of peripheral tissues and cells can either consist of direct up or downregulations of enzymes, genes, and ion channels, or may cause synchronization of peripheral circadian oscillators present in numerous cells. These peripheral actions have to be discriminated from effects of melatonin on the central circadian pacemaker, the SCN, and, in seasonal breeders, on reproduction-related hypothalamic and hypophyseal structures, in particular, median eminence and pars tuberalis. Very high densities of membrane receptors have been found in both the SCN [20–24] and the pars tuberalis [22,24,25]. As will be discussed later in detail, the effects via membrane receptors in the SCN are responsible for the so-called chronobiotic actions, that is, phase-shifting at the circadian pacemaker SCN, with profound secondary effects on “slave” rhythms under control of this hypothalamic area.

However, melatonin’s role cannot be solely seen under the aforementioned aspects. Because of relatively high amounts outside the pineal and retina, another intermediate brain-derived structure, a view on the chronobiology of tissue melatonin reveals that the amplitudes of melatonin rhythms in several organs are much lower than in the circulation or can be even virtually absent [6,10,19,26]. This holds, in particular, for the gut and the Harderian gland. Anyway, the transmission of dark signals seems to be rather unlikely in organs such as bone marrow or gastrointestinal tract. Again, the conclusion has to be that melatonin plays additional roles in these tissues. However, it would be too simple to just assume that this additional role were exclusively direct radical scavenging, since, in stoichiometric terms, melatonin quantities would be frequently insufficient. Alternately, a role of tissue melatonin as a source of bioactive metabolites, which can be also formed to a certain extent by nonenzymatic mechanisms, should be taken into consideration [6,10,19,26]. Moreover, the antioxidant properties of melatonin, which may be particularly important in tissues rich in this indoleamine, are based on multiple actions. Some of them involve signaling and gene expression, while others seem to be exerted by interactions with enzymes, ion channels or electron transport. Collectively, these effects may predominantly serve radical avoidance rather than detoxification of radicals already formed [19,26].

In conclusion, the pleiotropy of melatonin is not only reflected by the existence of numerous target organs, but also by its formation in extrapineal sites, by low or almost absent circadian dynamics in some tissues, indicating additional noncircadian functions, by formation of bioactive metabolites, and by specific subcellular actions, for example, in mitochondria, which exceed the usual spectrum of hormonal signaling [4,6]. Although roles and signaling mechanisms of tissue melatonin are poorly understood to date, it seems that the coexistence of endo, para, auto, and intracrine actions of melatonin [5] goes beyond local feedback effects common to other hormones, which are mostly mediated by the same receptors, or variants of them, as found in the respective target organs. Additional binding sites different from membrane receptors may be of importance in the case of tissue melatonin. Moreover, melatonin displays as remarkable contextual diversity of functions, reaching from the control of circadian pacemakers and hypothalamic/pituitary axes to, for example, vasomotor effects, various facets of immunomodulation, antioxidant actions including expression of genes relevant to redox metabolism, direct and indirect anti-apoptotic effects, interference with NO signaling, other antie excitatory actions via ion channels and neurotransmitter systems, and modulation of mitochondrial electron flux.

## 3. Membrane receptors

Membrane receptors of melatonin were identified in the pioneering work by Reppert et al., who first cloned a receptor from Xenopus melanocytes and who later found homologs in other vertebrate species [27–29]. In mammals, two receptor subtypes are present, MT₁ and MT₂ (in earlier terminology called Mel₁a and Mel₁b) [20–24,28,29]. The original terminology is sometimes maintained in studies on nonmammalian vertebrates or in comparative work, because a third melatonin receptor type is present in these organisms, Mel₁c, to which no denomination corresponding to MT₁ or MT₂ is allowed, for formal reasons of nomenclature. Because of its absence in mammals, this third receptor subtype shall not be discussed here in detail. Only the hint shall be given that

184functionally different isoforms of Mel<sub>1c</sub> have been described, which deviate in signaling and cause decreases in cyclic GMP [30].

MT<sub>1</sub> and MT<sub>2</sub> are typical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) of 350 and 362 amino acids, respectively, with the characteristic seven transmembrane domains [20, 27, 28, 31, 32]. Glycosylation sites have been detected in the N-terminal region and, more importantly, the fourth intracellular loops of either receptor contain palmitoylatable cysteine residues [33], and the C-terminal domains putative phosphorylation sites for protein kinases A and C as well as casein kinases 1 and 2 [20]. Although receptor desensitization has been repeatedly discussed, for example, in the context of limited melatoninergic actions on sleep [34], relatively few studies have dealt with the analysis of downregulation, and have usually been conducted in transfected cells [33, 35, 36]. A recent study using site-directed mutagenesis [33] showed that neither the replacement of the palmitoylation site by alanine nor the truncation of the C-terminal domain containing the phosphorylation sites altered receptor affinity. However, the presence of both the lipid anchor and the C-terminal tail were required for G protein interaction, as judged from the lack of the cAMP response. The phosphorylation, but not the palmitoylation sites were required for internalization, indicating the usual internalization process via phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding. Internalization of MT<sub>2</sub> was also demonstrated in immortalized SCN2.2 cells [36], an effect relevant to circadian phase shifting as discussed next. In these experiments, recovery from the melatonin-induced decrease in surface-exposed MT<sub>2</sub> receptors required about 8 hours, a time span that may be related to the duration of a night. MT<sub>1</sub> was reported to be less efficiently internalized than MT<sub>2</sub> [37], an effect which may be of functional significance, but this study had been conducted in transfected CHO cells, so the relevance for major sites of action such as the SCN remains to be further clarified.

MT<sub>1</sub> and MT<sub>2</sub> differ in their affinities to the natural ligand. For the human receptors, K<sub>i</sub> values of 80.7 and 383 pM, respectively, have been determined [38]. This is in the range of that found in other species, although sometimes higher inhibition or dissociation constants have been reported [39].

MT<sub>1</sub> and MT<sub>2</sub> are found in numerous places, and all chronobiotic effects via the SCN are mediated by these two receptors [20, 29, 40]. In this pacemaker, melatonin affects, under both *in vivo* and *in vitro* conditions, circadian phase, and amplitude. Phase-shifting is preferentially exerted via MT<sub>2</sub>, whereas neuronal firing is acutely suppressed through MT<sub>1</sub> [20, 29, 40, 41]. However, the two receptor subtypes are complementary in their actions and can, to a limited extent, mutually substitute for each other. In the extreme, one of these receptors can be exceptionally missing, as shown in two Siberian hamsters, *Phodopus sungorus* and *Ph. campbelli* [42], which lack active MT<sub>2</sub> receptors.

The actions of melatonin on the circadian pacemaker SCN represent a feedback loop involved in the readjustment of the oscillator, since the mammalian pineal gland itself is under control of the SCN. Signaling mechanisms of melatonin have been most thoroughly studied in this pacemaker. The classical effect on both receptors is transmitted by pertussis toxin-sensitive G<sub>i</sub> proteins (Fig. 1), which cause a decrease in cAMP, followed by declines in PKA activity and CREB phosphorylation [20, 29, 43, 44]. The inhibition of adenylyl cyclase is not only evident in purely experimental situations, like counteraction of forskolin-induced rises [20, 43], but also in a context physiologically relevant to the SCN, namely, the antagonism to pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide (PACAP)-induced stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and CREB phosphorylation [29, 45]. Interestingly, melatonin failed to suppress the PACAP response of pCREB formation in aging mice [45], which indicates a loss of functional sensitivity of the SCN to the indoleamine.

MT<sub>1</sub> and MT<sub>2</sub> have been detected in many tissues, such as retina, other brain areas, choroid plexus, cerebral and peripheral vasculature, Harderian gland, reproductive organs including myometrium, and adrenal cortex [20, 46]. Despite low expression levels in some of these tissues, the ample distribution of the membrane receptors indicates melatonin responsiveness of numerous peripheral organs [46]. The most frequently involved α subforms are α<sub>i2</sub> and α<sub>i3</sub> [39, 47, 48]. Although α<sub>i</sub>-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase represents a prominent and most frequently observed effect, signaling via MT<sub>1</sub> and MT<sub>2</sub> can, in fact, be more complex [4, 20, 43, 44]. Parallel signaling through different G protein subforms and also βγ heterodimers (Fig. 1) has been observed in various tissues or cells, and even alternate signaling seems to exist in some cases. However, one should be aware that signal transduction via different G protein subforms is strongly cell type-specific and depends on the expression of the numerous variants of α subunits, and also on availability of their downstream interaction partners. Therefore, studies in transfected cells *in vitro* can only identify a spectrum of possibilities, but not the physiologically relevant route in a specific cell type *in vivo*. Moreover, overexpression of a receptor upon transfection enhances the probability of interaction with other partners including less abundant G proteins.

In the mammalian SCN, multiple signaling should, at least, be relevant in the case of MT<sub>2</sub>. In addition to the known decline in cAMP, MT<sub>2</sub> activation caused rises in PKC, which were blocked by the MT<sub>2</sub>-selective antagonist 4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetraline (4P-PDOT) and required for the phase shift of the circadian rhythm [40]. Corresponding results concerning the rises of PKC in relation to phase advances had been previously obtained [49]. Later, the findings on MT<sub>2</sub>-dependent PKC activation were confirmed in immortalized SCN2.2 cells [32]. PKC activation should not be the consequence of decreases in cAMP, but rather be based on other effects of G protein subunits. Several G protein-dependent activation mechanisms are possible, some of them involving phospholipase C (PLC) [50], in particular, isoforms of PLCβ or, perhaps, PLCη. This may be conveyed either by α<sub>i</sub> coupling to PLC subforms, which would be in line with the observed sensitivity to pertussis toxin, or alternatively, by another α subform, such as α<sub>q</sub>. The third possibility would consist in PLC activation by βγ (Fig. 1). Finally,

Fig. 1. Overview of parallel and cross signaling pathways of the melatonin membrane receptors. The figure combines various pathways, which are not collectively present in every target cell. Moreover, MT$_1$- and MT$_2$-dependent signaling pathways, which are only partially identical, are combined, because of possible heterodimerization and uncertainties concerning several cell types (for known differences see current text). Additional routes or interconnections are likely to exist. In particular, parallel signaling within the MAP kinase route, exceeding the mentioned ERK1/2 pathway, has been omitted. Dotted lines refer to assumed pathways, which deserve further substantiation in the tissues. Roles of Gα subunits and Gβγ dimers are only depicted for Gi and Gq proteins. Eventual functions of GRKs (G protein-coupled receptor kinases) are mentioned, because of wide abundance and experience with other GPCRs, although their relevance for melatonin receptors has not been shown.

indirect effects via G protein-dependent opening ion channels might lead to rises in PKC activity at the membrane.

In fact, melatonin-induced effects via $\alpha_{q}$ or via $\beta\gamma$ on PLC $\beta$ isoforms, and also pertussis toxin-sensitive opening of potassium channels have been observed in other tissues or transfected cells. In rat uterine myocytes, parallel signaling through $G_{i}$ and $G_{q}$ was demonstrated indirectly, by studying the opening of large-conductance Ca${}^{2+}$-activated K${}^{+}$ channels (BK${}_{Ca}$) [51]. A pertussis toxin-sensitive effect on channel opening was antagonized by isoproterenol and, thus, mediated by $\alpha_{i}$ via decreases on cAMP and PKA activity, whereas a pertussis toxin-insensitive effect, presumably mediated by $\alpha_{q}$, was blocked by the PLC inhibitor U-73122. Blockade of BK${}_{Ca}$ was also reported to inhibit the vasoconstrictor action of melatonin in cerebral and caudal arteries [20, 52, 53]. However, in one of the original studies [54], neither changes in cAMP nor in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis were induced by melatonin, so that authors assumed actions via Ca${}^{2+}$ influx. Inward rectifier K${}^{+}$ channels (Kir channels) were also concluded to serve as targets of melatonin receptors. In the Xenopus oocyte system [55] and in transfected AtT2o cells [56], Kir3.1 and 3.2 were shown to be activated by MT${}_{1}$, via a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism that involves presumably $\beta\gamma$, since these heterodimers are known to directly couple to Kir channels. Modulation of Ca${}^{2+}$ channels by melatonin, as observed in the rat pituitary, may be likewise mediated by $\beta\gamma$ [56]. Site-directed mutagenesis in MT${}_{1}$ allowed a dissection of cAMP downregulation and coupling to Kir3 channels [56]. High external K${}^{+}$, in turn, opens voltage-dependent Ca${}^{2+}$ channels, an effect which is inhibited by melatonin. Again, point mutations of MT${}_{1}$ analyzed in transfected AtT2o cells showed a loss of inhibition. However, the inhibition of voltage-gated Ca${}^{2+}$ channels was only partially blocked by pertussis toxin, so that parallel signaling by different G proteins seems likely [56]. These findings on MT${}_{1}$ signaling towards Kir and calcium channels are of high potential importance because they can presumably explain the MT${}_{1}$-mediated suppressive effects of melatonin on neuronal firing in the SCN, where these channels are expressed.

Parallel signaling involving other G proteins, such as $G_{q}/G_{11}$, $G_{o}$, $G_{z}$, or $G_{16}$, has been observed in various studies using transfected cells (HEK293, Cos-7, CHO cells), although some findings concerning $G_{o}$ and $G_{z}$ may be ambiguous. Collectively, these data show that both melatonin receptors can multiply interact with various, pertussis toxin-sensitive as well as -insensitive G proteins [4, 39, 47, 48, 57–60]. Although parallel signaling *per se* is, therefore, beyond doubt, many details concerning the various $\alpha$ subforms are awaiting further substantiation in the tissues.

Parallel signal transduction leads, in turn, to a host of secondary effects, especially when Ca${}^{2+}$ levels are involved. Activations of PLC and PKC, and also $\beta\gamma$ dimers released from $G_{i}$, stimulate the MAP kinase pathway (MEK${}_{1/2}$, ERK${}_{1/2}$, c-Jun N-terminal kinase = JNK), and additional effects via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream elements (e.g., Akt = PKB) as well as further modulation of various transcription factors are possible. However, the situation is insofar more complicated as ERK can also be activated via $\beta$-arrestin 2 bound to the phosphorylated receptor, as shown for many GPCRs [61]. The complex signaling network can include further interactions between, for example, JNK and PI3K, as well as activation of PI3K by $\beta\gamma$, among other possibilities. In fact, various of these secondary consequences have been reported [4, 58, 60]. Contrary to stimulations of cell proliferation, as could be expected from activation of the MAP kinase pathway, decreases of phospho-Akt by melatonin have been related to antiproliferative effects in HUVECs [62]. With regard to the possible and cell type-dependent complexity of the signaling pathways and their interconnections, much more information is required for relevant tissues *in vivo*, and generalizations should be avoided in the present state of knowledge.

Another potentially important aspect of melatonin signaling concerns effects on cGMP. Although rises in cGMP have been repeatedly observed (summarized in ref. 48), and despite assumptions concerning the involvement of cGMP phosphodiesterase, a gap is still existing concerning the direct demonstration of the responsible mechanism. Increases of cGMP were assumed to enhance calcium uptake through cyclic nucleotide-gated channels [49, 63], effects which would have numerous further consequences. On the other hand, MT${}_{2}$-mediated decreases in cGMP have been also described, especially when antagonizing the accumulation caused by IBMX in insulinoma $\beta$ cells [64]. Although these findings may be highly relevant for understanding the inhibition of insulin secretion by melatonin, such findings, as in any other cases of cGMP downregulation, would require clarification concerning the inhibition of NO synthases. In other studies, this has been addressed, but in an investigation on the inhibition of vascular bradykinin-induced rises in NO and cGMP, neither MT${}_{1}$, MT${}_{2}$ nor the melatonin binding protein QR2 were apparently involved [65].

The complexity of melatonin signaling through its membrane receptors is still worth of further detailed studies. It can even reveal previously unexpected effects, in which signaling pathways originating from MT${}_{1}$ and MT${}_{2}$ turn out to be antagonistic. In the vascular system, MT${}_{1}$ activation causes a pertussis toxin-sensitive vasoconstriction, perhaps involving BK${}_{Ca}$ channels as discussed above, whereas MT${}_{2}$ exerts vasodilator effects [4, 20].

A newly emerging field of melatonin membrane receptors is that of their interactions with proteins other than G proteins, protein kinases and phosphatases controlling C-terminal phosphorylation or $\beta$-arrestin binding to these sites (Fig. 2). A recent study showed an interaction between the C-tail of MT${}_{1}$—but not that of MT${}_{2}$—and the PDZ domain protein MUPP${}_{1}$ (PDZ = PSD-95/Drosophila disc large/ZO-1 homology; MUPP${}_{1}$ = multi-PDZ domain protein 1) [66]. Both proteins are expressed in the ovine pars tuberalis. Among the 13 PDZ domains present in MUPP${}_{1}$, PDZ${}_{10}$ is obviously responsible for functional interaction with the C-tail. Binding of MUPP${}_{1}$ to MT${}_{1}$ did not alter localization or trafficking, but its disruption, by coexpression of PDZ fragments in HEK293 cells, abolished the cAMP response and gradually diminished ERK phosphorylation, which should have been

With regard to experiences with other GPCRs, additional, cell type-specific heterodimerizations seem possible, but have not been demonstrated.

stimulated by βᵧ, so that MUPP₁ seems to be required for high-affinity binding of Gᵢ to MT₁. Another area of prospective significance is that of heterodimerization with other G protein-coupled receptors (Fig. 2). This phenomenon has been reported for numerous GPCRs and, moreover, relatively many members of this family are still orphan receptors and may exert regulatory effects on other GPCRs. Heterodimerization between MT₁ and MT₂ has been observed, as well as homodimerization of MT₁ and, to a lesser extent of MT₂ [67], but is has been debated to what extent this may represent overexpression artifacts in transfected cells. Nevertheless, both homo and heterodimerizations of GPCRs, and even formation of oligomer arrays are common phenomena, which are, however, only partially understood in their consequences, for example, for ligand affinity and internalization. In some cases, heterodimerizations are functionally obligatory, such as in the GABAₐ and various taste receptors [68]. With regard to the melatonin receptors, this is, however, an open field, which requires further attention. The melatonin-associated receptor GPR50 was shown to heterodimerize with MT₁, but not MT₂ (Fig. 2), thereby abolishing high-affinity agonist binding and G protein coupling [69]. According to that study, the C-terminal domain of GPR50 was required for the interaction with MT₁, although dimerizations of GPCRs are usually mediated by interactions of transmembrane helices (IV and V, plus additional forces involving I and II). GPR50 is still classified as an orphan receptor, but is has meanwhile been shown to be an ortholog of Mel₁c [70] and to be downregulated by short-days in the third ventricle ependymal layer of Siberian hamsters [71], a finding indicating physiological significance in seasonality. In principle, numerous further possibilities of heterodimerization with other GPCRs may exist, including their orphans, a field worth of future investigation.

4. The other binding sites

Much less is known about the other melatonin binding sites, although they may be of particular importance for tissue melatonin. A melatonin binding protein that was originally suspected to represent another membrane receptor, and already named MT₃, finally turned out to be a primarily cytosolic enzyme, quinone reductase 2 (= QR2 = NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 = NQO2; NRH = dihydronicotinamide riboside) [72,73]. Although several hypotheses have been forwarded, the function of melatonin at this enzyme is not really understood. Despite the development of several synthetic ligands for this binding site and the description of various effects [4,6], the lack of a known signaling pathway does not allow mechanistic conclusions.

Nuclear binding sites of melatonin have been a matter of considerable debate. Numerous publications have dealt with melatonin-binding transcription factors belonging to the retinoic acid receptor superfamily, in particular, RORα₁, RORα₂, RZRα, and RZRβ [3,74,75]. Their classification as nuclear receptors seems meanwhile justified, although their affinity to melatonin is lower (Kᵈ values in the lower nanomolar range). A synthetic ligand, CGP 52608 [74], has been

repeatedly used for identifying effects by these nuclear proteins. RORα1 and RORα2 seem to be involved in some aspects of immune modulation, and RZRβ is expressed in the central nervous system, including the pineal gland [3]. In the context of melatonin's protective actions, RORα was assumed to mediate upregulations of antioxidant enzymes [76]. Although response elements for these transcription factors have been identified [77, 78], and although transactivation in reporter assays has been demonstrated [79], most of the studies have been restricted to the demonstration of CGP 52608, so that the information on specific up or downregulation of individual genes has remained remarkably scarce. RZRα leads to the suppression of 5-lipoxygenase expression in B lymphocytes [80]. Recently, RORα was shown to upregulate HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α) expression [81], an effect which may go beyond the mere response to hypoxia and could be linked to antioxidant actions, because of HIF-1α modulation by free radicals. Another effect of potential importance was reported for the SCN, in which RORα was related to the upregulation of the *bmali* gene [78], that is, a clock gene playing an essential role in the cellular circadian oscillator. Whether this action is also involved in melatonin-induced phase shifting remains to be analyzed in detail. Heterodimerization, which is not uncommon with other retinoid receptors, and interference with other transcription factors have not been fully addressed for the melatonin-binding ROR/RZR isoforms. An earlier article [77] described binding of dimers of the COUP-TF transcription factor to the ROR/RZR response element. In summary, it seems that the full spectrum and physiological meaning of ROR/RZR receptors are awaiting more detailed investigation and future clarification.

As another melatonin-binding protein, calmodulin (CaM) was described. With regard to its numerous functions as a subunit and regulator of several protein kinases and other enzymes, an interaction with melatonin would be of considerable significance, if the affinity were sufficient. Although earlier studies indicated that melatonin binding could occur at elevated physiological concentrations [82, 83], more recent determinations speak for a much lower affinity [84, 85]. Thus, it remains open whether some important melatonin effects previously ascribed to interference with CaM, such as inhibitions of CaM kinase II [86] and of neuronal NO synthase [87], are indirectly caused via other signaling mechanisms, for example, starting from membrane receptors, or whether an indispensable player modulating affinity has been missing in the recent determinations.

Another calcium-binding protein, calreticulin, was also reported to represent a melatonin-binding protein [88]. In the same study, two other, functionally not yet characterized nuclear binding proteins, one of them with homology to calreticulin, were also described as putative binding sites. The relevance of these proteins in melatonin signaling remains to be identified. Finally, two mitochondrial binding sites have been identified. One of them exhibits only a relatively low affinity (IC₅₀ = 0.8 μM) and is associated with the inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a melatonin effect preventing apoptosis [89]. For the other one, a much higher affinity was determined (Kd = 150 pM) (data by M. Pappolla and B. Poeggeler, cited in ref. 6). Displacement studies with capsaicin and dopamine indicated localization at the amphipathic ramp of complex I in the electron transport chain [90]. This speaks for a modulatory role of melatonin at this bottleneck for electron flux, and the major site of electron leakage as well, but details will have to be worked out.

### 5. Conclusion

Although the multiple signaling pathways of melatonin, along with their cell type-specific consequences for the respective regulatory endpoints, may already appear highly complex, one should be aware that the pleiotropy of melatonin's actions is not yet fully described on that basis. The section on parallel signaling had already indicated that the cascades may be sometimes crosslinked, so that a single protein kinase or a transcription factor may be activated by mechanisms starting from different regulator molecules, such as Gα variants, βγ dimers, β-arrestin, or ion channels. The precise interconnections widely remain to be clarified. This complexity will be even higher, if different pathways are cross-talking to each other, which may occur at different levels. At the receptor level, this may start with heterodimerization. Cross-talks may even occur between entirely different receptor types for the same hormone, such as membrane and nuclear receptors of melatonin. A recent study on T lymphocytes and Jurkat cells indicated that the MT₁ receptor stimulates RORα expression [91]. Should this turn out to be a more general effect found in other cells, too, numerous, to date poorly understood, results might become explained.

With regard to the orchestrating function of melatonin, this indoleamine regulates the formation and secretion of numerous other hormones, and also acts antagonistic or synergistic to them in common target cells. Not only cross-talks between signaling mechanisms, but also countless secondary effects via changes in other hormone concentrations should result, a field exceeding by far the scope of this review. The same holds for interactions with different neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, and neurotrophin systems in the central nervous system, in which several interconnections with potential consequences for neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, neuroprotection, and aging have become apparent [92]. This network seems to comprise nonhepatic metabolites of melatonin, some of which are bioactive agents, too, such as 5-methoxytryptamine, N-acetylserotonin—which is not only precursor but also metabolite of melatonin—N¹-acetyl-N²-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK) and N¹-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AMK) (summarized in refs. 4, 6, and 92). Although many details remain to be identified, especially concerning the respective signaling cascades of the metabolites, such findings again shed light on the exceptional pleiotropy of melatonin, which exceeds receptor distribution and parallely or alternately activated G proteins.
