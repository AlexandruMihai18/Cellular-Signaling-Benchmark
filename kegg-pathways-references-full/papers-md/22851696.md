Abstract

Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is critically involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory disorders. IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) proximal signaling complex (IL-17R-Act1-TRAF6) is essential for IL-17 mediated NF-kB activation while IL-17-mediated mRNA stability is TRAF6 independent. Recently, IKKi has been identified to phosphorylate Act1 on Ser 311 to mediate IL-17-induced mRNA stability. Here we show TBK1, the other IKK-related kinase, directly phosphorylated Act1 on three other Ser sites to suppress IL-17 mediated NF-kB activation. IL-17 stimulation activated TBK1 and induced its association with Act1. IKKi also phosphorylated Act1 on the three serine sites and played a redundant role with TBK1 in suppressing IL-17-induced NF-kB activation. Act1 phosphorylation on the three sites inhibited its association with TRAF6 and consequently NF-kB activation in IL-17R signaling. Interestingly, TRAF6 but not TRAF3 which is the upstream adaptor of the IKK related kinases in antiviral signaling, was critical for IL-17 induced Act1 phosphorylation. TRAF6 was essential for IL-17-induced TBK1 activation, its association with Act1, and consequent Act1 phosphorylation. Our findings define a new role for the IKK-related kinases in suppressing IL-17-mediated NF-kB activation through TRAF6 dependent Act1 phosphorylation.

Introduction

Interleukin 17 (IL-17A or IL-17) was originally identified as a characteristic cytokine secreted by T_H17 cells (19). More IL-17 producing sources have now been found, especially innate immune cells (6, 23). IL-17 belongs to a cytokine family containing six members (IL-17A to IL-17F), which are structurally different from other cytokines (7, 8, 16, 26, 40). IL-17 is the most well characterized member of the family. IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine and acts on local tissues cells to induce production of proinflammatory genes including cytokines, chemokines and matrix metalloproteases to amplify inflammation (8, 16, 26). IL-17 level is elevated in variety of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, while IL-17 deficiency or its functional blockage reduces the development and pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, suggesting IL-17 is a promising target for various inflammatory disorders (16, 26).

While IL-17 family can induce common signaling pathways including NF-kB and MAPKs (P38, JNK and ERK) (8, 33), IL-17 receptor proximal signaling is being discovered and shown to be unique and tightly regulated (2, 3, 22, 27-29, 31, 32, 38). Act1 is identified as a key adaptor to recruit TRAF6 to IL-17R to mediate IL-17 induced NF-kB activation while TRAF3 and TRAF4 are found to interfere with the complex formation of IL-17R-Act1-TRAF6 (3, 27, 37, 38). Both Act1 and TRAF6 function as E3 ubiquitin ligases in IL-17R signaling (22). Act1 mediated poly-ubiquitination of TRAF6 leads to TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination which is required for IL-17 induced NF-kB activation and production of proinflammatory genes (22).

IL-17 has also been shown to stabilize mRNAs like the chemokine CXCL1 induced by TNF (11). IL-17 induced mRNA stability is Act1 dependent but TRAF6 independent (12).

Very recently, two studies report that IKKi and TRAF2-TRAF5 are important for IL-17-induced mRNA stability (1, 34). IKKi belongs to the IKK-related kinases which contain another kinase TBK1 (9, 17). The IKK-related kinases have been shown to have similar as well as differential roles in anti-viral signaling, autophagy and oncogenesis (5, 13, 15, 25, 30, 35, 36).

While IKKi have been found as a kinase to phosphorylate Act1 on Ser 311 to regulate TRAF6 independent function in IL-17R signaling in mouse system (1), it still remains to be determined whether there are other kinases to phosphorylate Act1 and whether Act1 can be phosphorylated on other sites in addition to Ser 311. Here we report that TBK1 is another direct kinase for Act1 and phosphorylates Act1 on three other serine sites in both human and mouse systems. IKKi also redundantly phosphorylates Act1 on these three sites in mouse system. Both TBK1 and IKKi suppressed IL-17 induced NF-kB activation through phosphorylating Act1 on the three sites. Mechanistic studies showed that TRAF6 was crucial for IL-17 induced TBK1 activation and its association with Act1 for the consequent Act1 phosphorylation. Act1 phosphorylation on the three sites interfered with its interaction with TRAF6 to suppress continuous inflammatory signaling. Our findings identify a new role for the IKK-related kinases in suppressing IL-17 mediated NF-kB activation and provide a molecular mechanism of how Act1 gets phosphorylated by these kinases for the negative feed-back regulation of IL-17R signaling.

The cDNAs encoding HA-tagged IKKa, IKKB, and NIK were constructed into pcDNA 3.1. The cDNAs encoding HA or Flag-tagged TBK1 and IKKi were cloned into pcDNA 3. The plasmid for Flag-tagged Act1 was previously described (31). The cDNAs encoding mouse Act1 and its point mutants including S147A, S209A, S222A, S147/209A and S147/209/222A (3SA), as well as mouse Flag-tagged TRAF6 and its mutants (Flag-TRAF6-K124R, Flag-TRAF6-C70A, Flag-TRAF6-ΔRing with residues 1 to 108 deleted) were constructed into the retroviral vector pMSCV-IRES-GFP. The cDNAs for human or mouse HA-tagged TBK1, IKKi, DNIKKi (K38A) and DNTBK1 (K38A) were subcloned into pMSCV-IRES-GFP.

112 Coimmunoprecipitations and Immunoblot Analysis. Coimmunoprecipitations and
113 Immunoblot Analysis were performed as previously described (17). HEK293T cells were
114 transfected with plasmids by a calcium phosphate transfection method. Cells untreated or
115 treated with IL-17 at different time points were harvested by washing with ice-cold PBS
116 and then lysed with Co-IP buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 150 mM
117 NaCl, 12.5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mM MgCl₂, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM
118 Na₃VO₄) freshly supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease
119 inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cell extracts were incubated with 0.5 μg appropriate antibody
120 and 20 μl protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). After overnight incubation, beads
121 were washed four times with the Co-IP buffer, boiled in protein loading buffer for 10 min
122 to release and denature immunoprecipitated proteins before separation on SDS-PAGE.
123 Cells were directly lysed in the Co-IP buffer as described above and separated by
124 SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis was performed by initial transfer of proteins onto
125 polyvinylidene fluoride filters using Mini Trans-Blot (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and
126 followed by a blocking step using Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 plus 5%
127 nonfat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then incubated with
128 primary antibody overnight and subsequently washed, followed by incubation with a
129 secondary antibody conjugated to HRP for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive
130 washing of the blots, signals were visualized with chemiluminescent HRP substrate
131 (Millipore).

133 Expression of recombinant Act1 GST fusion fragments. The cDNAs, encoding the
134 deletion mutants or point mutants of human Act1 (1-565) or mouse Act1 (1-555) as

shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7, were cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector. All constructs

were verified by sequencing. GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) *E. coli*

and purified with Glutathione Sepharose (GE Healthcare) according to the

manufacturer's instructions.

In vitro kinase assay. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding

Flag-tagged TBK1 or Flag-tagged IKKi by calcium phosphate precipitation. MEF cells

infected with retrovirus for Flag-IKKi were stimulated with IL-17(50ng/ml) for the

indicated times. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed using Co-IP buffer for

30 min on ice. Cell lysates were incubated with 0.5µg anti-M2 and 20 µl protein A

sepharose beads overnight at 4°C. The beads were washed twice with Co-IP buffer

following by two additional washes with kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mM

MgCl₂, 10 mM NaCl, 12.5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2

mM DTT, and 20µM ATP). Washed beads were incubated with 30 µl kinase buffer

including 1µCi of [γ-³²P] ATP and with/without the indicated recombinant GST fusion

proteins of Act1 for 30 min at 30°C. Reactions were stopped by boiling in protein loading

buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and the

incorporated radioactivity was detected by autoradiography.

Retroviral transduction. Retrovirus vectors and helper vectors were transfected into

293FT cells (Invitrogen) by calcium phosphate precipitation for viral packaging. At 60 h

after transfection, virus was collected for infection of target cells in the presence of

polybrene (10 mg/ml; Sigma). At day 4 after infection, cells were used for experiments.

RNAi and transfection.

Hela cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides and Lipofectamine-2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The siRNA sequence for human TRAF6 gene knockdown is 5'-GAUCCAGGGAU AUGAUGUAdTdT-3'; For human Actl gene knockdown is 5'-GCUUCAGAA CACUCUAUGUCUAdTdT-3'. The scrambled control siRNA sequence is 5'-UUCUCCGAA CGUGUGUCACGUdTdT-3'. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were collected for protein isolation.

RNA isolation and real-time quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For cDNA synthesis, RNA was reverse-transcribed with a PrimeScript RT Reagent kit (TaKaRa). The expression of the genes encoding Ccl20, Ccl2, KC, Cxcl2, IL-6, G-CSF, TNFα and IL-8 was quantified by real-time PCR with SYBR Premix ExTaq kit (TaKaRa). All gene expression results were normalized to expression of housekeeping gene Rpl13a. Amplification of cDNA was performed on an ABI Prism 7900 HT cycler (Applied Biosystems) and with the following primers: 5'-gcgaatcagaagcagcaag -3' and 5'-cgtgtgaagcccacaataaa -3' for human Ccl20; 5'-actgggtgaaaagggctgt -3' and 5'-gtccaattccatccccaaaaa -3' for mouse Ccl20; 5'-ttctgtgcc tgtgctgctcat -3' and 5'-ggggcatttgattgcatct -3' for human Ccl2; 5'-aggtccctgtcatgcttctg -3' and 5'-tctggaccattccttcttg -3' for mouse Ccl2; 5'-agacagcagagcacacaagc -3' and 5'-atggttcctccggtgtgt -3' for human IL-8; 5'-tctgcatcccccatag tta -3' and 5'-cttcaggaacagccaccagt -3'for human KC; 5'-agactccagcc cacactccaa -3' and 5'-

191 Statistics. Data are presented as means; error bars indicate ± SEM. A two-tailed
192 Student's t-test was used for analysis of differences between the groups. A one-way
193 analysis of variance was initially done to determine whether an overall statistically
194 significant change existed before analysis with a two-tailed paired or unpaired Student's
195 t-test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

Both TBK1 and IKKi are required for Act1 phosphorylation in IL-17R signaling.

Act1 has been shown to be phosphorylated upon IL-17 stimulation (1, 14, 31). Act1 has also been shown to interact with IKK complex (20, 21). We tested if IKK or related kinases were involved in Act1 phosphorylation. Interestingly, overexpression of TBK1 or IKKi, the IKK-related kinases, resulted in Act1 mobility shift while overexpression of the dominant negative of IKKi (the kinase dead mutant) did not, suggesting these two kinases are likely responsible for Act1 phosphorylation (Figure 1A). In contrast, overexpression of IKKa, IKKB or NIK did not lead to Act1 mobility shift, indicating Act1 was specifically phosphorylated by the IKK-related kinases (Figure 1A). To confirm the Act1 shift induced by the IKK-related kinases was due to phosphorylation, the cell lysates were treated with the shrine alkaline phosphatase (SAP) to remove kinase mediated protein phosphorylation. The SAP treatment indeed removed the Act1 mobility shift by overexpression of TBK1 or IKKi, suggesting the IKK-related kinases phosphorylated Act1 (Figure 1B). To see whether the IKK-related kinases are responsible for IL-17 induced Act1 phosphorylation, we made use of the TBK1^-/-^IKKi^-/-^ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (DKO MEFs). The IL-17 induced Act1 phosphorylation was severely reduced in the double deficient MEFs compared to wild-type cells (Figure 1C). To determine whether both kinases contributed to Act1 phosphorylation, the double deficient MEFs were infected with retrovirus encoding TBK1 or IKKi and then stimulated with IL-17. Restoration of either TBK1 or IKKi increased IL-17 induced Act1 phosphorylation (Figure 1D, top panel). TBK1 and IKKi together showed additive effects on Act1 phosphorylation (Figure 1D, top panel). We further found that the kinase dead mutants of

221 TBK1 or IKKi did not restore IL-17 induced Act1 phosphorylation in the DKO MEFs
222 (Figure 1D, bottom panel), indicating the kinase activity of the IKK-related kinases was
223 required for Act1 phosphorylation in IL-17R signaling. Similarly, we found that dominant
224 negatives of human IKKi or mouse TBK1 suppressed IL-17 induced Act1
225 phosphorylation in human U87-MG cells or wild-type MEFs respectively (data available
226 on request). Although IL-17 has been shown to induce IKKi activation for Act1
227 phosphorylation (1), here we show that TBK1 is also required for Act1 phosphorylation.
228 So we next checked whether TBK1 can be activated by IL-17 stimulation. Indeed, IL-17
229 stimulation resulted in TBK1 phosphorylation at Ser172, phosphorylation of which is
230 necessary for its kinase activity (18), in both human U87-MG cells (Figure 1E) and MEFs
231 (Figure 1F). Putting together, our data suggest that the kinase activity of both TBK1 and
232 IKKi are specifically and redundantly required for Act1 phosphorylation in IL-17R
233 signaling.

234

235 Act1 associates with the IKK-related kinases in an IL-17 signal dependent manner.
236 As kinases are supposed to associate with their substrates, we sought to determine
237 whether the IKK-related kinases really interact with Act1. We found that Act1 associated
238 with TBK1 or IKKi in an overexpression system (Figure 2A). We then checked if Act1
239 bound to the kinases in an IL-17 dependent manner. HeLa cells were infected with
240 retrovirus encoding HA-tagged TBK1 or HA-tagged IKKi, and then stimulated with
241 IL-17. Endogenous Act1 was indeed associated with the tagged TBK1 (Figure 2B) or
242 IKKi (Figure 2C) in a signal dependent manner. We further confirmed that IL-17
243 stimulation led to association of endogenous Act1 with endogenous TBK1 or IKKi in

244 both human HeLa cells (Figure 2D) and U87-MG cells (Figure 2E). Since IKKi has been
245 shown to interact with Act1 in MEFs, we further investigated the association of Act1 with
246 TBK1 in MEFs. We found that IL-17 stimulation resulted in Act1 binding to HA-tagged
247 TBK1 as well as phosphorylated TBK1 (Figure 2F). The IL-17 induced association of
248 Act1 with phosphorylated TBK1 was also confirmed in an endogenous system (Figure
249 2G). Domain deletion analyses showed that domain 182-282 of human Act1 mediated its
250 association with TBK1 or IKKi (data available on request). Together, our results firmly
251 establish that the IKK-related kinases talk to Act1 in IL-17R signaling in both human and
252 mouse cells.
253
254 The IKK-related kinases suppress IL-17 induced NF-κB activation.
255 To determine the potential role of the IKK-related kinases in IL-17 mediated signaling,
256 we utilized the dominant negatives of IKKi or TBK1 which inhibited IL-17 induced Act1
257 phosphorylation. HeLa cells were first infected with retrovirus encoding these dominant
258 negatives or their wild-type controls and then stimulated with IL-17. Either dominant
259 negative TBK1 or dominant negative IKKi greatly enhanced while wild-type TBK1 or
260 IKKi suppressed IL-17 induced NF-κB activation (p-IkBα) in human HeLa cells (Figure
261 3A, B). Similarly, these dominant negatives increased while their wild-type controls
262 suppressed IL-17 induced NF-κB activation in human U87-MG cells (Figure 3C, D).
263 These results suggest the IKK-related kinases suppress IL-17 induced NF-κB activation.
264 Consistently, the dominant negative of IKKi significantly increased IL-17 induced
265 downstream gene production in both HeLa cells (Figure 3E) and U87-MG cells (Figure
266 3F). As it is reported that IKKi does not affect IL-17-induced NF-κB activation in mouse

267 airway epithelial cells (1), we reasoned that the dominant-negative of IKKi not just  
268 affects IKKi mediated function and may also affect TBK1 mediated function. We indeed  
269 found that overexpression of the dominant-negative IKKi interfered with the association  
270 of TBK1 with Act1 in IL-17-dependent manner probably because of the competitive  
271 binding of the dominant negative to Act1 (data not shown).  
272 We then checked the function of the IKK-related kinases in mouse system through  
273 restoration of IKKi or TBK1 to the DKO MEFs. Restoration of either IKKi or TBK1  
274 suppressed IL-17 induced NF-kB activation (Figure 4A). Similarly, restoration of IKKi,  
275 TBK1 or both significantly inhibited IL-17 induced gene production while expression of  
276 the dominant negative of TBK1 (the kinase dead mutant) had no suppressive effect in the  
277 DKO cells (Figure 4B). It is reported that IKKi expression is low in MEFs (25). Similar  
278 to the results from DKO MEFs, we observed that restoration of TBK1 to TBK1 deficient  
279 MEFs suppressed IL-17 mediated activation of NF-kB and JNK (Figure 5A).  
280 Consistently, restoration of TBK1 inhibited IL-17-induced downstream gene production  
281 (Figure 5B). Although IKKi is shown to be required for IL-17-induced mRNA stability of  
282 KC (1), we found that TBK1 was not required for this pathway (data available on  
283 request), suggesting IKKi and TBK1 have differential roles in IL-17R-mediated signaling.  
284 Together, our results from both human and mouse systems suggest that the IKK-related  
285 kinases play a suppressive and likely redundant role in IL-17-induced NF-kB activation.  
286  
287 The IKK-related kinases redundantly phosphorylate Act1 at three serine sites.  
288 To look for the phosphorylation sites in Act1 by the IKK-related kinases, we constructed  
289 different GST-tagged deletion mutants of human Act1 (Figure 6A). These GST fusion  


proteins were expressed in *E. coli* and purified with Glutathione Sepharose (Figure 6A).

We then constructed Flag-tagged human TBK1 or Flag-tagged human IKKi. The Flag-tagged proteins were expressed in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated by anti-M2 (Flag) antibodies for in vitro kinase assay. IKKi phosphorylated Act1 at the region of 1-400 amino acids (aa) but not at the C-terminal region of 390-565 aa (Figure 6B). Further deletion analyses showed IKKi phosphorylated Act1 at the regions of 121-191 aa as well as 191-330 aa (Figure 6B). TBK1 phosphorylated Act1 at the same regions as IKKi (Figure 6C). As the IKK-related kinases have been shown to phosphorylate their substrates at serine sites, we then compared Act1 sequences from different species for conserved serine sites in the two regions (Figure 6D, E). The closely located and conserved serine sites (143, 146, 149 or 156, 159, 162) in the region of 121-191 were mutated at the same time (Figure 6D). The in vitro kinase assays showed combined mutation of three serine sites (156, 159, 162) blocked TBK1 or IKKi mediated phosphorylation of the Act1 region (Figure 6F). Further single serine mutation showed that Ser 162 was the phosphorylation site by TBK1 or IKKi in the Act1 region of 121-191 (Figure 6F). We then mutated the four conserved serine sites at the region of 191-330 altogether (Figure 6E), and found that the mutation blocked either TBK1 or IKKi mediated phosphorylation of the Act1 region (Figure 6G). Combined mutation of three serine sites (Ser 201, Ser 220 and Ser 233) showed the same blockage of phosphorylation (Figure 6G). We then mutated the serine sites either singly or with different combinations of two sites, and found that IKKi phosphorylated Ser 220 while TBK1 phosphorylated Ser 220 and Ser 233 (Figure 6G, H). Thus, in human system, IKKi phosphorylates Act1 at two sites (Ser 162 and Ser 220) while TBK1 phosphorylates Act1 at three sites (Ser 162,

313 Ser 220 and Ser 233). However, in mouse system, all the three equivalent serine sites
314 (Ser 147, Ser 209 and Ser 222) in mouse Act1 are utilized by both mouse TBK1 and mouse
315 IKKi (Figure 7).
316 To see whether the three serine sites in Act1 phosphorylated by the IKK-related kinases
317 in the in vitro assays are utilized in IL-17R signaling, we restored wild-type Act1 or
318 individual serine point mutants of Act1 into Act1 deficient MEFs and then checked IL-17
319 induced Act1 phosphorylation. Although the levels of IL-17 induced Act1 phosphorylation
320 were not obvious altered in the three single mutants (S147A, S209A or S222A) compared
321 to wild-type Act1, their mobility shifts appear lower than that of wild-type Act1,
322 indicating that IL-17 induced phosphorylation of all the sites (Figure 8A). Similar result
323 was found for the Act1 double site mutant at both Ser 147 and Ser 209 (Figure 8B).
324 However, when all the three serine sites (3SA) were mutated, IL-17 induced Act1
325 phosphorylation was severely reduced (Figure 8C), indicating that the three serine sites
326 are the major ones of Act1 phosphorylation in IL-17R signaling.
327
328 Act1 phosphorylation at the three serine sites inhibits IL-17-mediated NF-kB
329 activation.
330 Our results showed that the IKK-related kinases were required for IL-17 induced Act1
331 phosphorylation and suppressed IL-17 induced NF-kB activation (Figure 1, 3, 4). As the
332 mouse IKK-related kinases phosphorylated Act1 at the same sites (Ser 147, Ser 209 and
333 Ser 222), we sought to determine whether Act1 phosphorylation at these sites plays a
334 negative role in IL-17 induced NF-kB activation. Consistent with the suppressive role of
335 the IKK-related kinases, mutation of the three Ser sites of Act1 enhanced IL-17 induced

336 NF-κB activation and JNK activation (Figure 9A). Similarly, mutation of these sites
337 increased IL-17 induced downstream gene production (Figure 9B). As Act1 association
338 with TRAF6 is essential for IL-17 induced NF-κB activation, we asked whether Act1
339 phosphorylation at these serine sites by the IKK-related kinases might affect the
340 interaction of Act1 with TRAF6 to exert a suppressive role. The IL-17 induced
341 association of Act1 with TRAF6 was indeed increased in the double deficient MEFs of
342 TBK1 and IKKi, compared to wild-type MEFs (Figure 9C). Similarly, mutation of the
343 three Ser sites of Act1 enhanced IL-17 induced binding of Act1 to TRAF6 (Figure 9D).
344 Our results suggest that upon IL-17 stimulation the IKK-related kinases redundantly
345 phosphorylate Act1 on the three Ser sites, and the Act1 phosphorylation may lead to Act1
346 conformational change to interfere with its association with TRAF6 for NF-κB and JNK
347 activation.
348
349 TRAF6 is required for IL-17-induced Act1 phosphorylation.
350 TRAF3 is essential for the IKK-related kinases mediated IRF3 phosphorylation in
351 Toll-like receptors (TLR) or RIG-I-like receptors (RLR) mediated antiviral signaling (17).
352 We have previously shown that TRAF3 suppresses IL-17R mediated NF-κB activation
353 (38). We reasoned that TRAF3 might be involved in Act1 phosphorylation in IL-17R
354 signaling. We unexpectedly found that TRAF3 deficiency did not affect IL-17 induced
355 Act1 phosphorylation (Figure 10A). Surprisingly, we found TRAF6 was required for
356 IL-17 induced Act1 phosphorylation (Figure 10B), although TRAF6 has been reported to
357 function downstream of Act1 to mediate IL-17 induced NF-κB activation (22, 27). As
358 primary MEF cells may vary in their responses to IL-17, we restored TRAF6 to TRAF6

359 deficient MEFs and found that TRAF 6 reconstituted IL-17 induced Act1 phosphorylation
360 (Figure 10C), confirming that TRAF 6 was critical for Act1 phosphorylation. It is worth to
361 note that there is still TRAF 6 independent phosphorylation of Act1 as IL-17-induced
362 Act1 phosphorylation was not totally blocked although severely reduced in TRAF 6
363 deficient MEFs (Figure 10B, C). TRAF 6 is a ring-type E3 ubiquitin ligase and its E3
364 activity is important for NF-kB activation induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines like
365 IL-1 and IL-17 (4, 22). We found that TRAF6E3 deletion mutant (∆Ring) or E3 point
366 mutant (C70A) did not obviously restore IL-17-induced Act1 phosphorylation while
367 wild-type TRAF6 did (Figure 10D), indicating TRAF6E3 ligase activity was required for
368 Act1 phosphorylation. While TRAF 6 auto-ubiquitination is essential for its downstream
369 NF-kB activation (4, 22), we found that TRAF 6 auto-ubiquitination was not important
370 for Act1 phosphorylation as TRAF 6 auto-ubiquitination site mutant (K124R) still
371 restored IL-17 induced Act1 phosphorylation in TRAF 6 deficient MEFs (Figure 10E).
372 TRAF 6 activates NF-kB through TAK1 complex in IL-17R signaling (39). We then
373 checked if TAK1 is involved in Act1 phosphorylation and found that TAK1 was not
374 required for IL-17-induced Act1 phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus our findings
375 show TRAF 6 is specifically and uniquely required for Act1 phosphorylation in IL-17R
376 signaling.
377
378 TRAF 6 is essential for IL-17-induced TBK1 activation and its association with Act1.
379 As TRAF 6 is required for Act1 phosphorylation, we determined whether TRAF 6
380 mediates the activation of the IKK-related kinases. We found that siRNA mediated
381 TRAF 6 knock-down also blocked IL-17-induced TBK1 phosphorylation (Figure 11A),

382 suggesting that TRAF6 is required for IL-17-induced TBK1 activation. We next asked
383 whether TRAF6 is required for IKKi activation. As there is no p-IKKi antibody, we did
384 an in vitro kinase assay and found that TRAF6 appeared not essential for IKKi activation
385 although the assay did not show strong kinase activity (Figure 11B). It is reported that
386 Act1 is required for IKKi activation (1). We also found that Act1 was essential for TBK1
387 activation (Figure 11C). These data suggest that the IKK-related kinases are differentially
388 activated. The detailed activation mechanisms still remain to be further explored.
389 We then determined whether TRAF6 is also required for the association of Act1 with the
390 IKK-related kinases. We found TRAF6 deficiency completely blocked IL-17-induced
391 association of Act1 with TBK1 (Figure 11D). TRAF6 deficiency also reduced but not
392 completely blocked IL-17-induced binding of Act1 to IKKi (Figure 11D), indicating that
393 IKKi has TRAF6 dependent and independent roles while TBK1 only has TRAF6
394 dependent function in IL-17R signaling. Consistent with the dual roles of IKKi, we also
395 found that mutation (the 3SA mutant) of Act1 phosphorylation by the IKK-related kinases,
396 has no effect on IL-17-induced mRNA stability of KC, and did not affect IL-17-induced
397 association of Act1 with IKKi (data not shown). We then checked whether TRAF6E3
398 ligase activity was important for the association of Act1 with the IKK-related kinases. We
399 found that the TRAF6E3 deletion mutant or point mutant failed to restore IL-17-induced
400 association of Act1 with the IKK related kinases in the TRAF6 deficient MEFs while
401 wild-type TRAF6 did (Figure 11E), suggesting that TRAF6E3 activity was critical for
402 the association. We then asked if human system has the same phenomenon as the mouse
403 system. The ring deletion mutant of human TRAF6 was used as a dominant negative to
404 test its effect on the association of Act1 with the IKK-related kinases in human U87-MG

cells. The dominant negative severely reduced IL-17 induced binding of Actl to IKKi or

phosphorylated TBK1 as well as NF-kB activation (Figure 11F), indicating TRAF6 E3

ligase activity was also critical for IL-17 induced association of Actl with the

IKK-related kinases in human system. We next sought to determine whether TRAF6

directly associated with the IKK-related kinases for their subsequent interaction with

Actl. We did not detect IL-17-induced association of TRAF6 with the IKK-related

kinases (data not shown), indicating TRAF6 may indirectly mediate the association of

Actl with the IKK-related kinases.

414 Discussion

415 IL-17 is a key proinflammatory cytokine critically involved in the pathogenesis of variety

416 of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Act1 and TRAF6 are essential signaling

417 components for IL-17-mediated activation of NF-kB. Here we discovered a new role for

418 the IKK-related kinases (TBK1 and IKKi) in suppressing IL-17-induced NF-kB

419 activation through TRAF6 dependent Act1 phosphorylation. Both kinases directly

420 phosphorylated Act1 on three serine sites for their suppressive effects. TRAF6 was

421 critical for IL-17 induced TBK1 activation and the association of Act1 with the

422 IKK-related kinases, and the consequent Act1 phosphorylation. Our study demonstrates a

423 negative feedback loop (Act1-TRAF6-TBK1/IKKi-Act1) in regulation of

424 IL-17R-mediated NF-kB activation (Figure 12).

425 Very recently Bulek et al reported that IKKi phosphorylates Act1 on Ser311 to mediate

426 TRAF6 independent mRNA stability (1). We here show that TBK1 is another direct

427 kinase for Act1 phosphorylation. We found that TBK1 was activated and associated with

428 Act1 upon IL-17 stimulation. Instead of regulating TRAF6 independent mRNA stability,

429 TBK1 phosphorylated Act1 on three other Serine sites and suppressed IL-17-mediated

430 TRAF6 dependent NF-kB activation in both human and mouse systems. In addition to

431 the reported TRAF6 independent role, here we show that IKKi also has a TRAF6

432 dependent role. We found that TBK1 and IKKi did not depend on each other to

433 phosphorylate Act1, they phosphorylated Act1 on the same three Ser sites, and Act1

434 phosphorylation on these sites interfered with its association with TRAF6 for continuous

435 positive signaling, suggesting that IKKi plays a redundant role with TBK1 in Act1

436 phosphorylation to repress TRAF6 dependent NF-kB activation in IL-17R signaling.

437 Bulek's report, IL-17-induced NF-κB activation was not shown affected in IKKi deficient
438 airway epithelial cells, consistent with the redundant role of the IKK related kinases in
439 our study. However, we noticed in that report that IKKi has some positive effects on the
440 gene production induced by IL-17 alone although the effects are minor compared to the
441 essential role of IKKi for IL-17-mediated mRNA stability of the genes induced by TNF
442 in airway epithelial cells. Here we found that IKKi and TBK1 redundantly mediated
443 negative effects on IL-17-induced gene production. The difference may be due to that the
444 two kinases together mediated negative effects exceed the minor positive effect by IKKi
445 alone. It may also due to cell type specific effects.
446 
447 TBK1 and IKKi are structurally related to IKK kinases (IKKα and IKKβ) and sharing
448 some substrates such as IkBα and P65 for NF-κB activation (9, 30). Instead of activating
449 NF-κB, the IKK-related kinases repressed IL-17-mediated NF-κB activation. This could
450 be due to their substrate specificity because we observed that TBK1 and IKKi but not
451 IKKα and IKKβ phosphorylated Act1 although Act1 has been reported to associate with
452 the IKK complex (20, 21). TAK1 was also found not involved in Act1 phosphorylation.
453 We noticed that IL-17-induced Act1 phosphorylation was not totally blocked although
454 severely impaired upon double deficiency of TBK1 and IKKi, suggesting there may be
455 existence of other kinases for Act1. Although the IKK-related kinases have differential
456 expression pattern that TBK1 is constitutively expressed while IKKi is an inducible
457 kinase (9, 30), both kinases redundantly phosphorylate mouse Act1 on the three Ser sites
458 (Ser147, Ser209 and Ser222). It is reported that Act1 is also phosphorylated on Ser311 by
459 IKKi in IL-17R signaling (1). Consistent with the extra site, our data showed

460 IL-17-induced Act1 phosphorylation was not totally blocked in the mutant (3SA) of the
461 three Act1 phosphorylation sites although severely reduced. We further found that
462 mutation of the three sites (3SA) did not affect Act1 association with IKKi or
463 IL-17-induced mRNA stability of KC, indicating the phosphorylation of these three Ser
464 sites may not affect the Ser311 phosphorylation which is required for IL-17-induced
465 mRNA stability of KC. On the other way, Ser311 phosphorlation did not affect TRAF6
466 dependent NF-kB pathway and Ser311 mutation only reduced but not blocked
467 IL-17-induced Act1 phosphorylation in Bulek's report, suggesting Ser311 phosphorylation
468 may not affect the phosphorlation of the three Ser sites in Act1 described in our study. It
469 is worth to note that the shifted band detected by the Act1 antibody is not sensitive
470 enough to detect all Act1 phosphorylation. It still remains to be determined whether there
471 are potential other phosphorylation sites in Act1 by the sensitive mass spectrometry
472 approach in addition to the determined four sites.
473 
474 The IKK-related kinases have been well studied for their roles in antiviral signaling.
475 TRAF3 but not TRAF6 is the upstream adaptor for activation of the IKK-related kinases
476 to phosphorylate the transcription factor IRF3 for antiviral responses (10, 24). However,
477 we found that TRAF6 but not TRAF3 was important for IL-17-induced Act1
478 phosphorylation, indicating the functional specificity for the IKK-related kinases in
479 IL-17R signaling. We have previously reported that Act1 is an upstream adaptor to recruit
480 TRAF6 to IL-17R (27). Considering the TRAF6-dependent Act1 phosphorylation plays a
481 negative role in IL-17-induced NF-kB activation and IL-17 induced binding kinetics of
482 Act1 and the IKK-related kinases is slower than that of Act1 and TRAF6, it is likely that

483 after TRAF 6 activation, Act1 is phosphorylated to immediately turn off the NF-κB
484 pathway. Consistent with that, the double deficiency of the IKK-related kinases or
485 mutation of the Act1 phosphorylation sites (3SA) enhanced IL-17 induced interaction of
486 Act1 and TRAF 6, suggesting Act1 phosphorylation may lead to its conformation change
487 which interferes with its association with TRAF 6. Although both TBK1 and IKKi
488 redundantly phosphorylate Act1 on the same three Ser sites, the activation of the kinases
489 and their association with Act1 are differentially regulated. TRAF 6 is only essential for
490 TBK1 activation, while Act1 is required for activation of both kinases. The regulation of
491 Act1 association with TBK1 or IKKi is also different. IL-17-induced association of TBK1
492 with Act1 is totally TRAF 6 dependent, while the association of Act1 with IKKi is both
493 TRAF 6 dependent and independent. Although the detailed mechanisms for the
494 differential regulation remain to be further identified, these data are consistent with the
495 differential roles of the IKK related kinases in IL-17R signaling, that is, TBK1 only
496 regulates TRAF 6 dependent signaling while IKKi plays dual roles in both TRAF 6
497 dependent NF-κB activation and TRAF 6 independent mRNA stability. The redundant and
498 differential roles of TBK1 and IKKi have also been observed in other signaling involved
499 in antiviral and antibacterial immunity, and in cancer (5, 9, 30).
500
501 The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and auto-ubiquitination of TRAF 6 are essential for IL-17
502 induced NF-κB activity, similar to other TRAF 6 mediated signaling pathways (4, 22).
503 Here we found TRAF6E3 ligase activity was also critical for IL-17 induced association
504 of Act1 with the IKK-related kinases, and consequent Act1 phosphorylation. However,
505 TRAF 6 auto-ubiquitination was found not important for IL-17 induced TRAF 6

506 dependent Act1 phosphorylation, suggesting that TRAF6 likely ubiquitinates its  
507 downstream signaling molecules for Act1 phosphorylation. We did not detect direct  
508 association of TRAF6 with the IKK-related kinases in IL-17R signaling. Considering  
509 TRAF6 mediates Lys-63 type ubiquitination and we did not detect IL-17 induced Lys-63  
510 ubiquitination of Act1 (data not shown), it is not likely for TRAF6 to ubiquitinate Act1  
511 for its association with the IKK-related kinases. Therefore, TRAF6 may ubiquitinate  
512 unknown molecules to mediate the association of Act1 with the IKK-related kinases for  
513 subsequent Act1 phosphorylation.  

514  

515 In conclusion, we demonstrate TBK1 is another direct kinase for Act1 phosphorylation in  
516 IL-17R signaling. Both TBK1 and IKKi redundantly phosphorylate Act1 to suppress IL-17  
517 induced NF-kB activation. TRAF6 is required for IL-17-induced association of Act1 with  
518 the IKK-related kinases, and consequent phosphorylation of Act1. Our findings identify a  
519 new role for the IKK-related kinases in suppressing IL-17-induced TRAF6 dependent  
520 NF-kB activation and provide a negative feedback loop mechanism in the regulation of  
521 IL-17R signaling.

(D and E) Endogenous Act1 is associated with the endogenous IKK-related kinases in an

IL-17 signal dependent manner. Lysates from HeLa cells (D) or U87-MG cells (E) treated

with IL-17 (50ng/ml) for the indicated time points were immunoprecipitated with

anti-Act1 or IgG, followed by immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies.

(F and G) IL-17 stimulation results in Act1 binding to the IKK related kinases in mouse

cells. MEF cells infected with retrovirus for HA-tagged TBK1 (F) or un-infected (G),

were treated with IL-17 for 0, 15 or 30min, and then cell lysates were

immunoprecipitated with anti-Act1, followed by immunoblot analysis with the indicated

antibodies.

Figure 3. The IKK-related kinases suppress IL-17-induced NF-κB activation in

human system.

(A–D) The IKK related kinases repress IL-17-induced NF-κB activation. (A and B) Hela

cells infected with control virus (EV) or retrovirus encoding HA-tagged DNTBK1,

WT-TBK1 (A); or HA-tagged DNIKKi, WT-IKKi (B), were treated with IL-17 for the

indicated times. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with antibodies against p-IκBα,

HA and Actin. (C and D) U87-MG cells infected with retroviral control or retrovirus for

HA-tagged DNTBK1, WT-TBK1 (C); or HA-tagged DNIKKi, WT-IKKi (D), were left

untreated or treated with IL-17 for the indicated times. Lysates were analyzed by

immunoblot with antibodies against p-IκBα, HA and Actin.

(E and F) The dominant negative of IKKi significantly increases IL-17-induced gene production. Hela cells (E) or U87-MG (F) were infected with retroviral control or virus for HA-tagged DNIKKi and then untreated or treated with IL-17 for 2h. The induction of Ccl20, Ccl2, IL-8, Cxcl2, IL-6, TNF and KC mRNA was measured by real-time PCR. Graphs in (E and F) show mean and SEM, n = 3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 (student’s t-test).

Figure 4. The IKK-related kinases suppress IL-17-induced NF-κB activation in mouse system.

(A) Restoration of the IKK-related kinases to DKO MEFs greatly suppresses IL-17-induced NF-κB activation. DKO MEFs infected with retroviral control or virus for HA-tagged IKKi, HA-tagged TBK1 were left untreated or treated with IL-17 for the indicated time points. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with antibodies against p-I-κBα and Actin. Protein expression of HA-TBK1 and HA-IKKi in DKO MEFs are shown in the right panel.

(B) Restoration of the IKK-related kinases to DKO MEFs significantly inhibits IL-17-induced gene production. DKO MEFs infected with retroviral control or virus for HA-tagged IKKi, TBK1, TBK1+IKKi, or DNTBK1 respectively, were left untreated or treated with IL-17 for 1h. The induction of Ccl20, Ccl2, Cxcl2, IL-6, KC and G-CSF mRNA was analyzed by real-time PCR. Graphs in (B) show mean and SEM, n = 3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 (student’s t-test).

(A) TBK1⁻/⁻ MEF cells infected with retrovirus encoding empty vector (EV) or HA-tagged mTBK1, were treated with IL-17 (50ng/ml) for 0, 7.5, 15 or 30min. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with indicated antibodies. Arrowhead indicates the shifted (phosphorylated) Act1 band.

(B) TBK1⁻/⁻ MEF cells reconstituted with HA-tagged mTBK1 or empty vector (EV) were left untreated or treated with IL-17 for 1h. The induction of Ccl20, Ccl2, Cxcl2 and KC mRNA was measured by real-time PCR. Graphs show mean and SEM, n = 3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 (student's t-test).

Figure 6. The IKK-related kinases phosphorylate human Act1 at Ser162, Ser220 and Ser233.

(A) Schematic representation of human Act1 protein. The major isoform of human Act1 contains 565 amino acids. The indicated regions of Act1 were expressed as recombinant GST fusion proteins in E. coli and purified with Glutathione Sepharose. The fusion proteins for in vitro kinase assay in (B and C) were subjected to coomassie blue staining (CB). “*” indicates target protein. Molecular mass is indicated in kilodalton next to the gel blots.

(B and C) IKKi (B) or TBK1 (C) phosphorylates Act1 at the regions of 121-191aa and 191-330aa. Flag-tagged IKKi (B) or TBK1 (C) was expressed and immunoprecipitated

with anti-M2 from HEK293T cells and incubated with the recombinant proteins of hAct1

truncations as indicated in (A). The incorporated radioactivity was detected by

autoradiography. Arrows indicate IKKi or TBK1 autophosphorylation. “☆” indicates

phosphotylated Act1.

(D and E) Conserved serine sites are showed by amino acid alignment of Act1 protein

sequences. Alignment of Act1 protein sequences in different species was performed by

the Multiple Sequence Alignment ClustalW 2. S143-S146-S149 and S156-S159-S162

residues in human Act1 121-191aa (D) and S201, S220, S233, S256 residues in human

Act1 191-330aa (E) are indicated by arrows.

(F) IKKi or TBK1 phosphorylates Ser 162 of Act1 in the region of 121-191aa. The

indicated point mutants of GST-hAct1 121-191 were used as substrates for Flag-tagged

IKKi (top pannel) or TBK1 (middle pannel) in an in vitro kinase assay as in (B and C).

The expression of the GST fusion protein mutants were checked by coomassie blue

staining (CB).

(G and H) IKKi phosphorylates Ser 220 of Act1 while TBK1 phosphorylates Ser 220 and

Ser 233 of Act1 in the region of 191-330aa. In vitro kinase assays were performed with

the indicated point mutants of GST-hAct1 191-330 as in (F). 4SA represents the four

serine mutant (S201A, S220A, S233A and S256A).

Arrows in (F) to (H) indicate IKKi or TBK1 autophosphorylation. “☆” indicates

phosphotylated Act1.

Figure 7. The IKK-related kinases phosphorylate mouse Act1 at Ser147, Ser209 and  
Ser222.

Flag-tagged mTBK1 (top) or mIKKi (middle) were expressed and immunoprecipitated  
from HEK293T cells, and incubated with recombinant mouse Act1 deletion mutants or  
point mutation mutants of mAct1 region of 121-390aa as indicated. The incorporated  
radioactivity was detected by autoradiography. The recombinant GST fusion proteins of  
Act1 mutants were checked by coomassie blue staining (CB) (bottom). The arrows  
indicate the autophosphorylation bands of IKK-related kinases. “” indicates  
phosphorylated Act1. “*” indicates target protein.

Figure 8. Mouse Act1 is phosphorylated at Ser147, Ser209 and Ser222 upon IL-17  
stimulation.

(A-C) Act1^-/^- MEFs were infected with retrovirus for wild-type Act1 (WT), Act1 single  
point mutants (S147A, S209A and S222A respectively) (A), Act1 double point mutant  
(S147A and S209A) (B) or Act1 triple point mutant (3SA, S147A, S209A and S222A)  
(C). The MEFs were then left untreated or treated with IL-17 (50ng/ml) for 15 or 30 min.  
Lysates were immunoblotted with anti-Act1 and anti-Actin. Arrowheads indicate the  
shifted (phosphorylated) Act1 band.

Figure 9. Act1 phosphorylation by the IKK-related kinases suppresses IL-17  
mediated NF-kB activation.

(A) Mutation of the three Act1 phosphorylation sites enhances IL-17-induced NF-kB.

Act1^-/- MEFs infected with retrovirus encoding wild-type Act1 (WT) or the Act1 mutant

(3SA), were left untreated or treated with IL-17 (50ng/ml) for 15 or 30 min. Lysates were

analyzed by immunoblot with the indicated antibodies. Arrowhead indicates the shifted

(phosphorylated) Act1 band.

(B) Mutation of the three Act1 phosphorylation sites increases IL-17-induced gene

induction. Real-time PCR analysis of Ccl20, Ccl2, Cxcl2 and KC mRNA in Act1^-/- MEFs

infected as in (A) followed by treatment with IL-17 (50ng/ml) for 0, 1h. Graphs show

mean and SEM, n = 3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 (student's t-test).

(C) IL-17-induced association of Act1 with TRAF6 is increased in the DKO MEFs.

Wild-type (WT) and IKKi^-/-TBK1^-/- (DKO) MEF cells were left untreated or treated with

IL-17 (50ng/ml) for 7.5 or 15 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-TRAF6

and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies against TRAF6 and Act1.

(D) Mutation of the three Act1 phosphorylation sites enhances IL-17-induced binding of

Act1 to TRAF6. Act1-/- MEFs were infected with retrovirus encoding wild-type Act1

(WT) or the Act1 triple point mutant (3SA), and then left untreated or treated with

IL-17A (50ng/ml) for 7.5 or 15 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-TRAF6

and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies against TRAF6 and Act1.

Figure 10. TRAF6 but not TRAF3 is critical for Act1 phosphorylation.

(A) Traf3-deficient (Traf3 KO) and wild type (Traf3 WT) MEFs were treated with IL-17  
(50ng/ml) for 0, 15 or 30min. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with antibodies  
against Act1, Actin and TRAF3.  

(B) TRAF6 is required for IL-17-induced Act1 phosphorylation. WT and Traf6⁻/⁻ MEFs  
were stimulated with IL-17 (50ng/ml) for the indicated times. Lysates were analyzed by  
immunoblot with antibodies against Act1, TRAF6, p-IkBα and Actin.  

(C) TRAF6 restores IL-17-induced Act1 phosphorylation in Traf6 deficient MEFs.  
Traf6⁻/⁻ MEFs infected with control virus (EV) or retrovirus for Flag-TRAF6 were  
stimulated with IL-17(50ng/ml) for the indicated times. Lysates were analyzed by  
immunoblot with antibodies against Act1, M2, p-IkBα and Actin.  

(D) TRAF6 E3 ligase activity is required for Act1 phosphorylation. Traf6⁻/⁻ MEFs  
infected with control virus (EV) or retrovirus for Flag-tagged TRAF6 (WT) or its E3  
mutants (Flag-Traf6-ΔRing and Flag-Traf6-C70A respectively), were left untreated or  
treated with IL-17(50ng/ml) for the indicated times. Lysates were analyzed by  
immunoblot with antibodies against Act1, M2, p-IkBα and Actin.  

(E) TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination is not important for Act1 phosphorylation. Traf6⁻/⁻ MEFs  
infected with retrovirus for wild-type Flag-TRAF6 (WT) or its auto-ubiquitination point  
mutant (Flag-TRAF6-K124R), were left untreated or treated with IL-17(50ng/ml) for 15  
or 30min. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with antibodies against Act1, M2 and  
Actin.

822 Figure 11. TRAF6 is essential for IL-17-induced TBK1 activation and its association
823 with Act1.
824 (A) TRAF6 is required for TBK1 activation. HeLa cells transfected with either scrambled
825 (si-NC) or Traf6 siRNA (si-Traf6) oligonucleotides. After 72h, the cells were left
826 untreated or treated with IL-17 (50ng/ml) for the indicated times. Lysates were analyzed
827 by immunoblot with the indicated antibodies.
828 (B) TRAF6 is not essential for IKKi activation. WT and Traf6^-/-^ MEFs infected with
829 retrovirus for Flag-IKKi were stimulated with IL-17(50ng/ml) for the indicated times.
830 Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-M2 and followed by in vitro kinase assay.
831 Whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with the indicated antibodies.
832 (C) Act1 is required for TBK1 activation. HeLa cells transfected with either scrambled
833 (si-NC) or Act1 siRNA (si-Act1) oligonucleotides. After 72h, the cells were left untreated
834 or treated with IL-17 (50ng/ml) for the indicated times. Lysates were analyzed by
835 immunoblot with the indicated antibodies.
836 (D) TRAF6 is critical for IL-17 induced association of Act1 with the IKK-related kinases.
837 WT or Traf6^-/-^ MEFs infected with retrovirus encoding HA-TBK1 were treated with
838 IL-17 (50ng/ml) for 0, 15 or 30min and then lysates were immunoprecipitated with

839 anti-Act1, followed by immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. WCL indicates
840 whole cell lysates.
841 (E) TRAF6 E3 ligase activity is critical for IL-17-induced Act1 association with the
842 IKK-related kinases. Traf6−/− MEFs infected with control virus (EV), or retrovirus
843 encoding Flag-TRAF6 (WT) or its E3 mutants (Flag-Traf6-ΔRing and Flag-Traf6-C70A
844 respectively), were left untreated or treated with IL-17 (50ng/ml) for the indicated times.
845 Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Act1, followed by immunoblot analysis with
846 the indicated antibodies.
847 (F) The dominant negative of TRAF6 severely reduces IL-17-induced Act1 association
848 with the IKK-related kinases in human cells. Human U87-MG cells infected with
849 retroviral control or retrovirus for Flag-TRAF6-ΔRing (the dominant negative) were
850 treated with IL-17 (50ng/ml) for 0, 15 or 30min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with
851 anti-Act1, followed by immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies.
