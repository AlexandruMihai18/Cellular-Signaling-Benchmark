# Aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands in cancer: friend and foe

**Iain A. Murray, Andrew D. Patterson and Gary H. Perdew**

**Abstract** | The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is best known for mediating the toxicity and tumour-promoting properties of the carcinogen 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-$p$-dioxin, commonly referred to as ‘dioxin’. AHR influences the major stages of tumorigenesis — initiation, promotion, progression and metastasis — and physiologically relevant AHR ligands are often formed during disease states or during heightened innate and adaptive immune responses. Interestingly, ligand specificity and affinity vary between rodents and humans. Studies of aggressive tumours and tumour cell lines show increased levels of AHR and constitutive localization of this receptor in the nucleus. This suggests that the AHR is chronically activated in tumours, thus facilitating tumour progression. This Review discusses the role of AHR in tumorigenesis and the potential for therapeutic modulation of its activity in tumours.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a member of the basic helix–loop–helix–PER–ARNT–SIM (bHLH–PAS) subgroup of the bHLH superfamily of transcription factors and is the only member of this family known to be activated by ligands¹. AHR was discovered as the receptor that binds 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-$p$-dioxin (TCDD; also known as dioxin) with high affinity; this receptor is capable of sustained hyperactivation, resulting in a myriad of toxicological outcomes. The half-life of TCDD in humans is approximately 10 years owing to its inability to be metabolized to a polar derivative that can be excreted. These properties contribute to the potency of TCDD as a promoter of liver and skin carcinogenesis in rodents². After heterodimerization with the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT), AHR can induce the transcription of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes that are important in the metabolism and bioactivation of carcinogens, particularly polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (FIG. 1). DNA microarray studies have established that AHR either directly or indirectly regulates a myriad of genes involved in a wide variety of biochemical pathways, including energy metabolism, lipid and cholesterol synthesis, xenobiotic metabolism and various transportation pathways³. AHR-knockout mice have provided insights into the physiological role of AHR and have been useful for exploring the influence of AHR expression on susceptibility to carcinogens. AHR is now known to be involved in various cellular processes, such as the cell cycle, epithelial barrier function, cell migration and immune function.

A high degree of complexity has emerged regarding the role of AHR in cancer, with clear discrepancies in the reported protumorigenic and antitumorigenic activities of AHR signalling in studies using cell culture versus *in vivo* models of malignancy. Furthermore, various classes of AHR ligands and, indeed, ligands within the same class can differentially modulate AHR to influence tumorigenic outcomes. Nevertheless, AHR is a potentially important drug target that can be effectively modulated with different classes of ligands. Here, we focus on what has been established about the activity of AHR using animal models and human tissue, with particular emphasis on the role of AHR in immune surveillance and cancer. An issue that is covered in this Review and that has not received sufficient prior attention is the difference between endogenous ligand specificity for human versus mouse AHR and how this may affect cancer research (BOX 1). In addition, a wide variety of tumour types exhibit both high levels of AHR expression relative to the parent cell type (BOX 2) and significant constitutive receptor activity, so AHR antagonists could potentially be used in cancer treatment.

## Mechanisms of AHR activation

**AHR agonists.** Numerous chemicals exhibit high-affinity binding to AHR, altering its activity in a ligand-dependent manner and thus rendering this receptor an attractive small-molecule target (TABLE 1). For many years, the focus was on the identification of xenobiotics that exhibit strong agonist activity, such as

Figure 1 | Agonist-mediated activation of AHR. The unliganded aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) resides in the cytoplasm of a cell, forming a complex with a heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) dimer and the co-chaperone protein X-associated protein 2 (XAP2). AHR contains nuclear localization signal and nuclear export signal sequences, and undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. On binding an agonist, the AHR complex translocates to the nucleus and AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) mediates HSP90 displacement, leading to AHR–ARNT heterodimer formation. This heterodimer is capable of binding to a dioxin-responsive element (DRE) with the sequence 5′-T/G/TCGTGA/CG/TA/T-3′. Both AHR and ARNT can recruit co-activators, leading to the transcription of a wide variety of genes. The AHR target gene cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) is almost totally dependent on AHR activity for expression and is highly induced by AHR activation through multiple DREs. CYP1A1 metabolizes a number of pro-carcinogens, such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), to intermediates that can react with DNA to form adducts, resulting in mutagenesis. RNA Pol II, RNA polymerase II.

persistent planar halogenated polycyclic hydrocarbons (for example, many dioxins, dibenzofurans and biphenyls) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (for example, benzo[a]pyrene and benzanthracene). More recently, a wide variety of lower-affinity agonists have been identified from diverse sources. Through the use of various assay systems that detect AHR transcriptional activity, many commercial and consumer products, fruits, vegetables and spices have been shown to have AHR activation potential, which could substantially contribute to our total AHR ligand exposure levels. However, the identity of specific compounds with AHR activity was not established in these studies. Other research has revealed several drugs that exhibit off-target activity through binding to AHR (TABLE 1). In addition, a number of reports have identified specific dietary constituents that are AHR ligands. For example, certain flavonoids (such as quercetin, apigenin and kaempferol) exhibit AHR agonist or antagonist activity in a cell-line-specific manner. Moreover, cruciferous vegetables contain significant amounts of indole glucosinolates that, on consumption, are degraded to indole-3-carbinol. This compound then undergoes condensation reactions in the acidic environment of the stomach, creating several products that are capable of activating AHR, with the compound of highest affinity for AHR being indolo[3,2b]carbazole.

Barrier function
The integrity of a protective epithelial layer that serves as a barrier and allows selective absorption.

Antagonists
In the context of this Review, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands that inhibit canonical dioxin-responsive element (DRE)-mediated and non-DRE-mediated AHR activity.

The presence of AHR ligands at the site of epithelial barriers could indicate that AHR has a role in the response to microflora. Metabolism of tryptophan by bacteria in the intestinal tract leads to the formation of AHR ligands such as indole, indole-3-acetate and indole-3-aldehyde. A chemical library derived from a probiotic bacterium was screened for molecules that activate AHR, and the compound 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid was identified as an AHR agonist. Specific strains of yeast (for example, Malassezia species) isolated from patients with certain skin diseases are capable of synthesizing several potent AHR ligands, including indirubin, indolo[3,2b]carbazole and malassezin. It is possible that the host responds to the presence of these chemicals by mediating AHR activation, thus enhancing barrier function, although these effects are likely to be tissue and context dependent. Consistent with this concept is the observation that coal tar, a rich source of AHR ligands, is capable of enhancing skin barrier function in an AHR-dependent manner. Humans have substantial exposure to AHR ligands from various sources, and whether these exposure levels could lead to enhanced tumorigenesis warrants further investigation. For example, one question that should be addressed is whether AHR ligand concentrations are increased in patients with cancer as the disease progresses.

Ligand-independent activation. Another aspect of AHR behaviour to consider is the possibility that there is genuine ligand-independent activation. In support of this concept is the apparent ability of increased levels of cyclic AMP to activate AHR¹⁶. Furthermore, it is possible that in cells that have relatively high AHR levels, such as many tumour cell lines, AHR undergoes dynamic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, which could lead to AHR and ARNT heterodimerization in the absence of ligand¹⁷. Support for this concept can be found by comparing the level of retained nuclear AHR in a human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell line, NH30, with that in normal human keratinocytes¹⁸. However, the possibility that AHR ligands are present in these cells cannot be excluded. Shear stress in endothelial cells can also lead to AHR activation, although the mechanism of activation is not known¹⁹,²⁰. Co-expression ARNT and a mutant AHR (AHR-A375I) that is unable to bind ligands increased

AHR-mediated transcriptional activity, suggesting that AHR can potentially heterodimerize with ARNT in the absence of ligands, although the heterodimerization potential in this case seems to be poor²¹.

### AHR agonist-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis

TCDD is considered as both a complete epigenetic carcinogen and a potent tumour promoter through sustained activation of AHR²²,²³. Many of the studies that led to these conclusions have focused on the role of AHR in liver cancer in rodents. Recent progress has been made in determining the mechanisms of liver tumour promotion with the recognition of inflammatory signalling as a major component of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)²⁴. Using a two-stage carcinogenesis model, it has been shown that the receptors for tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα), TNFβ (also known as LTα), interleukin-1α (IL-1A) and IL-1β have a major role in the ability of the carcinogen diethylnitrosamine to

**Box 1 | Human AHR exhibits differential activity relative to rodent AHR: an emerging issue**

In vivo rodent studies have pointed to a role for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in tumorigenesis. However, there are several important structural differences between human and mouse AHR that lead to changes in AHR function (see the figure). The first difference to be observed was a decrease in the stability of the human AHR–heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) interaction compared with the mouse AHR–HSP90 interaction¹⁴¹. An amino acid sequence comparison between mouse and human AHR revealed ~85% sequence homology within the amino-terminal half of the receptor, whereas the carboxy-terminal half exhibits much lower sequence homology, with most of the non-conserved changes occurring in the transactivation domain. Studies using primary hepatocytes from humans, mice and humanized mice have revealed that the human and mouse AHR differentially mediate gene expression in hepatocytes¹⁴²⁻¹⁴⁴. One report has shown that the transactivation domain of human AHR differs from mouse AHR in terms of its ability to interact with co-activator motifs¹⁴⁵. These studies suggest that there are significant species-specific differences in gene transactivation selectivity and potential. Perhaps the most dramatic difference between human and mouse AHR is the distinct ligand selectivity. Mouse AHR binds 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) with a tenfold higher affinity than human AHR owing to the difference in a single amino acid residue in the middle of the ligand-binding pocket¹⁴⁶. Conversely, human AHR binds endogenous indolic derivatives such as indirubin and indoxyl sulphate with much higher affinity than mouse AHR³⁸,¹⁴⁷. This in turn suggests that human AHR could differ in its ‘constitutive’ activation status in a tumour, which indicates that studies in mice might underestimate the role of AHR in human tumorigenesis.

Box 2 | AHR expression during tumorigenesis

The presence of high-affinity aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands can mediate substantial AHR transcriptional activity even in the presence of modest levels of AHR expression. However, this situation generally only exists in experimental exposure studies. Under circumstances in which low-affinity ligands are produced locally, the relative expression of AHR is likely to be a determining factor. Therefore, the level of AHR expression is an important parameter to consider in tumour development under physiological conditions. The AHR is expressed in most tissues (except skeletal muscle) and expression levels vary widely, with the highest levels observed in the liver, lungs, spleen and kidneys. Within a given tissue, generally the greatest level of expression is seen in cells of epithelial origin. Immunohistochemical analysis of breast, prostate, gastric, small cell lung and liver tumours exhibit increased levels of AHR expression relative to surrounding tissue ${ }^{63,148-152}$. One possible explanation for the enhanced level of expression in human tumours is the ability of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) to enhance AHR expression, which correlates with inflammatory status ${ }^{153,154}$. A specific functional response element for the NF-$\kappa$B heterodimer RELA–p50 was identified in the proximal promoter of the human AHR gene ${ }^{154}$. Another aspect to address is whether the expressed AHR is actually transcriptionally active. One indirect approach is to examine cytoplasmic versus nuclear localization using immunohistochemical visualization of tissue sections. Grading of prostate tissue sections revealed that increased nuclear localization of AHR correlated positively with the number of poorly differentiated cells ${ }^{149}$. Increased levels of nuclear AHR were also associated with poor prognosis for patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma ${ }^{151}$. By contrast, the levels of AHR in breast cancer were inversely correlated with the histological grade of the tumour ${ }^{148}$. This might be due to the ability of AHR to antagonize oestrogen receptor activity. Another approach to examine the role of AHR activity in human tumour samples is to determine the level of expression of an AHR target gene (for example, cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1)). For example, a comparison of CYP1B1 expression levels with survival rates of patients with glioma revealed that increased CYP1B1 expression correlated with lower patient survival ${ }^{35}$. Thus, recent studies support the hypothesis that increased AHR expression or activity correlates with the promotion of late-stage tumorigenesis in most human tumours that have been examined, and such expression might confer a selective advantage for tumour cells.

has been studied in established cell lines and only to a limited extent in primary cell culture or *in vivo*. Early in the tumorigenesis process, a complex, multicellular, inflammatory microenvironment develops. In this situation, the level of AHR expression and activity probably resembles that of the tissue of origin, and it is not known whether the AHR ligands present are produced locally or systemically. However, environmental ligands such as halogenated planar polycyclic hydrocarbons, as well as dietary ligands (described above), could facilitate a substantial level of activation through systemic circulation. Indeed, AHR ligands have been detected in serum from cancer-free individuals through the use of reporter assay systems ${ }^{28,29}$. Several indole-derived potent human AHR ligands — indirubin, indigo and metabolites of 6-formylindolo[3,2$b$]carbazole — have been identified in human urine ${ }^{30,31}$. Whether these compounds are dietary, generated by the host or derived from bacterial metabolism has not been firmly established. Nevertheless, these compounds seem to add to the number of AHR agonists found in healthy humans (TABLE 1).

In a complex inflammatory microenvironment comprised of a number of cell types, endogenous ligands seem to be produced that could set up autocrine or paracrine pathways, leading to sustained AHR activation (FIG. 2). Perhaps the most important are the tryptophan dioxygenase tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) pathways, which produce kynurenine — a relatively weak AHR ligand — from tryptophan ${ }^{32}$. In the absence of a disease state such as cancer, TDO2 is predominantly expressed in the liver and is the major degradation pathway that controls circulating tryptophan levels, whereas IDO1 is expressed in several immune cell types, particularly in an inflammatory environment. TDO2 and/or IDO1 can be expressed in various tumours, leading to substantial production of kynurenine ${ }^{33}$. Immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, within the tumour microenvironment are likely to have increased levels of IDO1, contributing to the local depletion of tryptophan, along with increased tryptophan metabolites (AHR ligands), which contribute to increased formation of regulatory T ($\mathrm{T}_{\text {Reg }}$) cells and to immune tolerance ${ }^{34}$. There is a positive correlation between the expression of TDO2 and the AHR-regulated gene CYP1B1 in human glioblastoma tissues ${ }^{35}$. In addition, glioma cell lines can produce high levels of kynurenine that are capable of activating AHR ${ }^{35}$. These studies also demonstrated that increased CYP1B1 mRNA expression positively correlated with poor survival in patients with glioblastomas. A survey of glioma cell lines revealed that many are capable of producing kynurenine up to a concentration of $60 \mu \mathrm{M}$ in cell culture ${ }^{35}$. Whether the level of AHR activity observed in these tumours is predominantly due to kynurenine or the presence of other AHR ligands was not established. Indeed, other products of the IDO1 degradation pathway, such as kynurenic acid and xanthurenic acid, are more potent AHR ligands than kynurenine ${ }^{36}$. In fact, kynurenic acid levels have been observed to positively correlate with the size of pancreatic adenocarcinomas ${ }^{37}$. Studies of xenograft models of a glioma cell line lacking AHR expression indicated that

mediate tumour incidence in mice ${ }^{25}$. Furthermore, the absence of these receptors greatly attenuated the ability of TCDD to promote the number and size of liver tumours. One possible explanation for these results is the key role that IL-6 signalling has in the malignant progression of HCC ${ }^{26}$. Indeed, AHR can synergistically induce $I l 6$ in the presence of an inflammatory signal through both TCDD and nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) response elements in the $I l 6$ promoter ${ }^{27}$. These observations would support testing whether TCDD can promote carcinogenesis in a $I l 6$-null mice. Thus, the disruption of AHR activation by the pool of endogenous and exogenous AHR agonists would seem to be a logical goal when considering AHR as a therapeutic target.

### Endogenous AHR ligands in tumorigenesis

Perhaps one of the most fundamental questions concerning the role of AHR in carcinogenesis is whether endogenous ligands can mediate sufficient receptor activity to influence tumour progression. A number of studies have examined the role of AHR in tumorigenesis, and a complex story has emerged with reports that detail the ability of AHR activation to enhance or repress tumorigenesis. The question of whether AHR ligands are present in the tumour microenvironment needs to be addressed, as well as how the ligand type (for example, endogenous or exogenous) influences AHR activity. Indeed, the ability of endogenous ligands to modulate AHR activity

**Figure 2 | AHR activity within the tumour microenvironment.** Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activity is increased in tumours compared with surrounding non-malignant and stromal cells, suggesting that AHR might influence tumour development. The mechanisms that govern enhanced tumour-associated AHR expression are unclear. However, increased AHR expression is likely to increase basal AHR activity within tumours, especially given the systemic omnipresence of AHR agonist ligands derived from xenobiotic, dietary and microbial sources. Indeed, malignant tissue exhibits enhanced nuclear localization of AHR together with increased expression of the prototypical AHR target gene cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), which is indicative of higher AHR transcriptional activity. The presence of immune cells (for example, antigen-presenting cells (APCs)) within the tumour microenvironment, in conjunction with malignant cells, often coincides with enhanced expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2). IDO1 and TDO2 generate agonistic AHR ligands from tryptophan within the tumour microenvironment, thus adding to the AHR activation potential within tumours. The consequences of enhanced AHR expression and activities arising from systemic and tumour-derived AHR agonists have not been thoroughly investigated; however, such activation is likely to promote tumour growth. AHR activation and inflammatory cytokine signalling, a common feature of tumours, results in synergistic induction of pro-inflammatory factors, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), exacerbating inflammation while simultaneously promoting the differentiation of immune-suppressive regulatory T (T<sub>Reg</sub>) cells through increased expression of IL-10, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). Systemic and tumour-localized generation of AHR ligands and heightened AHR expression and activity might establish a pro-inflammatory yet immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment, favouring tumour survival and escape from immune surveillance, and resulting in tumour progression. Ac, acetylation; ARNT, AHR nuclear translocator; HDAC, histone deacetylase.

cell lines are usually derived from different tissues and cultured under optimal conditions that lack the complex milieu of immune, stromal and tumour-associated signalling that occurs with *in vivo* malignancy. Nonetheless, it is clear from numerous lines of evidence that AHR does affect tumour cell proliferation through diverse and contradictory mechanisms, thus making AHR a theoretical target for suppression of tumour growth.

Several growth factors are known to be important in tumour cell proliferation, and increased expression levels are associated with a range of cancers. Importantly, epiregulin and amphiregulin, fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), osteopontin and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) all exhibit a degree of AHR dependency with regard to their expression. In fact, the promoters of many of these genes (for example, epiregulin) contain AHR DNA response elements and exhibit enhanced expression following exposure to AHR agonists. As potent mitogens, enhanced expression of these

factors is likely to contribute to tumour cell proliferation. Indeed, these factors are present at increased levels within tumours of different origins but, thus far, it has not been established whether they can be attributed to increased AHR activity, although increased AHR expression is often observed in tumours (BOX 2); this, combined with the omnipresence of AHR agonists (environmental, dietary, endogenous and tumour-derived), renders some level of AHR involvement likely. Furthermore, the transcription of the genes encoding these mitogens increases in response to tumour-associated inflammatory stimuli (for example, IL-6 and IL-1β) owing to the presence of the NF-κB response element in their promoters; in cell culture models, inflammatory stimuli and AHR agonists synergistically induce these genes. These effects of AHR on growth factor signalling might account for the tumour-promoting activity of TCDD that is observed in rodents. In addition to modulating the expression of upstream mitogenic factors,

AHR–oestrogen receptor crosstalk and cancer. The endocrine-disrupting effects of compounds subsequently identified as AHR ligands point to AHR as a modulator of hormone receptor function. Subsequent studies have revealed that both the androgen receptor (AR) and the oestrogen receptor (ER) are particularly sensitive targets of AHR inhibition in a ligand-dependent manner<sup>60</sup>. Consequently, there has been an extensive analysis of the role of AHR in oestrogen-dependent breast cancer. A complex picture is emerging with numerous mechanisms proposed to account for the generally anti-oestrogenic nature of AHR in breast and other cancers<sup>61-63</sup>. For example, AHR agonists stimulate CYP1A1- and CYP1B1-mediated oestrogen depletion<sup>64</sup>. Proteasomal degradation of ER is enhanced by AHR acting as a component of the ubiquitin ligase complex. However, its exact role in these complexes has not been established<sup>65,66</sup>. In addition, oestrogen-dependent transcription of numerous genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis is suppressed in an AHR-dependent fashion<sup>67</sup>. These mechanisms of AHR activity are largely mediated through direct interaction with ER, resulting in mutual inhibition of DNA binding and disruption of co-activator or repressor recruitment<sup>65,68,69</sup>. These suppressive mechanisms are believed to account for some of the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of AHR agonists on oestrogen-dependent tumour growth models.

Extrinsic factors that modulate AHR activity in tumours. An important consideration concerning AHR expression in tumour cells is that increased expression may or may not correlate with increased AHR activity, such that any AHR-mediated response is likely to be dictated by numerous factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic to AHR signalling. Localized generation and availability of AHR ligands will influence AHR activity at the resolution of a single cell, but the combination of AHR and its ligands may not permit AHR activity in the context of competing signals. For example, ER status in breast cancer is likely to influence AHR activity<sup>70,71</sup>. As noted above, both receptors exhibit mutual antagonism; indeed, this is the basis for the extensive studies purporting the beneficial aspects of AHR agonists in limiting the proliferative effects of the ER in models of hormone-dependent breast cancer<sup>69,72</sup>. Therefore, AHR activity in ER-positive breast cancer cells is likely to differ from that in ER-negative cells. Indeed, the ability of AHR to crosstalk with numerous signalling components introduces a confounding level of complexity when trying to assess the responsiveness of AHR in any given tumour cell. Additional factors may limit AHR responsiveness, such as the metabolic and transporter activities of tumour cells, which may limit exposure to AHR ligands. AHR activity may also vary within different tumour cells in a given tumour owing to nutrient availability, cell cycle status, redox status, hypoxia, cell–cell contact or cytokine levels, all of which are reported to influence AHR-mediated signalling<sup>73-76</sup>. Thus, it seems likely that the response of AHR to ligands in cancer is probably highly contextual, which may account for the dichotomous observations that AHR exhibits both

Figure 3 | Proposed mechanisms of cell cycle modulation by AHR. Multiple mechanisms are proposed to account for the proliferative and anti-proliferative action of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonists in tumour cells in vitro. **a** | AHR acts as direct transcriptional activator of genes encoding mitogenic growth factors—for example, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epiregulin, amphiregulin and fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9)—by binding to AHR response elements within their promoters. As potent mitogens, these growth factors contribute to tumour proliferation by stimulating entry into M phase, and they might account for AHR agonist-mediated tumour-cell proliferation. **b** | Agonist-activated AHR binds to the promoter of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B), which encodes p27, and thus enhances p27 expression<sup>158,159</sup>. Increased levels of p27 limit the phosphorylation of RB, thus restricting the E2F-dependent expression of genes required for S phase, leading to G1 arrest. **c** | Association of AHR with non-phosphorylated RB in an agonist-dependent manner attenuates both phosphorylation of RB and liberation of E2F, resulting in G1 arrest and inhibition of proliferation<sup>160</sup>. **d** | Agonist activation of AHR promotes its association with β-catenin and stimulation of a recently discovered ubiquitin ligase function of AHR<sup>44,66</sup>. Ubiquitylation of β-catenin in an AHR-dependent fashion promotes proteasomal degradation of β-catenin, thus restricting the expression of factors required for cell cycle-dependent gene expression and proliferation. **e** | In the absence of ligand, AHR forms a complex with cyclin D and cyclin-dependent kinases 4 (CDK4); this suppresses phosphorylation of RB, prompting G1 arrest by limiting E2F-mediated S phase progression<sup>161</sup>. Exposure to AHR agonist favours the dissociation of the AHR–cyclin D–CDK complex to permit cell cycle progression and tumour-cell proliferation. These AHR-mediated mechanisms, which were determined experimentally using cell culture models, might exert opposing effects upon cell cycle progression. The extent to which these mechanisms govern cell cycle progression within an in vivo tumour remains to be established. The effect of AHR is likely to be temporally dependent on the position of the cell cycle when encountering an AHR agonist: for example, the effect might depend on whether RB is hyperphosphorylated before AHR is activated by an agonist. Given the probable asynchronous nature of cell division within a tumour, such apparently contradictory (stimulatory and inhibitory) mechanisms might occur simultaneously within different cells of an in vivo tumour.

protumorigenic and antitumorigenic activities. Such contextual complexity is inherently difficult to dissect and cannot be effectively addressed with *in vitro* cell culture studies. Even *in vivo* models examining the role of AHR in cancer are highly likely to impart model-dependent contextual bias.

**Metastasis.** The signalling events that initiate the metastatic progression of tumours have yet to be fully elucidated, but increasing evidence points to a role for AHR in the modulation of cell adhesion and migratory potential<sup>16</sup> (FIG. 4). Studies have identified increased transient AHR nuclear translocation and activity during loss of cell–cell contact through a mechanism involving Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation<sup>77,78</sup>, as well as augmented migration in multiple cell culture models<sup>79,80</sup>. Thus, AHR activation, whether arising from a loss of cell adhesion or agonist stimulation, may promote metastasis. A number of pro-migratory factors seem to be altered by AHR transcriptional activity, including adhesion components<sup>81</sup>, proteases<sup>80</sup>, cytokines<sup>82</sup>, signal transduction adaptors<sup>83,84</sup> and transcription factors<sup>85,86</sup>. By contrast, expression of CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), which can promote metastasis, is downregulated by AHR agonist-mediated activity in breast cancer cells, suggesting an anti-metastatic effect of AHR activation<sup>87,88</sup>. *In vivo* studies are needed to take into account the effects of AHR activation on metastatic potential within the complex tumour microenvironment.

**AHR and innate immunity.** The central role of innate immune signalling in the development and progression of tumorigenesis is becoming increasingly apparent. Multiple cell types within the tumour contribute to the formation of an anti-apoptotic, and increased angiogenic, invasive and metastatic phenotype<sup>89</sup>. Within the tumour microenvironment, the neoplastic, immune and stromal cells can all participate in the expression of cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory mediators, leading to positive paracrine feedback loops, which ultimately result in sustained or chronic inflammation. Recent reviews detail the altered expression of a wide variety of inflammatory signalling molecules after AHR ligand exposure<sup>62,90,91</sup>. In *Ahr*<sup>−/−</sup> mice, a challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to a heightened induction of a number of cytokines, suggesting that the AHR might have a role in constitutively attenuating inflammation<sup>92</sup>. Whether AHR activation regulates cytokine and chemokine expression directly or indirectly is important to consider when assessing the role of AHR in inflammation. Evidence for direct transcriptional regulation of cytokines by AHR is somewhat limited but has been established for the genes encoding IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-21 through promoter analysis<sup>27,93,94</sup>. Treatment of MCF7 or ECL1 cancer cell lines with an AHR ligand in the presence of an inflammatory signal synergistically induces IL-6 (REF. 95). The mechanism of this synergism is driven by AHR–ARNT occupancy of dioxin-responsive elements (DREs) ~3 kB upstream from the transcriptional start site, which in turn mediates displacement of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) from the *IL6* promoter and subsequent acetylation of NF-κB<sup>27</sup> (FIG. 4). This mode of regulation was also observed in HNSCC lines<sup>82</sup>. The proximal promoters of a number of cytokine and chemokine genes have DREs, raising the possibility that the AHR directly regulates a much larger subset of genes, especially in combination with the activation of a transcription factor (or multiple factors; for example, NF-κB) associated with inflammation<sup>96</sup>. Further support for synergistic regulation of cytokine and chemokine expression — for example, *Il6*, *Il10*, *Il22* or *Cxcl3* (which encodes CXC-chemokine ligand 3) — was observed through AHR activation in the presence of LPS in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells<sup>97</sup>. Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (*PTGS2*; also known as *COX2*) gene expression is also directly regulated by activation of both NF-κB and AHR in various cell types<sup>98,99</sup>. The logic for AHR mediating inflammation in this manner is probably based on the role of the AHR in barrier function and as a sensor for ligands generated by microflora or the host at the site of an infection. Furthermore, in an inflammatory environment such as a carcinoma of epithelial origin, AHR is likely to participate directly in the regulation of several growth factors, consistent with observations in a barrier tissue injury<sup>49</sup>. Along this line of reasoning, the inflammatory microenvironment within a tumour of epithelial origin is likely to alter the expression of a broad repertoire of genes by AHR through combinatorial gene regulation.

The AHR seems to regulate innate inflammatory signalling not only through binding to its cognate response element in association with ARNT but also through direct binding to RELA (also known as p65) and RELB, which are members of the NF-κB family of transcription factors<sup>100,101</sup>. Interaction of AHR with RELA has been shown to either repress or enhance RELA transcriptional activity in a context-specific manner<sup>102</sup>. AHR has been shown to bind to RELB as well, and this complex can interact with a unique response element within the promoter of a number of RELB target genes<sup>101,103</sup>. AHR–RELB complexes have also been shown to bind to DREs, further increasing the complexity of target genes influenced by this heterodimer. In addition, interaction of RELB and AHR in the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-436 and MCF7 seems to mediate IL-8 expression<sup>104</sup>. These studies further support the concept that AHR activation contributes to inflammatory signalling in tumours through multiple mechanisms.

**AHR and adaptive immunity.** Historically, the importance of adaptive immunity and tumour immune surveillance in tumorigenesis has been controversial. More recent studies have firmly established that tumours escape immune surveillance through deletion and inactivation of self-reactive lymphocytes and that this is an important early event in tumour development<sup>105–107</sup>. Locally induced type 1 regulatory T cells (*T*<sub>R</sub>1) and thymus-derived natural *T*<sub>Reg</sub> cells are believed to have a central role in mediating a suppressed immune environment within a tumour. AHR has been shown to be an important regulator of T cell differentiation,

Figure 4 | Proposed role of AHR in tumour metastasis. The dual effect of increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) expression and localized AHR agonist generation by tumour cells and tumour-associated immune cells increases AHR activity, leading to the initiation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition and facilitating tumour cell migration, invasiveness and metastasis. Heightened AHR activity promotes the expression of SLUG (also known as zinc finger protein SNAI2), which then inhibits E-cadherin expression, thus decreasing cell adhesion. The AHR-dependent expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and intracellular signalling factors (such as VAV3) that promote cytoskeletal rearrangement renders tumour cells increasingly motile<sup>84</sup>. The presence of tumour-associated inflammatory cytokine signalling results in a self-sustaining synergistic loop in combination with AHR activation, which enhances cell motility<sup>18</sup>. Increased AHR-dependent expression of genes encoding growth and pro-angiogenic factors provides an escape route for motile tumour cells. The generation of AHR agonists by tumour-associated immune cells facilitates the differentiation of immune-suppressive regulatory T (T<sub>Reg</sub>) cells, which dampens the immune response to isolated motile tumour cells, thus allowing metastasis and the establishment of distant secondary tumours.

with AHR levels being markedly induced during this process<sup>94,108,109</sup>. AHR functions in concert with the transcription factor MAF to enhance *Il10* and *Il21* expression, leading to the formation of T<sub>R</sub> cells. TCDD can also induce T<sub>Reg</sub> cell production, suggesting that the presence of endogenous AHR ligands enhances T<sub>Reg</sub> cell production in the tumour microenvironment<sup>110</sup>. However, the ability of AHR to influence chronic disease progression from the perspective of adaptive immunity has mostly been examined in autoimmune disease models. AHR was initially shown to favour the formation of T<sub>Reg</sub> cells following treatment with TCDD<sup>111</sup>. TCDD has been shown to attenuate autoimmune type 1 diabetes in a non-obese diabetic mouse model, as well as to reduce the effect of colitis in mice; in both cases, TCDD administration correlated with the enhanced production of T<sub>Reg</sub> cells<sup>112–114</sup>. The AHR can induce both T<sub>Reg</sub> cells and T helper 17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) cells,

with TCDD favouring the production of T<sub>Reg</sub> cells concomitant with a decrease in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) progression<sup>115</sup>. By contrast, the AHR agonist 6-formylindolo[3,2*b*]carbazole favours T<sub>H</sub>17 cell production and a subsequent increase in the severity of EAE. This suggests that the AHR agonist used in a given study could influence the outcome in an autoimmune disease model. A new class of AHR ligands, benzimidazoisquinolines, has been identified that is capable of mediating enhanced T<sub>Reg</sub> cell production in a mouse graft-versus-host autoimmune model, leading to the suppression of clinical symptoms<sup>116</sup>. This study supports the concept that an AHR agonist could be developed that would be useful in organ transplants (for example, bone marrow transplants) if the potential for possible long-term adverse effects of agonist treatment are resolved. One possible contributor to the *in vivo* production of T<sub>Reg</sub> cells is AHR-mediated induction

of IDO1 and kynurenine³². In addition, naringenin (a dietary flavonoid that is an AHR agonist) is also capable of inducing T<sub>Reg</sub> cell production¹¹⁷. These results suggest that AHR is likely to participate in the regulation of T<sub>Reg</sub> cell differentiation as a result of the presence of endogenous, exogenous and dietary ligands. Considering the studies examining the effects of AHR ligands on the suppression of autoimmunity, it is reasonable to hypothesize that activity linked to AHR in the tumour microenvironment, such as the increased production of T<sub>Reg</sub> cells, may in part explain the tumour-promoting properties of TCDD.

### Potential therapeutic manipulation of AHR

#### Antagonism of AHR activity.
AHR antagonists are increasingly being examined as possible therapeutic agents. Perhaps the first AHR antagonist described was a derivative of TCDD, 1-amino-3,7,8-trichlorodibenzo-*p*-dioxin¹¹⁸. Historically, the most-used AHR antagonist is α-naphthoflavone, which actually exhibits weak agonist activity at high concentrations¹¹⁹,¹²⁰. Other flavone-based antagonists that have been described include 3′methoxy-4′nitroflavone and 6,2′,4′-trimethoxyflavone, with the latter exhibiting no agonist activity¹²¹,¹²². Interestingly, some of the beneficial activity of resveratrol has been attributed to its antagonism of AHR¹²³. More recently, higher-affinity AHR antagonists have been identified that seem to have no agonist potential¹²⁴–¹²⁶. For example, the compound CH-223191 has been successfully used in rodents¹²⁷. However, it fails to block the agonist activity of β-naphthoflavone, highlighting the possibility that a given AHR antagonist may not block all agonist activity in a given setting¹²⁸. A high-affinity AHR antagonist, StemReginin 1, was identified by a high-throughput screen for compounds that enhance the expansion of haematopoietic stem cells *ex vivo*¹²⁵. Interestingly, this compound has much higher affinity for human AHR versus mouse AHR, illustrating the difference in ligand specificity between species (BOX 1). GNF351 is an AHR antagonist that was generated during medicinal chemistry optimization of StemReginin 1 (REF. 126). GNF351 does not exhibit any agonist activity and efficiently inhibits both human and mouse AHR. These recently identified AHR antagonists should serve as useful pharmacological tools to study the role of AHR in tumorigenesis.

#### SAHRMs and the modulation of tumorigenesis.
Numerous studies have investigated the role of AHR ligand treatment in cultured tumour cells, examining specific end points. However, there are far fewer studies that have tested the effect of various functionally distinct AHR ligand classes on tumorigenesis, especially from a therapeutic standpoint *in vivo*. The laboratory of Stephen Safe has pioneered the development of SAHRMs that show therapeutic potential⁶³. Safe’s work has focused on the development of weak AHR agonists that would not exhibit the toxicity of a full agonist, such as TCDD, using CYP1A1 induction as a measure of transcriptional activity. In the presence of a full agonist, these compounds would exhibit AHR antagonistic activity. The SAHRM that has been used most often in *in vivo* studies is 6-methyl-1,3,8-trichlorodibenzop-dioxin (MCDF), which has moderate affinity for AHR but only exhibits weak agonist activity¹³⁶. However, this weak agonist is still able to mediate anti-oestrogenic activity and repress the development of rat mammary tumours after exposure to a carcinogen¹³⁷,¹³⁸. MCDF also inhibited the growth of ER-negative breast cancer cells in a xenograft mouse model and lung metastasis in tail vein injection assays¹³⁹,¹⁴⁰. These studies indicate that there is considerable potential for the use of SAHRMs as cancer treatments.

### Concluding remarks
The study of the effects of AHR agonists together with the development of potent antagonists and SAHRMs or weak agonists has highlighted many important, if conflicting and counterintuitive, aspects of the role of AHR in tumorigenesis. Evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of AHR ligands with regard to the suppression of tumorigenic outcomes awaits the identification and development of specific high-affinity AHR ligands that exhibit improved absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion profiles, followed by their use in multiple *in vivo* models of cancer. The differences between mouse and human AHR activities suggest that ‘humanized’ AHR *in vivo* models would be

**Weak agonist**
In the context of this Review, this refers to an aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand that displays partial agonist activity, eliciting a sub-maximal dioxin-responsive element-mediated transcriptional response. In addition, in the presence of a strong agonist, a weak agonist will exhibit antagonist activity.

**Selective AHR modulators (SAHRMs).**
Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands that display functional selectivity, exhibiting negligible dioxin-responsive element (DRE)-mediated transcriptional responses while maximally stimulating non-DRE mediated AHR activity.

**Full agonist**
In the context of this Review, an aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand that maximally elicits canonical dioxin-responsive element-mediated transcriptional responses.

**Development of selective AHR modulators.**
Selective nuclear receptor ligands were first described for the ER (selective ER modulators; SERMs). These compounds (for example, tamoxifen and raloxifene) have been shown to alter the range of genes that are activated by the ligand–ER complex through differential co-activator and co-repressor recruitment¹²⁹. This mechanism is based on the concept that the activation function 2 transactivation domain in the ER is localized near the ligand-binding domain and SERMs alter the co-activator recruitment interface. The ligand binding and transactivation domains of AHR seem to be distinct, and it is not clear whether different ligands can mediate differential
the preferred approach for future studies. Additionally, given the contradictory observations that AHR is both pro-tumorigenic and a tumour suppressor, an efficacious AHR ligand might not fulfil a ‘one-size-fits-all’ role for treating different types of cancer. Indeed, even within a single model, an AHR ligand can display temporal effectiveness, perhaps being beneficial in a chemopreventive regime but deleterious if a tumour becomes established, or vice versa. AHR agonists seem to be effective at attenuating cell proliferation and migration in numerous *in vitro* settings and limited *in vivo* models. However, their therapeutic application in humans has yet to be examined and is likely to be tainted by the established roles of AHR activation in biotransformation, mutagenesis, tumour promotion and immune suppression. Evidently, the multitude of activities elicited by agonists cannot be attributed entirely to direct AHR–ARNT heterodimer- and DRE-mediated transcription, and might reflect the ability of agonists to induce selective AHR activity. Continued examination of these agonist-mediated effects will be informative in the development of potent SAHRMs that can harness and specifically target the beneficial

selective component of agonists without the associated toxicities. With the recent development of potent AHR antagonists, it will be important to test their effects on tumorigenesis and, perhaps most importantly, as a treatment for existing tumours. Indeed, the fact that antagonists and agonists are both capable of inhibiting tumour cell phenotypes *in vitro* suggests that they work through distinctly different mechanisms yet yield the same end result. Considering the emerging role of AHR in immune tolerance, testing of AHR antagonists as an adjunct to immunotherapy seems to be warranted. The role of endogenous ligands, in particular those produced in the gut and the tumour microenvironment, needs to be explored in terms of whether they participate in tumour progression in various tumour types. The abundance of evidence demonstrating the importance of AHR in dictating tumorigenic outcomes suggests that therapeutic manipulation of AHR in human cancer is on the horizon. Whether this is through the use of agonists, antagonists or SAHRMs will be dictated by data obtained from more extensive *in vivo* studies using these different classes of AHR ligands as treatments for existing tumours.
