## Abstract

The induction of IL-12 from dendritic cells (DCs) is thought to be a critical step in the initiation of IFN-γ-dependent cell-mediated immunity to many intracellular pathogens. We have studied this response using an in vivo model in which IL-12 production by splenic CD8α⁺ DCs is followed after systemic injection of a soluble extract (STAg) of the protozoan parasite *Toxoplasma gondii*. Our findings indicate that G-protein-coupled signaling through the chemokine receptor CCR5 plays a major role in the induction of IL-12 from these cells and that downregulation of CCR5 function through endogenously produced lipoxin explains the loss of responsiveness (paralysis) seen upon STAg reinjection. Recent data on the inductive and regulatory pathways involved and their role in governing host resistance to parasite infection in vivo will be discussed. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

## 1. Introduction

*Toxoplasma gondii* is an apicomplexan protozoan that is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis. The definitive host for this pathogen is the cat (*Felis domesticus*), which acquires the parasite after ingestion of infected prey. Humans or other mammals become infected by the accidental ingestion of cysts either excreted by cats or present in contaminated meat. Once inside the host, the rapid replicating tachyzoite forms of the parasite proliferate and spread systemically through the tissues. During this period, the host reacts against the parasite by generating a strong cell-mediated immune response that is able to eliminate most of the circulating tachyzoites. However, some of the organisms transform to a slowly replicating stage, the bradyzoite, which forms cysts mainly in certain immune privileged organs, such as the central nervous system or the eye, but also in other tissues. Once encysted, bradyzoites can remain for long periods of time, where they maintain latent infection. Immunodeficiencies, such as AIDS, can lead to a shift in the dynamic equilibrium that maintains bradyzoite dormancy, causing the parasites to transform back to the tachyzoite stage, resulting in reactivation of the infection [1].

Resistance to both acute and chronic infection appears to be highly dependent on cell-mediated effector responses. The lymphokine IFN-γ plays a major role in this cellular immune mechanism [2]. Deficiencies in IFN-γ production, its receptor-mediated signaling pathway, its putative cell sources, such as NK [3], CD4⁺ or CD8⁺ T [4] cells, or some of its downstream effector molecules, such as iNOS [5], IGTP [6] or LRG-47 [7] result in increased susceptibility to *T. gondii*. The major cytokine responsible for IFN-γ induction in parasite-infected mice is IL-12. In turn, deficiencies in IL-12 [8], its receptor signaling [9] or the transcription factor ICSBP [10] involved in its induction all render mice extremely susceptible to acute infection, with survival rates similar to those observed in IFN-γ-deficient animals. Thus, the IL-12/IFN-γ immune response axis plays a crucial role in determining resistance to *T. gondii* infection.

## 2. Role of DCs in IL-12 production after *T. gondii* stimulation

A number of cell types have been shown to produce IL-12 in response to in vitro infection with *T. gondii* or

exposure to tachyzoite extract (STAg). The key producers appear to be macrophages, neutrophils and DCs [11–13]. Interestingly, resting macrophages require both parasite signals and costimulation by IFN-γ [13] in order to produce significant amounts of IL-12. This observation suggests that the role of macrophages in the initiation of the IL-12 cascade in vivo is likely to be minimal. Instead, these cells may be more important in maintaining IL-12 production during the chronic phase when priming levels of IFN-γ are present and when both cytokines are necessary for preventing reactivation of infection [14].

Neutrophils have been shown to migrate rapidly within 2–3 h to the site of parasite inoculation and secrete prestored IL-12 both in vivo and in vitro upon stimulation with tachyzoites. Although the amounts of IL-12 released per cell are relatively low, the massive accumulation of neutrophils that occurs is likely to contribute to a biologically significant protective effect during early infection [12]. This conclusion is supported by the observation that neutrophil depletion leads to increased susceptibility to infection.

The observation that *T. gondii*-stimulated spleen cells from uninfected mice can produce IL-12 even in the absence of T lymphocytes or IFN-γ led to the discovery of a third cell population which can act as a source of the former cytokine. To identify these cells, mice were injected with STAg or live tachyzoites and their spleens stained immunohistochemically for IL-12. All of the IL-12-positive cells were found in T-cell areas of spleen and were shown by FACS analysis to be CD11c⁺ DEC 205⁺ DCs. Further analysis in vivo and in vitro revealed that STAg-stimulated IL-12p40 production is confined to the CD8α⁺ subset of murine DCs [13]. The IL-12 response of DCs to *T. gondii* is extremely rapid, peaking within a few hours, and exceeds that observed with most other known microbial stimulators of IL-12 production. These observations make CD8α⁺ DCs a strong candidate for the cell population responsible for initiating the IL-12/IFN-γ cascade during early *T. gondii*.

Interestingly, once the DC IL-12 response induced by STAg injection fades, it cannot be recalled by reinjection of the *T. gondii* extract for a period of almost a week. This phenomenon, which was termed “DC paralysis”, was shown neither to depend on suppression by IL-10 or T cells nor to be the result of DC apoptosis. Importantly, the induction of DC paralysis was shown to result in decreased systemic IL-12 and IFN-γ production as well as immunopathology following infection with live *T. gondii* [15].

As already mentioned above, within hours of STAg injection, DCs move from the red pulp and marginal zone and cluster around the central arteriole within the T-cell areas of the spleen. This dramatic cellular mobilization is consistent with the concept that after encounter with antigen and subsequent activation, DCs form a close interaction with T cells in the white pulp, establishing a so-called “bridge” between innate and adaptive immunity [13]. As suggested by subsequent studies [16], the T-cell activation that ensues may further promote IL-12 p70 production by

DCs through CD40/CD40L interaction that augments synthesis of both the p40 and p35 subunits of the cytokine.

### 3. Involvement of CCR5/G-protein signaling in DC migration induced by *T. gondii*

Since the events following STAg injection provide a striking example of the scenario expected during microbial-induced DC activation and T-cell priming, we decided to analyze this model in greater detail. We began by investigating the signals required for the dramatic migration of DCs into splenic T-cell areas observed after in vivo stimulation with STAg and focused on the likely role of chemokine/chemokine receptor interactions in this process. Upregulated expression of the mRNAs for the chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, MCP-1 and IP-10 (now designated as CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL2 and CXCL10, respectively) was detected in spleen as early as 1 h after STAg injection (Fig. 1). In situ analysis revealed endothelial cells and DCs themselves as major sources for the MIP-1α and MIP-1β observed. Interestingly, the endothelial-cell-produced chemokine was localized to the central arteriole, where it was detected for at least 6 h following STAg stimulation. This observation may be important in explaining the centripetal movement of DCs occurring within the T-cell areas. The production of MIP-1α and MIP-1β by DCs and endothelial cells in response to STAg was confirmed in

in vitro studies employing a murine endothelial cell line and purified CD11c⁺ splenic DCs [17].

Since there is marked redundancy between ligands and receptors in the chemokine system, the biological specificity of chemokine signaling may derive in part from the expression of chemokine receptors by distinct cell populations at distinct times during the immune response [18]. DCs are known to express a large number of chemokine receptors, including CCR1, CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR9, CXCR4 and CX₃CR1 [19–24]. CCR1, CCR2, CCR5 and CCR6 are thought to be expressed mainly by immature cells. During maturation, these receptors are downregulated, while expression of CCR7 is upregulated. This “switch” in receptor expression may reflect the changing biological activities of DCs during the immune response. Thus, a major function of immature DCs is to migrate into inflammatory sites in response to CCR1 and CCR5 ligands [22]. Once DCs reach the inflammatory foci, they capture and process the antigen and mature, downregulating CCR1 and CCR5 and upregulating CCR7, which facilitates their homing into T-cell areas of secondary lymphoid organs.

Since CCR5 is a major chemokine receptor expressed on DCs, we investigated its possible role in STAg-induced DC migration. Interestingly, both normal mice treated with a CCR5 antagonist (Met-RANTES) and CCR5-deficient animals showed a defective pattern of splenic DC mobilization following STAg injection, in which DCs move into white pulp but fail to cluster in T-cell areas [17]. This observation supports a model of DC mobilization in which DCs are drawn into white pulp by a CCR5-independent mechanism and then induced to form tight clusters by a CCR5/chemokine ligand interaction. The role of G-protein-coupled receptors in STAg-induced DC migration is further supported by experiments performed on Gᵢα₂-deficient mice, which lack a key protein involved in chemokine receptor signaling. These animals, in contrast to CCR5-deficient mice, show no DC migration at all in response to STAg injection (He et al., in preparation).

### 4. Role of CCR5 in *T. gondii*-induced IL-12 production by DCs

An unexpected finding in our study of the role of chemokines in STAg-induced DC migration was the observation that CCR5-deficient mice show greatly impaired DC IL-12 production in response to this parasite stimulus in vivo [17]. More importantly, DCs from CCR5-deficient mice were found to produce 60–75% less IL-12p40 than wild-type DC. Similar and even more profound reductions in DC IL-12 synthesis were observed in pertussis toxin-treated or Gᵢα₂-deficient mice in which G-protein-coupled signaling is disrupted (He et al., in preparation). These findings indicate that in addition to its role in cell migration, CCR5 signaling plays an important role in the activation of DCs by STAg as judged by IL-12 induction.

Two additional points are important in deciphering the mechanism by which CCR5 interaction leads to DC IL-12 production. First, STAg was found to induce vigorous CCR5 chemokine ligand production by DCs as well as endothelial cells in vitro. Secondly, while causing a pronounced reduction in the DC IL-12 response, CCR5 deficiency did not result in a total ablation of IL-12 secretion.

Based on the above findings, we have proposed two general mechanisms by which STAg could trigger DC IL-12 production by a CCR5-dependent pathway. The first hypothesis argues that STAg induces a low-level cytokine response by direct activation of the IL-12p40 gene and that this response is then enhanced by autocrine production of CCR5 ligands and subsequent receptor interaction (Fig. 2A). In

![Figure 2](#fig-2)

**Autocrine stimulation model**

**Chemokine mimicry model**

Fig. 2. Current hypotheses for the role of CCR5 in STAg-induced IL-12 production from DCs. In the model shown in panel A, STAg induces both low-level IL-12p40 gene expression and CCR5 chemokine ligands in DCs through an unknown microbial receptor. The chemokines produced then interact in autocrine fashion with CCR5, thereby amplifying IL-12 production. The model shown in panel B also proposes that IL-12 induction by STAg involves interaction with CCR5 as well as an unknown microbial receptor. However, the ligand that stimulates CCR5 signaling in this case is a parasite-derived mimic of a CCR5 ligand.

contrast, in an alternative hypothesis, the second enhancing signal is provided not by endogenous chemokine ligands but by a component in STAg that acts as a CCR5 ligand mimic (Fig. 2B). In both cases, the primary role of CCR5 interaction is to greatly amplify a weak signal provided by an as yet undetermined parasite triggering molecule. An interesting aspect of this system, regardless of which model holds, is that G-protein-coupled CCR5 signaling acts as an enhancing factor for IL-12 production in conjunction with *T. gondii* signaling. This is in direct contrast to the situation with LPS or CpG-DNA triggering, where the absence of Gi signaling leads to enhanced IL-12 production in both macrophages and DCs [25]. One implication of the above observations is that G-coupled signaling can be either inhibitory or stimulatory, depending on the particular microbial triggering pathway to which it is linked.

### 5. Relevance to immunity in vivo

Cell trafficking constitutes an essential “check point” in the development of effective immune responses. Consistent with the primary role of chemokine and chemokine receptors in directing cell trafficking, mice with genetic deficiencies in these molecules have been reported to show increased susceptibility to a variety of pathogens. Mice deficient in CCR5 have previously been shown to be less resistant to infection with *Leishmania donovani* [26] as well as *Cryptococcus neoformans* [27]. In agreement with our observation of decreased IL-12 production in STAg-stimulated CCR5-deficient DC, CCR5 knockout mice showed increased susceptibility to *T. gondii*, succumbing within 2 weeks of infection (Fig. 3). These animals also showed higher parasite cyst counts that correlated with lower serum levels of both IL-12 and IFN-γ [17].

Giα2-deficient mice were also highly susceptible to *T. gondii* infection and also displayed reduced levels of serum IL-12 and IFN-γ (He et al., in preparation), consistent with a role for G-protein-coupled signaling in IL-12-dependent resistance to this parasite. Interestingly, in a previous study, it was shown that these same animals exhibit augmented resistance to *L. major* while producing higher levels of Th1 cytokines [25]. Taken together, both observations support the hypothesis discussed above that Giα2 signaling may function by either stimulating or inhibiting the development of proinflammatory responses.

An important question is whether our observations on the role of CCR5 in host resistance to *T. gondii* in mice are relevant to human disease. A recessive mutation, *ccr5Δ32*, has been described that results in defective CCR5 coreceptor function for HIV infection in humans [28,29]. While this mutation does not seem to cause any major health problem in its carriers, individuals with mutations have been recently shown to have increased susceptibility to hepatitis C infection [30]. Nevertheless, in the case of *T. gondii*, one study suggested that *ccr5Δ32* carriers might actually be more resistant to the parasite. The interpretation of this observation is somewhat complicated by the fact that most of the Δ32 patients studied was heterozygous for the mutation [28,29]. Thus, the involvement of CCR5 signaling in host resistance to *T. gondii* in humans remains an open question.

### 6. Regulation of IL-12 production by G-protein-coupled receptors

Despite its role in host resistance, IL-12-dependent IFN-γ production can lead to tissue damage and mortality when not properly controlled [31]. An excellent example of the deleterious effects of uncontrolled IFN-γ production can be seen in the response of IL-10-deficient mice to *T. gondii* infection [32]. IL-10 plays a major role in downregulating IL-12 synthesis by antigen-presenting cells and IFN-γ production by T cells. In the absence of IL-10, *T. gondii* infection induces uncontrolled inflammatory cytokine production, resulting in both immunopathology and rapid death of the animals [32]. Such findings stress the need for the immune system to carefully regulate the IL-12/IFN-γ axis following microbial stimulation. Remarkably, a variety of regulatory pathways for controlling IL-12 production by APC have been demonstrated. The redundancy observed emphasizes the critical importance of this control process for host survival [33]. In addition to the induction of downregulatory cytokines, such as IL-10, many of these pathways involve G-protein-coupled receptors, including chemokine receptors, such as CCR2 [34], or chemotactic receptors, such as the formyl-peptide receptor (FPR) [35].

As described above, we observed that STAg-induced IL-12 production by DCs is tightly regulated and that upon in vivo stimulation, DCs become “paralyzed” for a period of approximately 1 week, as evidenced by their inability to respond to injected STAg. By measuring CCR5 expression on freshly isolated DCs following in vivo STAg stimulation, we

![Figure 3](#fig:3)

**Fig. 3.** CCR5-deficient mice show increased susceptibility to *T. gondii* infection. Wild-type or CCR5-deficient mice (*n* = 10 mice per group) were infected i.p. with 20 cysts of *T. gondii* (ME49 strain). Survival was monitored throughout the acute phase of infection.

observed a correlation between the levels of this chemokine receptor and the kinetics of IL-12 paralysis, suggesting that the latter phenomenon is due to the down regulation of CCR5 on DCs [36]. One mechanism that could account for this downregulation in CCR5 expression involves ligation of another set of G-protein-coupled receptors that have been previously shown to bind bacterial derived formyl-peptides [37–39]. One of these, FPRL-1, is also known to bind with high-affinity members of a newly described family of eicosanoid mediators, the lipoxins. These arachidonic acid derivatives are products of multiple transcellular pathways catalyzed by lipoxygenases (LOs), including 5-, 8- and 15-lipoxygenases (see Ref. [40] for review). Initially described as antagonizing the proinflammatory effects of leukotrienes, also products of LO-dependent pathways [41], lipoxins have now been described as having broad antiinflammatory activity in a number of different systems [42]. Previous studies had demonstrated that ligation of FPRL-1 by an HIV envelope-derived peptide results in the downregulation of CCR5 on human monocytes [37–39]. Because of FPRL-1’s reported binding of lipoxin and, in particular lipoxin A₄ (LXA₄), we asked ourselves whether LXA₄ is involved in the loss of CCR5 function observed during the induction of paralysis by STAg injection.

Indeed, in vivo administration of STAg was shown to upregulate LXA₄ secretion in mouse spleen within 6 h

following injection of the extract [36]. This response was found to be ablated in mice lacking the gene for 5-LO. Importantly, we were unable to induce paralysis in the same 5-LO knockout animals in contrast to wild-type mice, and DCs from these 5-LO-deficient mice displayed faster recovery of CCR5 expression than did the normal controls. In support of these observations, we showed that LXA₄, when added to DC cultures 24 h previously, dramatically inhibits the IL-12 production induced by STAg. Moreover, injection of a stable LXA₄ analog markedly suppressed the induction of IL-12 from DCs by STAg in vivo. Interestingly, the LXA₄ analog-treated mice also showed defective DC mobilization in the spleen, suggesting that ligation of FPRL-1 has broad inhibitory effects on chemokine-induced DC function in vivo [36].

Based on these findings, we speculate that, in addition to triggering CCR5 signaling, molecules in STAg induce the production of LXA₄. This eicosanoid, by binding to FPRL-1 on DCs, downmodulates CCR5’s as well as other chemokine receptor’s activities involved in DC migration. LXA₄-mediated CCR5 downregulation would function together with the normal process of ligand-mediated chemokine receptor endocytosis to maintain long-term suppression of CCR5 activity and, consequently, IL-12 production (Fig. 4).

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Fig. 4. Hypothesis for paralysis induction and regulation of CCR5 expression by endogenously secreted LXA₄. At the same time as STAg induces IL-12 from DCs, it also upregulates 5-LO expression in a CD11bhigh population present in spleen, thereby promoting LXA₄ synthesis. CCR5 becomes downregulated as a consequence of its interaction with the STAg-derived CCR5 ligand mimic (see Fig. 2B) or by STAg-induced CCR5 chemokines as a result of receptor internalization. This suppression of CCR5 expression is then maintained by an LXA₄-dependent mechanism, possibly triggered through FPRL-1 binding. As a result, during the interval of 12 h until 6 d post injection, IL-12 production cannot be recalled. After this period, both CCR5 expression and IL-12 responses to a second STAg injection are restored because of either declining LXA₄ levels or the recruitment of new DCs from the bone marrow.

7. Conclusions and significance

The findings described in this review emphasize the powerful role played by chemokine/chemokine receptor interactions in governing the innate response of DCs to microbial challenge. It is important to note, however, that *Toxoplasma* may offer a particularly dramatic example of this form of regulation because of its unusual use of CCR5 as a signaling element for IL-12 induction. Many questions remain to be answered. These concern the nature of the parasite ligand involved in CCR5 and LXA₄ triggering and the formal identification of FPRL-1 as the LXA₄ binding receptor mediating paralysis induction, as well as the fascinating question of why CCR5-dependent G-protein signaling is stimulatory in the case of *T. gondii* but inhibitory in the case of other microbial stimuli. Regardless, it is clear from the many in vivo correlates observed in our studies that exogenous manipulation of this pathway may offer a powerful strategy for regulating DC function with the goal of enhancing host resistance or preventing immunopathology.
