Hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein is suspected to participate in oncogenesis during chronic hepatitis B progression. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling involves both tumor suppression and oncogenesis. TGF-β activates TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which differentially phosphorylate the mediator Smad3 to become C-terminally phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3C) and linker-phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3L). Reversible shifting of Smad3-mediated signaling between tumor suppression and oncogenesis in HBx-expressing hepatocytes indicated that TβRI-dependent pSmad3C transmitted a tumor-suppressive TGF-β signal, while JNK-dependent pSmad3L promoted cell growth. We used immunostaining, immunoblotting, and *in vitro* kinase assay to compare pSmad3L- and pSmad3C-mediated signaling in biopsy specimens representing chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from 90 patients chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) with signaling in liver specimens from HBx transgenic mice. In proportion to plasma HBV DNA levels, early chronic hepatitis B specimens showed prominence of pSmad3L in hepatocytic nuclei. HBx-activated JNK/pSmad3L/c-Myc oncogenic pathway was enhanced, while the TβRI/pSmad3C/p21<sup>WAF1</sup> tumor-suppressive pathway was impaired as human and mouse HBx-associated hepatocarcinogenesis progressed. Of 28 patients with chronic hepatitis B who showed strong oncogenic pSmad3L signaling, six developed HCC within 12 years; only one of 32 patients showing little pSmad3L developed HCC. In contrast, seven of 30 patients with little Smad3C phosphorylation developed HCC, while no patient who retained hepatocytic tumor-suppressive pSmad3C developed HCC within 12 years. **Conclusion:** HBx shifts hepatocytic TGF-β signaling from the tumor-suppressive pSmad3C pathway to the oncogenic pSmad3L pathway in early carcinogenic process. Hepatocytic pSmad3L and pSmad3C assessment in HBV-infected liver specimens should prove clinically useful for predicting risk of HCC. (HEPATOLOGY 2009;49:1203-1217.)

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and one of the most deadly, causing approximately 600,000 deaths yearly.$^{1}$ The overall incidence of HCC continues to rise, especially in western Europe and the United States.$^{2}$ During the past 20 years, striking advances have enhanced our understanding of HCC. More than 85% of HCC cases are related to known hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).

A strong correlation between chronic HBV infection and HCC occurrence has long been apparent according to epidemiologic evidence and the finding of integrated HBV DNA sequences in virtually all HBV-related HCC.³ Hepatitis B virus X (HBx) oncoprotein has been implicated in HBV-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis,⁴,⁵ and persistent high-level expression of HBx protein in transgenic mouse liver results in hyperplasia leading to HCC, with no preceding inflammation.⁶ Although HBx does not bind DNA directly, HBx activates Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways including extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK),⁷ resulting in tumor cell growth and survival.

Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) can inhibit epithelial cell growth, acting as a tumor suppressor. During carcinogenesis, however, cancer cells gain advantage by selective reduction of the tumor-suppressive activity of TGF-β together with augmentation of its oncogenic activity.⁸ This led us to hypothesize that alterations in the TGF-β signal transduction pathway could be involved in the development of HCC in long-standing HBV infection.

Smads are central mediators of signals from the receptors for TGF-β superfamily members to the nucleus.⁹ Smads are modular proteins with conserved Mad-homology 1, intermediate linker, and Mad-homology 2 domains.¹⁰ The catalytically active TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) phosphorylates the C-terminal serine residues of receptor-activated Smads, which include Smad2 and the highly related protein Smad3. The linker domain can undergo regulatory phosphorylation by other kinases including mitogen-activated protein kinases and cyclin-dependent kinases.¹¹⁻¹⁴ In contrast to the clearly activating role of the C-terminal phosphorylation events, the regulation of Smad activity by phosphorylation of the linker region is complex. Linker phosphorylation of Smad2 during human colorectal carcinogenesis results in cytoplasmic retention of Smad2 and inhibition of tumor-suppressive TGF-β signaling.¹¹,¹⁵ However, Smad3 phosphorylated at the linker region (pSmad3L) is localized predominantly to cell nuclei in actively growing Ki-67-immunoreactive colon cancer with distant metastasis.¹⁵ Reversible shifting of Smad-dependent signaling between tumor suppression and oncogenesis in hyperactive Ras-expressing cells indicates that Smad3 phosphorylated at the C-terminal region (pSmad3C) transmits a tumor-suppressive TGF-β signal, whereas oncogenic activities such as cell proliferation and invasion are promoted by the pSmad3L pathway.¹⁶ In addition, Roberts' group¹⁷ has recently reported that Smad3 is critical for Ras/JNK-mediated transformation. Taken together, these findings indicate that oncogenic TGF-β signaling results from the functional collaboration of Ras and Smad3 rather than from Ras-mediated inhibition of the Smad3 pathway. Linker phosphorylation of Smad3 indirectly inhibits C-terminal phosphorylation, minimizing tumor-suppressive pSmad3C signaling.¹⁶ Notably, pSmad3L-mediated signaling in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) promotes liver fibrosis by stimulating extracellular matrix deposition.¹³,¹⁸

The role of HBV and HCV in tumor formation appears to be complex and may involve both direct and indirect mechanisms.¹⁹ Integration of HBV DNA into the host genome occurs at early steps of clonal tumor expansion. Alternatively, chronic liver inflammation and hepatic regeneration induced by host cellular immune responses can increase the risk of HCC development. During progression of HCV-related chronic liver disorders, hepatocytes affected by chronic inflammation undergo a transition from the tumor-suppressive pSmad3C pathway to the JNK/pSmad3L pathway.²⁰ Our present studies extend the previous observations to HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis. We study Smad3 phosphorylation profiles in HBV-infected human liver and HBx transgenic mouse liver, concluding that HBx oncoprotein in early stages of chronic hepatitis B contributes directly to hepatocarcinogenesis by shifting hepatocytic Smad3-mediated signaling from tumor suppression to oncogenesis.

## Patients and Methods

### Patients, Follow-up, and Detection of HCC

Ninety patients with HBV-related chronic liver disease underwent liver biopsy at the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology of Kansai Medical University Hospital between 1992 and 1994. All patients were seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) and were seronegative for anti-HCV antibody (Ortho Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan). Patients included 70 with chronic hepatitis, 10 with cir-

rhosis, and 10 with HCC. Sixty of the chronic hepatitis patients were enrolled in a program for early diagnosis of HCC; the other 10 were lost to follow-up. HBV DNA (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan) and hepatitis B envelope antigen (Abbott Laboratories) were measured at the time of liver biopsy. During the surveillance period, patients were followed up with abdominal ultrasonography and plasma alpha-fetoprotein determinations every 3 to 6 months. We also made a random choice of 20 chronic hepatitis B specimens with little fibrosis (F1) and little inflammation (A1) from the liver biopsy specimens of the patients showing high plasma HBV DNA levels.

Necroinflammatory activity and fibrotic stage were graded histologically according to the classification of Desmet and colleagues.²¹ We counted and scored pSmad3, HBx, and c-Myc positivity in hepatocytes as follows: 0, no positivity; 1, <25%; 2, 25% to 50%; 3, 50% to 75%; 4, >75%.²⁰ Written informed consent was obtained from each patient according to the Helsinki Declaration. We also obtained approval for this study from our institutional ethics committee.

**Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction.** Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction of TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII), Smad2, and Smad4 genes was performed as described.¹⁵

**Domain-Specific Antibodies Against the Phosphorylated Smad3.** Two polyclonal anti-phospho-Smad3 sera—α pSmad3L (Ser 208/213) and α pSmad3C (Ser 423/425)—were raised against the phosphorylated linker and C-terminal regions of Smad3 by immunization of rabbits with synthetic peptides. Relevant antisera were affinity-purified using phosphorylated peptides as described.¹³

**Transgenic Animals.** HBx transgenic mice were derived by microinjection of a 1151-bp HBV DNA fragment containing the HBx gene with its own regulatory elements and polyadenylation signal into fertilized eggs of CD-1 mice. An independent line (H9) was derived from founders.⁶

**Immunohistochemical and Immunofluorescence Analyses.** Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses were performed as described.¹⁸ Primary antibodies (Abs) used in this study included mouse monoclonal anti-HBx Ab (2 μg/mL; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc Ab (10 μg/mL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse monoclonal anti-p21<sup>WAF1</sup> Ab (0.5 μg/mL; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), in addition to the affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-pSmad3L (2 μg/mL) and anti-pSmad3C (0.5 μg/mL) as described above. Anti-pSmad3C Ab cross-reacted weakly with C-terminally phosphorylated Smad2: to block binding of anti-

pSmad3C Ab to phosphorylated domains in Smad2, anti-pSmad3C Ab was adsorbed with 1 μg/mL C-terminally phosphorylated Smad2 peptide.

For immunohistochemical analyses, sections exposed to primary Abs were then incubated with peroxidase-labeled polymer conjugated to goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (DAKO). Finally, sections were developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and mounted under coverslips.

For double-labeling immunofluorescence analyses, sections exposed to a pair of primary Abs (rabbit plus mouse) were then incubated in a 1:500 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with a red fluorophore (Alexa Fluor 594; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with a green fluorophore (Alexa Fluor 488; Molecular Probes). Images were obtained with a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Oberkochen, Germany).

**Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting.** pSmad3L and pSmad3C immunoblots on Smad3 immunoprecipitates of cell extracts from frozen tissues representing either HCC or underlying liver diseases were performed as described.²⁰

**In Vitro Kinase Assay.** In vitro kinase assay was performed as described.¹²

**Statistical Analyses.** The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine the cumulative probability of appearance of HCC during the 12-year follow-up period. HCC occurrence curves were compared between patients with abundant (scores 3 to 4) and those with sparse (scores 0 to 2) Smad3L/C phosphorylation, by means of the log-rank test. For continuous variables, the optimal cutoff threshold for defining groups was established using receiver operating characteristics curves. All parameters with *P* values less than 0.10 in the univariate analysis were selected for multivariate analysis, which was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model.²² *P* values less than 0.05 were considered significant. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to identify significant differences in hepatic pSmad3L and pSmad3C positivity among fibrotic stages.

## Results

**Two Distinct Hepatocytic Smad3 Signaling Pathways in Human Chronic Hepatitis B: pSmad3L- and pSmad3C-Dominant Types.** We initially analyzed mutations of TβRII, Smad2, and Smad4 genes in 10 HCC and six cirrhotic liver samples, finding no mutations in

* Hepatocytic Smad3 phosphorylation is scored as follows: 0, no phosphorylation; 1, <25% Smad3 phosphorylation; 2, 25% to 50% Smad3 phosphorylation; 3, 50% to 75% Smad3 phosphorylation; 4, >75% Smad3 phosphorylation.

† Necroinflammatory activity and fibrotic stage are determined histologically according to Desmet's classification.

hepatitis B specimens was divided into two distinct patterns. In one liver specimen with moderate fibrosis and inflammation from patient 2 in Table 2 who was diagnosed with HCC 9 years later, intense pSmad3L immunostaining was present in the nuclei of all hepatocytes throughout the liver lobules; C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad3 was strongly suppressed in hepatocytic nuclei (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. 1). In another specimen with similar fibrotic stage and necroinflammatory activity from patient 44 in Table 2 who had not developed HCC, many hepatocytes retained phosphorylation at Smad3C but showed scarce phosphorylation at Smad3L (Fig. 1B). Among 37 patients with chronic hepatitis B who had strong pSmad3L positivity, 24 patients showed little Smad3C phosphorylation, and only 13 patients

*Hepatocytic Smad3 phosphorylation is scored as follows: 0, no phosphorylation; 1, <25% Smad3 phosphorylation; 2, 25% to 50% Smad3 phosphorylation; 3, 50% to 75% Smad3 phosphorylation; 4, >75% Smad3 phosphorylation.

showed abundant Smad3C phosphorylation (64.9% versus 35.1% [P = 0.03]) (Table 3). In contrast, 22 patients with little Smad3L phosphorylation (scores 0 to 2) versus only 13 patients with abundant Smad3L phosphorylation (scores 3 to 4) showed strong pSmad3C positivity (62.9% versus 37.1% [P = 0.04]). Because the extent of Smad3L phosphorylation increased as fibrotic stage and necroinflammatory activity progressed in chronic hepatitis C, Smad3L showed little phosphorylation in early chronic hepatitis C.²⁰ In contrast, degree of linker phosphorylation of Smad3 in hepatocytic nuclei remained high (staining scored as 3 or 4) in 21 of 47 patients with chronic hepatitis B (F1 to F2) (Fig. 1C). These results indicate differential mechanisms of HBV- and HCV-

**Fig. 1. Two distinct hepatocytic Smad3 signaling pathways in early chronic hepatitis B: pSmad3L- and pSmad3C-dominant types.** (A) Smad3 in the nuclei of hepatocytes was phosphorylated sparsely at the C-terminal region (α pSmad3C column) but intensely at the linker region (α pSmad3L column). The liver specimen showing moderate fibrosis and inflammation was obtained from patient 2 in Table 2 diagnosed with HCC 9 years later. Bar = 50 μm. (B) In patient 44 in Table 2 who had not developed HCC, hepatocytes retained phosphorylation at Smad3C (α pSmad3C column) but showed little phosphorylation at Smad3L (α pSmad3L column). The specimen showed degrees of fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity similar to those in (A). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver sections were stained with anti-pSmad3L Ab (α pSmad3L column) and anti-pSmad3C Ab (α pSmad3C column). The pSmad3C section was paired with an adjacent section stained using anti-pSmad3L Ab. Abs were then bound by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase-labeled polymer. Peroxidase activity was detected with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. All sections were counterstained with hematoxylin (blue). Brown color indicates specific Ab reactivity. Bar = 50 μm. (C) Degrees of Smad3 phosphorylation were stable in hepatocytic nuclei in early chronic hepatitis B specimens (F1 to F2), whereas pSmad3L increased and pSmad3C decreased as chronic hepatitis B (F3) progressed through cirrhosis to HCC. Smad3 phosphorylation in hepatocytes did not change between F1 and F2 stages. Phosphorylation of Smad3L and Smad3C in hepatocytes of cirrhotic liver (F4) and HCC was greater and less than that in livers with grade F1 and F2 fibrosis, respectively. Extent of Smad3 phosphorylation: □, 0; ■, 1; ■, 2; ■, 3; ■, 4. *P < 0.05.

associated carcinogenesis, especially in the early stages of chronic hepatitis.

**pSmad3L Prominence in Hepatocytic Nuclei in Proportion to Plasma HBV DNA Levels.** Because HCC risk is related to plasma HBV DNA levels and chronic inflammation,²⁴ we next investigated the correlation of hepatocytic pSmad3L positivity with plasma HBV DNA levels and necroinflammatory activity in chronic hepatitis B patients (Fig. 2). Positivity of hepatocytic nuclei for pSmad3L in chronic hepatitis B specimens gradually increased in proportion to amounts of HBV DNA.

Sixteen sera samples of 35 patients with abundant Smad3L phosphorylation (scores 3 to 4) but only seven sera samples of 35 patients with little Smad3L phosphorylation (scores 0 to 2) contained more than 5.0 log copies/mL (45.7% versus 20.0% [P = 0.02]) (Fig. 2A). However, 23 of 35 chronic hepatitis B patients with abundant Smad3L phosphorylation and 22 of 35 patients with little Smad3L phosphorylation showed a high level of inflammatory activity (A 2 to 3) (65.7% versus 62.9% [P = 0.80]) (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that HBV itself could up-regulate the hepatocytic phosphorylation at Smad3L, but inflammation could not strongly affect linker phosphorylation.

To further confirm the direct effects of HBV, besides chronic inflammation, on phosphorylation at Smad3L in early chronic hepatitis B, we examined the degrees of pSmad3L and pSmad3C in a group of patients with little fibrosis (F1), little inflammation (A1), and high plasma HBV DNA. Smad3L was highly phosphorylated in hepatocytic nuclei, whereas the phosphorylation at Smad3C was suppressed (Fig. 2C). Of 20 chronic hepatitis B samples, 12 samples showed abundant Smad3L phosphorylation (scores 3 to 4), but only five samples had abundant Smad3C phosphorylation (60.0% versus 25.0% [P = 0.03]) (Table 4).

**HBx Protein Involvement in c-Myc–Mediated Oncogenic Activity via the pSmad3L Pathway in Human Chronic Hepatitis B.** Integrated viral sequences produce HBx protein, which brings about up-regulation of c-Myc oncoprotein.²⁵ We therefore investigated whether HBx protein affected Smad3L phosphorylation and expression of c-Myc in biopsy specimens from HBV-infected livers by immunostaining sections for

Fig. 2. In proportion to plasma HBV DNA levels, JNK-dependent pSmad3L became prominent in the nuclei of hepatocytes in human early chronic hepatitis B. (A) Positivity for pSmad3L in hepatocytic nuclei in chronic hepatitis B specimens was greater in proportion to plasma HBV DNA levels. Patients with strong pSmad3L positivity in hepatocytic nuclei (staining scored as 3 or 4) had more HBV DNA in plasma than patients with weak pSmad3L positivity (staining scored as 0 to 2). Hepatocytic Smad3 phosphorylation in chronic hepatitis B specimens is scored as follows: 0, no phosphorylation; 1, <25%; 2, 25% to 50%; 3, 50% to 75%; 4, >75%. (B) Degree of Smad3 phosphorylation at the linker region did not strongly correlate with necroinflammatory activity of chronic hepatitis B. Hepatocytic Smad3 phosphorylation at the linker region in livers with necroinflammatory activities of A2 to A3 was essentially similar to phosphorylation in those with activities of A0 to A1. Extent of necroinflammatory activity: □, 0; ■, 1; ▪, 2; ■, 3. (C) Smad3 in the nuclei of hepatocytes was phosphorylated intensely at linker region (α pSmad3L column) but sparsely at the C-terminal region (α pSmad3C column). The liver specimen showing minimal fibrosis (F1) and inflammation (A1) was obtained from patient 10 in Table 2 who showed high plasma HBV DNA and was diagnosed with HCC 4 years later.

regulation of pSmad3L was seen with progression of  
hepatic fibrosis and carcinogenesis. In cirrhotic liver  
and HCC, pSmad3L was far more abundant than in  
chronic hepatitis. In contrast, pSmad3C gradually de-  
creased as disease stages progressed toward HCC (Fig.  
4C, α pSmad3C panel).

We previously reported that Smad3L served as a sub-  
strate for JNK.¹² To address the functional relationship  
between activated JNK and Smad3L phosphorylation  
during hepatocarcinogenesis, we presently assayed kinase  
activity *in vitro*. Although JNK from normal liver showed  
little ability to phosphorylate Smad3 at the linker region,  
JNK from livers involved by chronic hepatitis B, cirrhosis,  
and HCC could directly phosphorylate Smad3L (Fig.  
4D). These results suggested that JNK in preneoplastic  
liver tissues and HCC directly phosphorylated the linker  
region of Smad3.

Collectively, JNK/pSmad3L/c-Myc oncogenic sig-  
naling in hepatocytes came to predominate while the  
tumor-suppressive pSmad3C/p21<sup>WAF1</sup> pathway became  
quiescent as chronic hepatitis B progressed to cirrhosis and  
then HCC.

**Selective Blockade of Linker Phosphorylation Abol-  
ishes pSmad3L-Mediated Cell Growth in HBx-Ex-  
pressing Hepatocytes.** pSmad3L, HBx, and c-Myc were  
colocalized in preneoplastic lesions including chronic  
hepatitis and cirrhosis (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that  
HBx oncoprotein might alter hepatocytic TGF-β signal-  
ing in chronic hepatitis B. We investigated this hypothesis  
using HBx-expressing hepatocytes. Selective blockade of  
linker phosphorylation by a mutant Smad3 lacking the  
JNK-dependent linker phosphorylation sites abolished  
pSmad3L-mediated cell growth in HBx-expressing hepa-  
tocytes (Supplementary Figs. 3–5). These results suggest  
that HBx activated the JNK/pSmad3L pathway, further  
promoting cell proliferation by up-regulating c-Myc tran-  
scription (Fig. 5).

**Activation of the pSmad3L/c-Myc Pathway as HBx  
Transgenic Mouse Livers Progress Through Hyperpla-  
sia to HCC.** We further investigated localization of  
pSmad3L, HBx, and c-Myc during HBx-induced  
hepatocarcinogenesis in HBx transgenic mouse livers.  
Beginning at the age of 2 months, HBx transgenic  
mouse liver showed centrilobular foci of cellular alter-  
ation with cytoplasmic vacuolation surrounding the  
central veins where bromodeoxyuridine was uptaken  
into the hepatocytes.⁶

In this hyperplastic mouse liver, phosphorylation at  
Smad3L was observed in hepatocytic nuclei in the centri-  
lobular region, and distribution of pSmad3L was similar  
to those of HBx and c-Myc (Fig. 6A). pSmad3L, HBx,

Cell lysates obtained from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and surrounding nonneoplastic liver tissues including chronic hepatitis B (CH) or liver cirrhosis (LC) as well as uninvolved normal liver tissues from a patient with a metastatic liver tumor were subjected to anti-Smad3 immunoprecipitation (IP) and were then immunoblotted with each anti-pSmad3 Ab (upper panels). Relative amounts of endogenous Smad3 were determined via immunoblotting using anti-Smad3 Ab (bottom panel). (D) JNK in human HBV-related chronic liver tissue directly phosphorylated Smad3 at the linker region. Cell lysates obtained from HCC and surrounding nonneoplastic liver tissue including chronic hepatitis (CH) and liver cirrhosis (LC) from HBV-infected patients, as well as uninvolved normal liver tissue from a patient with a liver metastasis, were subjected to anti-phospho-JNK1/2 immunoprecipitation (IP), and were then mixed with bacterially expressed GST-Smad3 and GST-Smad2. After in vitro kinase assay, phosphorylation of Smad3L was analyzed via immunoblotting using anti-pSmad3L antibody (upper panel). Total Smad3 and Smad2 were determined via immunoblotting using anti-Smad2/3 Ab (lower panel).

and c-Myc were distributed diffusely in HCC specimens (Fig. 6B, HCC panel). Semiquantitative analyses of positivity for these molecules in HBx transgenic mouse livers also revealed that hepatocytic pSmad3L, HBx, and c-Myc increased as mouse liver progressed through hyperplasia to HCC (Fig. 6C). Double immunofluorescence studies in hyperplastic specimens confirmed that pSmad3L was colocalized in HBx- and c-Myc-immunoreactive hepatocytes (Fig. 6D).

Success in comparative study of HBx, pSmad3L, and c-Myc positivity during human and mouse hepatocarcinogenesis identified pSmad3L as a key regulatory element

that offers a general framework for understanding the origins of HBV-related HCC.

**Chronic Hepatitis B Patients with Hepatocytes Positive for pSmad3L and Negative for pSmad3C Increased Risk of HCC Development.** We finally investigated whether phosphorylation levels of Smad3 could affect the risk of neoplastic evolution in the patients with chronic hepatitis B (Table 2). To compare HCC incidence, patients were classified into those with abundant (scores 3 to 4) and limited (scores 0 to 2) Smad3 phosphorylation in hepatocytic nuclei. HCC developed in six of 28 patients with abundant Smad3L phosphory-

Fig. 5. Reversibility of Smad3-dependent signaling between tumor suppression and oncogenesis in HBx-expressing hepatocytes. Hepatocytes exhibit TGF-β-dependent Smad3 phosphorylation at the C-terminal region, which results in growth inhibition by repression of c-Myc. High expression of HBx protein in hepatocytes tends to shut down pSmad3C-mediated signaling and favor acquisition of constitutively active JNK-mediated pSmad3L signaling, which fosters cell growth by up-regulating c-Myc. Selective blockade of linker phosphorylation by a mutant Smad3 lacking the JNK-dependent linker phosphorylation sites (Smad3EPSM) restores the TGF-β-dependent tumor-suppressive response involving pSmad3C that is shown by parental hepatocytes.

lation, but in only one of 32 patients with limited Smad3L phosphorylation (log-rank = 0.03) (Fig. 7A). In contrast, HCC developed only in the patients with limited Smad3C phosphorylation, and no patients with abundant hepatocytic pSmad3C developed HCC (log-rank = 0.009) (Fig. 7B).

Several studies have analyzed risk factors for HCC occurrence in patients with HBV-related chronic liver disease, including elevated plasma HBV DNA²⁴ and seropositivity for hepatitis B e antigen.²⁶ In the univariate analysis, HCC occurrence in high pSmad3L positivity (*P* = 0.01), low pSmad3C positivity (*P* = 0.03), and plasma HBV-DNA levels of more than 5.0 log copies/mL (*P* = 0.05) showed *P* values less than 0.10, thus being significantly associated with HCC (Table 5). All variables with statistical significance in the univariate analysis were entered in the multivariate analysis, and high pSmad3L and low pSmad3C positivity were considered significantly predictive of HCC development within 12 years. Hepatocytic positivity for pSmad3L and pSmad3C should allow us to distinguish chronic hepatitis B patients at high and low risk for the development of HCC in near future.

**Discussion**

In patients with chronic hepatitis B, persistent HBV infection is clearly the primary inducer of HCC.¹⁻⁷ Comparative studies that seek to identify conserved oncogenic signaling common to HCC in both humans and experimental animals will help to eventually identify the molecular pathways that drive the development of HCC.²⁷ Much is known about the morphologic changes of cells and tissues that precede and accompany development of HCC in humans, allowing earlier diagnosis in some instances.²⁸ A variety of molecular alterations have been detected in fully developed HCC and to a lesser extent in morphologically defined preneoplastic lesions.²⁹ Our current studies compared pSmad3L- and pSmad3C-mediated signaling in biopsy specimens of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or HCC from 90 patients with chronic HBV infection versus signaling in preneoplastic and neoplastic liver lesions of HBx transgenic mice. Taken together with the results of *in vitro* experiments using HBx-expressing hepatocytes, our findings indicate that the HBx oncoprotein participates directly in hepatocarcinogenesis by shifting hepatocytic Smad3-mediated signaling from tumor suppression to oncogenesis in patients with early chronic hepatitis B (Fig. 7C). According to the two-step model of carcinogenesis (initiation and promotion), tumor formation can be explained by permanent HBx-dependent activation of the JNK/pSmad3L cascade that has a tumor promoter-like action.

HCC is a human neoplasm associated with viral infection.¹,³ At present, hepatitis virus–associated carcinogenesis can be seen as a multifactorial process that includes both direct and indirect mechanisms.¹⁹ A major factor in the process of HCC development is the host immune system.³⁰ Chronic inflammation, degeneration, and regeneration induced by the host cellular immune response are common to a variety of human liver diseases, and subsequent cellular proliferation might increase the risk of cancer. We previously reported that increased phosphorylation of Smad3L and decreased phosphorylation of Smad3C were associated with an increased risk of HCV-related HCC.²⁰ Similarly to HCV-related chronic liver disease, strong pSmad3L positivity was observed in the late stages of HBV-related chronic liver disease (F3 to F4) (Fig. 1C). Considering the development of HCC in HCV core gene-transgenic mice,³¹ hepatitis viruses themselves together with the host immune response might promote human hepatocarcinogenesis via the JNK/pSmad3L pathway during the late stage of the carcinogenic process in both HBV- and HCV-related chronic liver disease.

However, HBV and HCV have different roles in human hepatocarcinogenesis when early chronic hepatitis (F1 to F2) is considered. The histological severity of HCV-related liver disease correlates closely with the risk

(B) Distributions of pSmad3L, HBx, and c-Myc in normal liver, hyperplasia, and HCC specimens from HBx transgenic mice. Immunostaining for pSmad3L, HBx, and c-Myc was present in hyperplastic hepatocytes surrounding central veins in HBx transgenic mouse liver [(A) and (B), hyperplasia panels], and was distributed diffusely in HCC specimens [(B), HCC panel]. All sections were counterstained with hematoxylin (blue). Brown color indicates specific Ab reactivity. Bar = 50 μm. (C) Hepatocytic pSmad3L, HBx, and c-Myc increased as HBx transgenic mouse liver progressed from hyperplasia to HCC. Staining for pSmad3L, HBx, and c-Myc was detected minimally in normal mouse livers, but was strongly up-regulated in neoplastic livers. In HCC, pSmad3L, HBx, and c-Myc were significantly greater than in livers with hyperplasia. *P < 0.05. Extent of pSmad3L, HBx, and c-Myc: □, 0; ■, 1; ▪, 2; ■, 3; ■, 4. (D) Hepatocytic pSmad3L in hyperplastic specimens from HBx transgenic mouse liver was colocalized with HBx and c-Myc. Hyperplasia sections of HBx transgenic mouse livers were stained for immunofluorescence to simultaneously detect pSmad3L (red) and HBx or c-Myc (green). Yellow color indicates overlap of proteins.

of HCC.³² In contrast, HCC occasionally develops in healthy HBV surface antigen carriers, who are persistently infected with HBV but have normal liver function parameters and no necroinflammation.³³ This indicates that HBV itself has a direct influence on hepatocarcinogenesis in early chronic hepatitis B. Although integration of the viral genome into chromosomal DNA has not been reported in patients with HCV infection, integration of HBV has been detected in almost all cases of chronic hepatitis B,³ leading to activation of the HBx-mediated oncogenic pathway.⁴ It is noteworthy that HCC developed in patient 10 (Table 2), who showed strong pSmad3L positivity of hepatocytic nuclei but had minimal necroinflammatory activity (A1) or fibrosis (F1). In summary, HCV contributes indirectly to the development of HCC through chronic inflammation in early

chronic hepatitis C. In contrast, HBV directly triggers the JNK/pSmad3L oncogenic pathway in early chronic hepatitis B, thus playing a role beyond mere stimulation of the host immune response.

Our findings also open up a new avenue to understanding the development and progression of hepatic fibrogenesis.³⁴ Whereas HSCs have traditionally been considered as the principal source of liver fibrosis, mature hepatocytes can acquire a mesenchymal phenotype and perform the functions of activated HSC—that is, they can contribute to fibrogenesis.³⁵,³⁶ In support of this notion, pSmad3L-mediated signaling promotes liver fibrosis by hepatocytes as well as activated HSCs during long-standing carcinogenesis.¹³,¹⁸,²⁰ In this manner, either HBV- or HCV-related chronic hepatitis progresses through fibrogenesis to HCC.

The general biomedical approach to HCC is shifting away from population risk assessment and empirical treatment of patients to predictive personalized medicine based on molecular classification and targeted therapy.²⁹ Better knowledge of the risk factors associated with the occurrence of HCC can improve the effectiveness of surveillance programs. Our approach has identified pSmad3L and pSmad3C as prognostic markers that may prove to be clinically useful. Such predictive markers could allow us to select patients with chronic hepatitis B who have a high or low risk of developing HCC. Although the latter group could be followed up on an annual basis, the patients with a high risk require targeted surveillance measures to allow early diagnosis of HCC.

Phosphorylation of many transcription factors is controlled by the dynamic interplay between kinases and phosphatases. In this regard, we studied the kinetics of both linker and C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad3 in parental and HBx-expressing hepatocytes in response to TGF-β (unpublished observation). In parental hepatocytes, the levels of linker and C-terminal phosphorylation peaked at 30 minutes after the start of exposure to TGF-β and then gradually declined. However, HBx-expressing hepatocytes showed constitutive phosphorylation at Smad3L during continuous exposure to TGF-β. Several lines of evidence have identified small C-terminal domain phosphatase (SCP1-3) and protein phosphatase magnesium 1A (PPM1A) as the linker and C-terminal phosphatases, respectively.³⁷,³⁸ Accordingly, SCP1-3 and PPM1A may reverse domain-specific phosphorylation in normal hepatocytes. In contrast, HBx-expressing hepatocytes may not show induction or activation of SCP1-3. Alternatively, linker phosphorylation in HBx-expressing hepatocytes might be resistant to SCP1-3.

Many researchers have been seeking key transcription factors regulating tumor-suppressive pathways that are altered in cancer. Our current model of JNK/pSmad3L signaling during HBV-related chronic liver disease suggests that specific inhibitors of the JNK/pSmad3L pathway might inhibit the progression of HCC. With respect to molecular targeting therapy for human HCC, pSmad3L and pSmad3C should be assessed as biomarkers to evaluate the benefit from specific inhibition of the JNK/pSmad3L pathway.
