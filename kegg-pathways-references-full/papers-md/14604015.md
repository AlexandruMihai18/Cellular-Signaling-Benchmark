Potassium (K‚Å∫), an element necessary to life, is the major monovalent intracellular cation, reflecting a very ancient decision of living cells to accumulate K‚Å∫ and to exclude the smaller sodium (Na‚Å∫) ion. These ions act directly as cations since none of them form covalent bonds in aqueous environments. K‚Å∫ has four roles in bacteria: (i) an osmotic solute, (ii) an activator of intracellular enzymes, (iii) a regulator of internal pH, and (iv) a second messenger.

The marked diversity of structure and metabolism in the bacterial kingdom is not reflected in a similar diversity of ways bacteria deal with K‚Å∫. Only a few types of specific K‚Å∫-transport systems are found in bacteria, many are widely distributed in eubacteria and some are found in the distantly related archaea. Only for a few species do we have detailed knowledge of the way K‚Å∫ is transported and what its specific roles are. Data is most extensive for two enteric organisms, *Escherichia coli* and *Salmonella typhimurium*. Where no species is mentioned, the data are for one of these two closely related organisms. More extensive coverage of the older literature on K‚Å∫ can be found in a review (1).

Bacteria can be divided into two groups based on how they respond to growth at elevated osmolarity. A number of halophilic species, including eubacterial and archaeal species, use K‚Å∫ and to some extent Na‚Å∫ as major cytoplasmic-osmotic solutes regardless of medium osmolarity, behavior referred to as the ‚Äúsalt-in‚Äù adaptation (2). These species can grow only in media containing high concentrations of NaCl and have cytoplasmic contents adapted to high ionic strength. A large number of studies have examined the adaptations needed to allow enzymes to function well at high ionic strength (reviewed in Ref. (3)). However, there are few studies of K‚Å∫ transport in the halophiles. Most organisms, by contrast, use K‚Å∫ as a primary osmotic solute only during growth at low osmolarity. During growth at higher osmolarity, one of a number of neutral, polar molecules, ‚Äúcompatible solutes‚Äù is accumulated (4). K‚Å∫ appears to act as a second messenger to stimulate accumulation of compatible solutes.

The development of spectroscopic analysis by flame emission and later by atomic absorption in the middle of the last century has made analysis of inorganic cations sensitive and specific. There are also convenient radioactive tracers for virtually all cations. The only generally useful tracer for K‚Å∫ is ‚Å¥¬≤K‚Å∫, which has an inconveniently short half-life of only 12.4 h. The larger congenitor, ‚Å∏‚Å∂Rb‚Å∫ with a half-life of 18.8 days, is useful for most eucaryotic K‚Å∫-transport systems, but is not a good quantitative tracer for most bacterial K‚Å∫-transport systems since they discriminate against Rb‚Å∫.

An important feature of bacteria with walls is the maintenance of an osmotic pressure difference across the cell envelope, creating a hydrostatic pressure called turgor pressure. Turgor, as used here, refers to both the
pressure across the cell envelope as well as the tension it creates in the envelope. It is generally believed that turgor is essential for growth and is important in determining the shape of bacteria (5). Turgor is both a signal and an end product of K‚Å∫ transport: changes in cell K‚Å∫ concentration alter turgor while turgor is implicated as the signal-controlling activity of K‚Å∫-transport systems and the expression of one of them, Kdp. Since all of the proteins that create the solute gradients required for turgor, as well as those believed to respond to turgor, are in the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane of enteric and other Gram-negative bacteria, turgor is expected to be exerted across the inner membrane. An alternate view suggests that turgor is expressed across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (6,7). There is expected to be some turgor across the outer membrane, since fixed anionic charges on periplasmic macromolecules require cations to match, and this creates an electrical Donnan potential. Porins in the outer membrane allow small molecules free access to the periplasm, so ions will distribute themselves across the outer membrane at thermodynamic equilibrium and not at equal concentration. Since ions associated with macromolecules have low osmotic activity (8), the fraction of turgor expected to be expressed across the outer membrane is probably not large. Gram-positive bacteria have no outer membrane, so the equivalent model would have turgor expressed across their cell wall. It is virtually certain that a Donnan potential could not create the high turgor pressures of Gram-positive bacteria, as high as 20 atm in *Bacillus subtilis* (9). Therefore, turgor in Gram-positive bacteria, must be exerted across their cytoplasmic membrane. The suggestion that turgor in Gram-negative bacteria is expressed across the outer membrane implies that Gram-positive bacteria have a radically different way of establishing turgor although they share many of the systems that adjust and respond to turgor with Gram-negative bacteria. A number of other considerations also suggest that turgor for the most part is exerted across the inner membrane in Gram-negative bacteria (10).

The magnitude of turgor is expected to be fairly constant in growing cells if turgor is needed for growth, an expectation supported by the fact that the same degree of osmotic downshock was required to the release of K‚Å∫ in cells growing at high as well as low osmolarity (11). Recent measurements of cell solutes and water suggest that turgor is much lower in medium of higher osmolality (7). The calculated value of turgor of 3.1 atm at low osmolality fell to about 0.4 atm at an osmolality of 0.5 osM. The implication that bacteria can grow at such low values of turgor seems incompatible with the stress-theory of bacterial growth. The questions about the site where turgor is expressed and its magnitude must be resolved by further studies.

Vesicle systems make it possible to control the composition of the solution on both sides of the membrane, something not possible when whole cells are
used. However, in studying the effects of the solution facing the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, salts of unphysiologic anions such as chlorides and phosphates are often used. While some studies where the physiological anion, glutamate, was also used suggest the choice of anion is not crucial (see Section IV), it would be well to include glutamate since a number of cytoplasmic enzymes have altered the behavior with glutamate as compared to other anions (12).

# I. Paths of K‚Å∫ Movement

## A. Measuring K‚Å∫ Transport in Bacteria

The rate of K‚Å∫ uptake into cells depends on how it is measured. Bacteria generally regulate their cytoplasmic pool of K‚Å∫ rather tightly. The sole K‚Å∫ movement in nongrowing cells in the steady state is an exchange of external for internal K‚Å∫, a process whose measurement requires use of a radioactive tracer. Net uptake during growth reflects the low rate needed for growth and therefore does not reflect the capacity of transport systems. Net uptake limited by the capacity of transport systems can be measured in cells that have been depleted of K‚Å∫, or following an increase in medium osmolarity, a procedure referred to as osmotic upshock. Uptake in K‚Å∫-depleted cells is a convenient but artificial condition, while stimulation of net K‚Å∫ uptake by osmotic upshock reflects a basic physiological response of many K‚Å∫-transport systems.

Valid data require that the methods used to deplete cells of K‚Å∫ do not damage the transport systems under study. A variety of methods has been used to deplete bacteria of K‚Å∫, including treatment with high concentrations of 2,4-dinitrophenol (13), growth into the stationary phase (14), treatment with a divalent cation-chelating agent (15), treatment with a permeant amine at high pH (16), treatment with suitable ionophores (17), and washing with low osmolarity solutions free of K‚Å∫ (18,19). The rapid loss of K‚Å∫ after treatment with 2,4-dinitrophenol, a classical protonophore, suggests that when present at high concentrations it acts as an ionophore for small, monovalent cations (W. Epstein, unpublished).

## B. Influx Systems

### 1. THE Trk SYSTEM

The system found in the largest number of bacterial species, including several archaeal species, is a multicomponent complex referred to as Trk. These systems have a moderate affinity for K‚Å∫ in the vicinity of 1 mM, relatively high specificity for K‚Å∫, are generally expressed constitutively and are probably energized by taking up K‚Å∫ in symport with a proton.
knowledge of these systems is limited to characterization of the kinetics of transport *in vivo* and identification of the genes necessary to their activity; as yet there are no reports of Trk activity in vesicles.

The Trk system of *E. coli* is the one most extensively studied. The products of three different and unlinked genes are necessary for Trk activity in *E. coli* and similar enterics: *trkA*, *trkE*, and *trkH* (20,21). The corresponding genes in *S. typhimurium* are *sapG*, *sapD*, and *sapJ*, respectively (22). The *trkA* gene encodes a 458-residue peripheral membrane protein, the product of a gene-duplication event. The TrkA protein has a region similar to the dinucleotide fold of dehydrogenases, and TrkA binds NADH and NAD with higher affinity for NADH (23,24). The *trkE* gene, now often referred to as *sapD*, is one of the two ATP-binding components of an ABC transporter called Sap and first identified in *S. typhimurium* (25). This designation arose because the Sap transporter was proposed to transport toxic peptides. Subsequent studies indicate that *sapD* and other genes of the Trk system are required because restoration of internal K‚Å∫ is necessary to allow the cell to resist toxic peptides (26). The *trkH* gene is a 483-amino acid protein predicted to span the membrane 10 times, and thus is the component of Trk that forms the transmembrane-path component for K‚Å∫ movement (27).

The Trk system prefers K‚Å∫ over other monovalent cations. Cs‚Å∫ is not measurably transported (28), while Rb‚Å∫ is a substrate but with about a 10-fold lower rate of transport (29). External pH has little effect on the affinity of Trk for K‚Å∫, but the affinity for Rb‚Å∫ increases about 10-fold as the pH rises from 6.1 to 8.4 (30). Studies of energetics indicate that Trk activity requires both the proton-motive force (PMF) and ATP (31). The current view is that transport is driven by the PMF with one proton entering with one K‚Å∫ ion and that ATP has a regulatory role (32). The finding that the *trkE* (*sapD*) gene product is functional in mutant forms that are expected to bind ATP but not to hydrolyze it, supports the idea that ATP is regulatory and does not provide the energy to drive transport via Trk (33).

A complication, unique to some strains of *E. coli* K-12 that carry a defective prophage called *rac*, is the presence of TrkG, a second version of the transmembrane protein component of the Trk system. TrkG is very similar to TrkH, being 41% identical at the amino acid level, but its low GC content (37%) suggests an origin in some distant species of bacteria (34). TrkG replaces TrkH so that either product allows full Trk activity (21). The specificity of the system depends on which of these two membrane-spanning components is involved (27). However, when TrkG is present, Trk activity is only partially dependent on TrkE (21) although ATP is still required (33), suggesting that an ATP-binding component of some other ABC transporter can replace the role of TrkE (SapD) when TrkG is present. It is conceivable, if not very plausible, that TrkA is the component that binds ATP; failure to
detect binding of ATP to TrkA at submicromolar concentrations (24) does not exclude binding of ATP with modest affinity.

The Trk systems in other bacteria that have been studied seem to resemble that of *E. coli*. Introduction of a plasmid encoding the TrkA + TrkH components from *Vibrio alginolyticus* into *E. coli* results in a system that is totally independent of *sapD*, but does require ATP (33, 35). Thus, a third component that binds ATP, plausibly from some other ABC transporter, may be required for the *V. alginolyticus* Trk system. The thermophilic *Alicycobacillus acidocaldarius* (formerly *Bacillus acidocaldarius*) has a K‚Å∫-transport system whose kinetic properties resemble those of Trk (18).

K‚Å∫ uptake in the extreme halophiles, such as *Halobacterium halobium* and *Halofex volcanii*, is probably mediated by Trk-type systems, since there are homologs of *trk* genes in several of the archaea. This finding solves the confusion about how this class of organisms takes up and maintains such high internal concentrations of K‚Å∫. It had been suggested that uniport, uptake driven solely by the membrane potential, was sufficient (36), but the extent of accumulation is too high to be achieved by uniport (2, 37).

## 2. THE Ktr SYSTEM

A similar system, found in many bacteria but not seen in those archaea whose genomes have been sequenced, comprises two components, KtrA and KtrB (38). KtrA is a distant relative of TrkA while KtrB is distantly related to TrkH. KtrA is about half the size of TrkA, and thus probably evolved from a precursor common to Ktr and Trk; TrkA arose as a gene duplication of this precursor. KtrA, like TrkA, has a region whose sequence is homologous to the NAD-binding domain of some dehydrogenases. The Ktr system of *Vibrio alginolyticus* is Na‚Å∫ dependent (39), suggesting that it is energized by K‚Å∫ + Na‚Å∫ symport instead of the H‚Å∫ + K‚Å∫ symport inferred for the Trk system. Study of other Ktr systems is needed to determine if coupling to Na‚Å∫ is generally the case, or whether Ktr in marine organisms uses Na‚Å∫ while Ktr in nonmarine forms uses H‚Å∫ as the coupling ion.

A study of the KtrA protein from *B. subtilis* and a similar protein from *Methanococcus jannaschi*, both containing a NAD/NADH-binding domain, showed that they form tetramers in solution in the presence of either nucleotide but aggregate in the absence of nucleotide (40). A 136-residue fragment of the *B. subtilis* protein with bound NADH and a 144-residue fragment with bound NAD were crystallized and their structures solved to a resolution of 2.3 √Ö. NAD was bound somewhat differently from the binding of NADH. The authors suggest a conformational change depending on which form of NAD was bound, but it is also possible that each protein binds NAD or NADH in the same way and that binding to one protein is different from that to the other. Studies of the KtrA protein from *V. alginolyticus* suggest that

ATP binds to this subunit with much higher affinity than do NAD or NADH (M. Willenborg and E. P. Bakker, personal communication). If this is true for other KtrA proteins, they may not be sensing the redox state of the cell.

Plasmids expressing the *ktrA* and *ktrB* genes from *V. alginolyticus* mediate K<sup>+</sup> transport in *E. coli* independent of any *trk* gene of the host. This system transports Rb<sup>+</sup> at the same maximal rate as K<sup>+</sup>, but affinity for Rb<sup>+</sup> is about 5-fold lower. K<sup>+</sup> uptake in *Enterococcus hirae* (formerly *Streptococcus fecalis*) at modest K<sup>+</sup> concentrations is now known to be via one of two Ktr systems in this species (41). K<sup>+</sup> uptake in this organism requires both the PMF and ATP (42). However, since this organism can only generate a PMF from ATP via the F<sub>0</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase, it is unclear whether the ATP is required solely to generate a PMF or also has a direct role in transport.

*Bacillus subtilis* has two Ktr systems that were discovered through the similarity of their sequences to those in *V. alginolyticus* (19). These have been cloned and derivatives that lack one or both have been constructed. One of these systems, KtrAB, has rather high affinity for K<sup>+</sup> in the range of 1 mM while the KtrCD system has an apparent affinity of about 10 mM. When both are mutated, K<sup>+</sup> concentrations of 25 mM or higher are required to achieve growth. Expression of the systems is independent of medium K<sup>+</sup> concentration, but transcription of each is elevated when the other systems are abolished by mutation. Each system is important for adaptation to elevated osmolarity in media containing 2‚Äì4 mM K<sup>+</sup>; adaptation to high osmolarity is restored if medium K<sup>+</sup> concentration is suitably increased.

## 3. THE Kdp SYSTEM

The third system found in *E. coli* and many other bacteria is Kdp, an inducible system with high affinity and specificity for K<sup>+</sup> (see Ref. (13), for reviews see Refs. (43,44)). Reports of K<sup>+</sup> transporting ATPases in other bacteria (45,46) are most likely due to Kdp since this system is very widely distributed. Kdp is a P-type ATPase consisting of four subunits, all membrane proteins. KdpF is a small hydrophobic peptide probably important for stability and perhaps assembly but not essential for function (47). KdpA has 557 amino acid residues, crosses the membrane 10 times and is the subunit that binds and moves K<sup>+</sup> across the membrane (48,49). KdpB has 682 residues, is homologous to the large subunit of other P-type ATPases and has the highly conserved phosphorylation site (50). KdpC is a 190-residue protein with one predicted membrane span; one identified function of KdpC is in the assembly of the Kdp complex (51). Like other P-type ATPases, only ATP and a divalent cation are required; transport by Kdp is independent of the PMF (31). Measurements of a partial reaction of Kdp in black lipid membranes indicate
that K<sup>+</sup> uptake via Kdp is not associated with efflux of another ion since the activity is electrogenic (52). Kdp is expressed only when the cell‚Äôs need for K<sup>+</sup> is not satisfied by other transport systems, and thus serves to scavenge the ion when present at concentration too low to be efficiently taken up by the other K<sup>+</sup>-transport systems. Kdp becomes important for growth at higher K<sup>+</sup> concentrations when other K<sup>+</sup>-transport systems are abolished by mutation. Kdp is the only bacterial K<sup>+</sup>-transport system whose expression is strongly regulated at the transcriptional level, a topic considered in Section IV.

4. OTHER K<sup>+</sup>-UPTAKE SYSTEMS

A constitutive transport system of modest affinity and rate found in some bacteria is Kup, formerly TrkD. It is a single membrane protein of 622 amino acid residues and 12 predicted membrane spans, and has a large C-terminal soluble domain of 182 residues. It probably functions by proton symport (53) and is the only saturable system with reasonable affinity for Cs<sup>+</sup> (28). Kup activity is more important at low pH where its maximum rate exceeds that of Trk (54). Kup activity is inhibited at elevated osmolarity (Ref. (55), W. Epstein, unpublished observations).

Mutants in which all three saturable systems, Trk, Kup, and Kdp, are inactivated by mutation have residual K<sup>+</sup>-uptake activity referred to as TrkF (13). These mutants require about 25-mM K<sup>+</sup> to achieve half-maximal growth, and fail to grow in media containing less than about 10-mM K<sup>+</sup>. The rate of uptake by this system is virtually linear with external K<sup>+</sup> concentration. This activity requires the PMF but not ATP (31). Recent work suggests that this activity is due to illicit transport of K<sup>+</sup> by many different systems whose primary substrates are not K<sup>+</sup> (E. Buurman, J. Naprstek, D. McLaggan and W. Epstein, unpublished). Other examples of what is presumably illicit transport of K<sup>+</sup> have been reported (56,57). Complementation of the transport defect of such mutant strains by plasmids carrying foreign DNA has been used to isolate K<sup>+</sup>-transport systems in other bacteria and some eucaryotes.

A system of modest affinity for K<sup>+</sup> has been identified in *Enterococcus hirae* (58). This system seems to be essential for growth at very alkaline pH (pH 10) and has a modest affinity for K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>m</sub> = 20 mM) but a rate comparable to the Ktr systems in this organism. Since this system is saturable and has a rather high rate, it must be mediated by a system specific for K<sup>+</sup> and thus not an example of TrkF-like activity.

The *tetL* gene in *B. subtilis* and the *tetK* gene in a plasmid from *Staphylococcus aureus* encode tetracycline antiporters that can exchange various monovalent cations (59), and similar results have been reported for a divalent cation antiporter (60). When present on a multicopy plasmid, they partially complement mutants of *E. coli* lacking all saturable K<sup>+</sup>-uptake
systems, behavior suggesting that part of their activity represents illicit transport analogous to the TrkF activity in *E. coli*. When these two Tet transporters are expressed in vesicles, they mediate antiporter activities in which K‚Å∫ is a substrate (59). tetA(L)-deletion mutants of *B. subtilis* have reduced growth yields in media containing less than 10-mM K‚Å∫ (61). These data are difficult to reconcile with the observation that when the two Ktr systems of *B. subtilis* are deleted, no growth occurs below 20-mM K‚Å∫ (19). Since the loss of the Tet elements in *B. subtilis* reduced growth yields at intermediate K‚Å∫ concentrations, their primary role may be other than in K‚Å∫ transport. Growth of *B. subtilis* in limiting K‚Å∫ concentrations did not alter the kinetics of K‚Å∫ transport, implying that this species does not have a K‚Å∫-transport system induced by growth at low K‚Å∫ concentrations (W. Epstein, unpublished observations).

A K‚Å∫-stimulated ATPase induced by growth at low K‚Å∫ concentrations and inhibited by low concentrations of vanadate has been described in *B. subtilis* (62), but there is as yet no evidence that this activity is involved in K‚Å∫ transport.

### C. Efflux Systems

Energetic and physiologic considerations predict specific systems mediating efflux of K‚Å∫ will be found in almost all bacteria. One argument, an energetic one, is based on the high electrical membrane potential, interior negative, maintained by bacteria growing in neutral and alkaline media. This potential will tend to accumulate K‚Å∫ through leakage paths until the K‚Å∫ gradient is in equilibrium with membrane potential. This is the presumed mechanism of TrkF activity described above. A membrane potential of ‚àí120 mV would concentrate K‚Å∫ and other monovalent cations 100-fold; if the external concentration is 20 mM the cell would have 2 M K‚Å∫ at equilibrium, a situation not compatible with growth of most bacteria. This type of consideration led Mitchell to predict the existence of proton/cation antiporters to avoid inhibition by excess accumulation of cations (63). Most bacteria grow well in media of elevated K‚Å∫ concentration, so an energy-coupled efflux system must be present to prevent excessive accumulation of K‚Å∫. Acidophiles that have a reversed membrane potential, interior positive, by contrast need to protect themselves from anion flooding and thus must have anion-exporting systems.

A second argument is based on the requirement of bacteria to reduce their K‚Å∫ content when turgor is dangerously high, as in a reduction of medium osmolarity referred to as osmotic downshock or simply downshock here. Gradual K‚Å∫ efflux is seen when medium osmolarity is progressively diluted (64) or when cells at high osmolarity are supplied with compatible solutes whose uptake requires loss of cell K‚Å∫ to avoid excessive levels of turgor (65).

Very rapid efflux of K‚Å∫ produced by sudden downshock is surely mediated by mechanosensitive channels considered in Section II.C, but paths of K‚Å∫ efflux when turgor rises more slowly remain to be identified. Paths more specific than the channels are likely since efflux under these conditions appears to be rather specific.

The only well-characterized K‚Å∫-efflux systems in *E. coli* are the KefB and KefC systems. Homologous systems are found in many Gram-negative bacteria but not in any Gram-positive bacteria (66). The activity of these systems is manifested by the rapid but reversible loss of K‚Å∫ when cells were treated with N-ethylmaleimide (67, 68). The major effect is an exchange of K‚Å∫ for H‚Å∫ (69). Each of these systems consists of a large protein with an N-terminal region that has 12 predicted membrane spans and a larger C-terminal domain, probably cytoplasmic, that has a nucleotide-binding region (70). The C-terminal domain does not have homology to glutathione-binding proteins as reported earlier; there was an error in the reported sequence of the glutathione-binding protein (I. R. Booth, personal communication). Each of these two systems has, in addition, a smaller ancillary soluble protein, YheR and YabF, each encoded by genes adjacent to *kefB* and *kefC*, respectively. YheR and YabF have sequence similarity to some dehydrogenases. In the absence of the ancillary proteins, the systems have very low activity (71). Regulation of the activity of the KefB and KefC systems by glutathione adducts and potential regulation by the redox state of the cell is discussed in Section II.B.

K‚Å∫/H‚Å∫ antiporters are ideal candidates to mediate K‚Å∫ efflux, and such activity is probably present in virtually all bacteria. K‚Å∫/H‚Å∫ activity has been demonstrated in *E. coli* (72). This activity has moderate affinity for K‚Å∫, *K*‚Çò of about 2.5 mM, and low substrate specificity since Na‚Å∫, Li‚Å∫, and Rb‚Å∫ compete with K‚Å∫. A mutant lacking such activity has been isolated; its only apparent defect was inability to grow at high osmolarity and high pH (73). A mutant of *E. hirae* has been isolated that is totally defective in K‚Å∫/H‚Å∫ antiport activity at pH 9.5, does not properly regulate internal pH above 8 and does not grow above pH 9 (74). These data suggest that bacteria may, in general, have two or more antiporters, each operating optimally over a different range of medium pH. This pattern resembles that of the two major Na‚Å∫/H‚Å∫ antiporters of *E. coli*, which are active over different ranges of pH (75).

An activity that exchanges K‚Å∫ for methylammonium and which is competitively inhibited by NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫ and Tl‚Å∫, but noncompetitively inhibited by K‚Å∫ has been characterized in *E. coli* (76). Similar activities have been reported in a thermophile (18) and a methanogen (77). Nothing is known about the genetics or physiological function of these exchange activities; they may reflect the activity of an NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫-transport system.

D. Channels

Bacteria have several types of channels with properties similar to those of eucaryotic cells. Only brief consideration of channels will be dealt with here, since they seem to have only a minor role in the way bacteria deal with K‚Å∫. There have been suggestions that some of the systems considered here under the heading of transport systems are channels, but evidence of channel activity of any of these systems remains to be demonstrated. Bacterial channels are the subjects of a recent review (78).

Two bacterial K‚Å∫ channels have been characterized and a gene that encodes a bacterial homolog of eucaryotic channels has been identified. The *Streptomyces lividans* KcsA channel and the *Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum* MthK channel have been purified, crystallized, and their structures determined with a resolution of 3.2 and 3.3 √Ö, respectively (79,80). The former channel appears to be gated by protons while the latter is Ca¬≤‚Å∫ gated. Studies of the ionic preference of the KcsA channel show that it has highest conductance for K‚Å∫, somewhat lower conductance for similar ions Rb‚Å∫, Tl‚Å∫, and NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫, and over 1000-fold lower conductance for Na‚Å∫, Li‚Å∫, and Cs‚Å∫ (81). The MthK channel is reported to prefer K‚Å∫ to Na‚Å∫ (80). The KcsA structure has served as a model for the many ion channels of eucaryotic cells.

The *kch* gene of *E. coli* encodes a protein homologous to eucaryotic K‚Å∫ channels (82). There are homologs of this gene in many other bacteria. The Kch protein does not appear to form functional channels in vesicles or lipid bilayers under conditions tested so far since no reports of channel activity of the Kch protein have appeared. Although the *kch* gene is expressed (78), deletion of the gene has no detectable phenotype (E. Buurman and W. Epstein, unpublished observations). Overexpression of Kch in wild-type *E. coli* results in growth inhibition in media of moderate K‚Å∫ concentration (83). Inhibition is overcome by K‚Å∫ or several congeners, NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫, Cs‚Å∫, or Rb‚Å∫, when present at 30‚Äì90 mM concentration. Na‚Å∫ does not reverse the inhibition. The Kch protein did not form channels when expressed in oocytes, nor did chimeras in which the pore region of Kch was introduced into the Shaker channel or vice versa. Inhibition at moderate but not high-medium K‚Å∫ concentrations implies that Kch does not form a channel of the usual sort. These data are more consistent with an electrically neutral process, symport of K‚Å∫ with an anion, or exchange of K‚Å∫ for protons or some other cation.

The physiological roles of the bacterial K‚Å∫ channels are not known. The frequent openings and closings of the KcsA channel is typical of channels, but what function that would serve is unclear. Brief openings would tend to bring the membrane potential toward the equilibrium potential for K‚Å∫, but

since it also conducts NH${}_{4}^{+}$ it could lead to accumulation of the latter. Physiologic studies of strains in which KcsA or MthK are deleted might be informative. Studies of $kch$-deletion mutants have not been informative so far.

The mechanosensitive channels of bacteria open when their threshold pressure is exceeded, allowing efflux of a relatively nonspecific group of molecules, selected on the basis of size and to some extent by charge. Since rapid efflux of K${}^{+}$ and other osmotic solutes is necessary to avoid cell rupture upon sudden osmotic downshock, these types of channels are an important if nonspecific path for K${}^{+}$ efflux. Three types of channels have been identified in *E. coli*: MscL, MscS, and MscM, encoding channels of large, medium, and small diameter. The pressure to open the channels increases with the size of the channel opening.

The MscL channel has been crystallized from *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and found to be pentameric with an estimated diameter in the open state of about 40 √Ö which should allow proteins of 40,000‚Äì70,000 Da to pass (84). There are two MscS channels; the major one, encoded by the *mscS* (former *yggB*) gene, is a 286-amino acid protein with three membrane spans. This MscS channel has also been crystallized to a resolution of 3.9 √Ö (85). The protein is a heptamer with, as predicted from the sequence, three membrane spans in each monomer. The *kefA* gene encodes an 1120-amino acid protein, of which a region toward the C-terminus is very similar to MscS. Channel activity of KefA, also called MscK, is dependent on external K${}^{+}$ (86). The wild-type channel opens only by pressure and only when high concentrations of external K${}^{+}$ are present, while the *kefA2* mutant channel opens spontaneously in the presence of external K${}^{+}$ but with pressure whether K${}^{+}$ is present or not. The *kefA2* mutant channel opens at a lower pressure than does the wild type (86,87). Growth of *kefA2* mutants is inhibited in the presence of high external K${}^{+}$ and betaine (88). Efflux via bacterial-mechanosensitive channels is inhibited by Gd${}^{3+}$ (89) as is true of eucaryotic-mechanosensitive channels.

The presumed role of mechanosensitive channels, to protect the cells from cell rupture upon sudden osmotic downshock, has been confirmed. After osmotic downshock, mutants lacking both MscL and MscS have a survival of somewhat under 10% while over 90% of wild-type cells survive (90). Cells lacking only MscL or only MscS survive as well as the wild type after downshock. The MscS and the MscK channels have similar properties *in vitro*, but loss of the MscK channel has little effect and its presence is not protective. Curiously, even in the presence of high external K${}^{+}$, the MscK channel is not protective (I. R. Booth, personal communication).

# II. Regulation of K‚Å∫ Transport Systems

## A. Control of Activity of Influx Systems

Over half a century ago, it was reported that increasing the osmolarity of the medium, osmotic upshock, resulted in net K uptake by *E. coli* (91). This response to upshock may be universal since it is seen in diverse species (92‚Äì97). This response is crucial to many other effects of upshock discussed in the following sections, since they seem to be triggered by increased internal K‚Å∫ or some effect dependent on uptake of K‚Å∫.

Kinetic analyses of the Trk system of *E. coli* show that K‚Å∫ uptake at a maximum rate begins without measurable lag (<5 s) after osmotic upshock (Ref. (92), W. Epstein, unpublished observations). Net uptake is due to a stimulation of influx; exchange of external for internal K‚Å∫ continues unaltered after upshock (64). The rate of uptake is maximal with osmotic shifts of 0.2 osM and higher (64,92). A similar but quantitatively smaller effect is mediated by the Kdp system. Similar studies have not been reported for the Kup system. In strains that have only the residual TrkF activity, osmotic upshock results in net K‚Å∫ uptake, but here the effect appears to be an inhibition of efflux (64). The stimulus that produced net uptake of K‚Å∫ in response to osmotic upshock was suggested to be a reduction in turgor (92,98). This model explains the transient nature of the increase in the rate of uptake, since once turgor was restored there would be no net uptake of K‚Å∫. This model also accounts for the maintenance of a constant internal pool of K‚Å∫ during growth, in that turgor is assumed to be slightly suboptimal during growth to produce a slight stimulation of net K‚Å∫ uptake sufficient to meet the needs during growth. Once growth stops, turgor rises slightly to the point where net K‚Å∫ uptake ceases (98).

Each of the K‚Å∫-transport activities identified in *E. coli* is sensitive to the ionic environment. The Trk system is maximally active in cells that are K depleted. The depleted cells have increased cell Na‚Å∫ and probably lower internal pH, but neither can account for a high rate of transport, since low pH is inhibitory (99) while internal Na‚Å∫ does not appear to be very stimulating (14). Kdp activity is strongly but reversibly inhibited by external K‚Å∫ concentrations above 0.1 mM (92). Such inhibition may account at least in part for reduced growth rates in media containing 10‚Äì40 mM K‚Å∫ of strains expressing only Kdp (16,100). TrkF activity, probably a mixture of paths, exhibits transstimulation, being higher in cells that are loaded with K‚Å∫ than in K‚Å∫-depleted cells (92). Transstimulation might be indirect since K‚Å∫-depleted cells may have a somewhat lower membrane potential, the presumed driving force for TrkF activity.

B. Control of Activity of Efflux Systems

The only K<sup>+</sup>-specific efflux systems whose control has been studied are the KefB and KefC systems, each composed of a membrane protein and a soluble protein as described earlier. These systems seem to serve primarily as emergency systems to deal with the onslaught of certain toxic compounds. Compounds that activate these systems react with glutathione to create adducts, and certain of these adducts activate the systems. Once activated, K<sup>+</sup> release by the systems acidifies the cytoplasm. Acidification does not accelerate the inactivation of toxins (reviewed in Ref. (66)). Instead, it appears to reduce the rate at which the toxins create lethal lesions, an effect demonstrated for the attack of DNA by methylglyoxal (101). Both KefB and KefC seem to be inactive in the absence of the toxins that activate them; strains deleted for both are abnormal only in their hypersensitivity to these toxins (65). Mutations that cause them to be active in the absence of toxins identify regions of the proteins important in control of their activity (13,102). The similarity of the nucleotide-binding site of the KefC protein to those of the TrkA/KtrA class of proteins suggests a similar mode of interaction and possible regulation by NAD(H) (40).

C. Control of Expression

The only K<sup>+</sup>-uptake system whose expression is closely regulated at the transcriptional level is Kdp. It appears to be inducible in all strains in which its expression has been examined (103‚Äì107). Control is mediated by the KdpD sensor kinase and the KdpE-response regulator proteins. In *E. coli* the two regulators are encoded by an operon that overlaps the operon encoding the structural components of Kdp (108), but different arrangements are found in distantly related bacteria (109). In some bacteria only part of the *kdpD* gene is near to the other *kdp* genes; genes encoding KdpE and the missing fragment of KdpD must be elsewhere. KdpD function can occur by complementation of separately encoded N- and C-terminal fragments of the *E. coli* gene (110) as well as by a chimeric protein combining the 365-residue KdpD protein of Anabaena with a large C-terminal fragment of *E. coli* that includes the membrane spans (109).

Control of Kdp in *E. coli* has been extensively studied and is the subject of some controversy. KdpD is a 94-kDa protein with four closely spaced membrane spans separating two cytoplasmic domains of almost equal size (108,111), while KdpE is a 21-kDa soluble protein. *In vitro* studies confirm the role of phosphate in Kdp regulation: KdpD is autophosphorylated on what is probably a histidine residue, the phosphate is transferred to form the phosphorylated form of KdpE, P-KdpE, probably on an aspartate residue, and ultimately KdpD acts as phosphatase to remove phosphate from P-KdpE.
The C-terminal half of KdpD is the kinase domain, while the N-terminal domain is unique. There is an ATP-binding site in the N-terminal domain which seems to have an important role in signaling by KdpD, and a set of basic residues early in the C-terminal domain that are also found in homologs although neither the specific residues nor their precise location are conserved (112). KdpD acts as a dimer (113), and it seems that P-KdpE is also a dimer (M. Lucassin, cited in Ref. (114)). All current ideas about the regulation of Kdp assume that only KdpD and KdpE are involved, since no other mutations that radically alter regulation of Kdp have been reported. Insertion mutations in the *hns* and in *trxB* genes, encoding the H-NS nucleoid protein and thioredoxin reductase, respectively, reduce the threshold concentration below which Kdp is expressed (115). The mutations also reduced expression slightly when tested in a strain with two *kdpD* mutations that made expression constitutive; there was no reduction with a different *kdpD* mutation. These results are consistent with effects on the KdpD and/or KdpE proteins, but also with some steps upstream of these regulatory proteins. A trivial explanation, that these mutations increase uptake of compatible solutes or of K‚Å∫, was not tested. Other proteins may be directly involved in regulation of Kdp expression. However, if these proteins have other functions essential to survival, they would be rarely found in a screen for constitutive or nonexpressing mutants.

It was early noted that Kdp is only expressed when the growth rate of the strain became limited by the K‚Å∫ concentration of the medium (13,103). This observation has been confirmed under a variety of conditions (116,117). The few reported exceptions are based on incomplete data, where sufficiently low K‚Å∫ concentrations were not tested because complex medium containing about 7 mM K‚Å∫ was used (118,119). The specific signal to turn on Kdp was suggested to be low turgor (103). The role of turgor was supported by finding that upshock resulted in a transient expression of Kdp which terminated when the new cellular K‚Å∫ concentration was reached which presumably restored normal turgor. Since turgor cannot be measured very well in *E. coli* or most other bacteria, this model cannot be tested rigorously.

A number of alternative models for control of Kdp have been suggested. Some *in vivo* data has been used to suggest a key role for the movement of K‚Å∫ across the cell membrane (117), while studies of purified KdpD reconstituted in vesicles suggest control by internal K‚Å∫ (summarized in Ref. (114)). None of these models fit very well with the control of Kdp seen *in vivo*. Regulation of Kdp is independent of which K‚Å∫-transport system is present and of any particular K‚Å∫ concentration inside or outside, indicating that neither a specific range of K‚Å∫ concentrations nor K‚Å∫ fluxes through any of the known systems are involved (103,116). A specific role for salts has been suggested, based on the observation that an osmotic challenge by a salt was much more
effective in turning on expression of Kdp than an equivalent challenge with a sugar (120). This effect is due to an unexplained effect of salts, as compared to sugars, on the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-concentration dependence of growth in strains expressing the Trk system (116). Whether in the presence of high concentrations of salts or of sugars, Kdp expression begins at the point where the growth rate becomes limited by medium $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ concentration.

In an *in vitro* system in which KdpD is oriented in an inside-out orientation, KdpD activity in phosphorylating KdpE from ATP was stimulated by increased KCl or NaCl on the cytoplasmic surface, but little if at all when these salts were present at the periplasmic surface (121). A somewhat different *in vitro* system, in which the orientation is the same as in intact cells, found inhibition of KdpD phosphorylation by $\mathrm{K}^{+}$; however, inhibition is saturated at concentrations of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ lower than are found in the cell (122). Inhibition of Kdp expression by elevated internal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ could not explain how Kdp expression is off when growing in media where internal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ is low. The analysis of constitutive mutants has suggested that it is dephosphorylation of P-KdpE that is inhibited to turn on Kdp *in vivo*, rather than stimulation of the phosphorylation of KdpD or transfer of the phosphate to KdpE (123).

The four transmembrane segments of KdpD are believed to be crucial to physiological regulation of Kdp. Deletions of all four membranes was reported to result in a moderately active enzyme which did not respond to environmental signals (124) or in an inactive protein (125). A recent report shows that deletions of some or all of the segments impairs but does not abolish regulation totally (126). A deletion of all four membrane segments exhibits high expression in media of low $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ concentration, which falls by a factor of 4 at high $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ concentrations. Since the protein lacking membrane spans could not sense turgor, this effect must be mediated by the cytoplasmic parts of KdpD, which could be responding to changes in internal pH, internal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, or other factors. Since the deletion mutant mediates only a 4-fold change in expression, while in the wild type there is a 500- to 1000-fold change (116), the residual regulation expressed in the deletion mutant may not reflect the key factor or factors that mediate regulation *in vivo*. Any model for control ought to allow for an effect of the cytoplasmic environment, including but not limited to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and pH, in modulating the response. The *in vivo* data (103,116) argue very strongly that internal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ is not the primary signal controlling Kdp expression.

All of the major $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-uptake systems of moderate affinity appear to be expressed constitutively so that control is expressed at the level of activity. One exception to this pattern has been reported. In *B. subtilis* inactivation of one of the two Ktr systems leads to greatly increased expression of the other system (19). This effect is not due to a response to altered $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ levels in the

cell, since expression of each was not altered when growth became limited by external K‚Å∫.

# III. K as an Intracellular Activator

The fact that uptake of K‚Å∫ is probably the earliest response to osmotic upshock suggested that a rise in internal K‚Å∫ might serve as a signal for osmotic stress sensed as a reduction in turgor (98,127). Osmotic upshock raises internal K‚Å∫ concentration, or more correctly K‚Å∫ activity, in less than a second by causing water to leave the cell due to the elasticity of the cell wall and at greater degrees of upshock by producing plasmolysis (reviewed in Ref. (98)). Although this effect has been suggested to explain the need for K‚Å∫ in the responses to upshock (128), this cannot be correct since K‚Å∫ uptake is required. The resulting uptake of K‚Å∫, which requires only a minute or two in some bacteria but is considerably slower in others, allows a partial restoration of cell water and a direct increase in K‚Å∫ concentration in the cell. Most responses to upshock are permanent and depend on the final medium osmolarity, very different from the effect of upshock on expression of Kdp, which is transient if other transport systems can maintain turgor at the new, higher osmolarity.

This chapter will stress only very recent data on the role of K‚Å∫ in activating transport systems in response to osmotic stress since this topic and the roles of K‚Å∫ in increasing expression of some genes has been the subject of several recent reviews (128‚Äì133). This role of K‚Å∫ was first demonstrated for the ProU system of S. typhimurium, a system whose expression is increased several hundred fold after shift to elevated osmolarity (120). Uptake of K‚Å∫ was found essential; the increase due to reduced cell water alone did not cause elevated expression of the ProU system. There is general agreement that virtually all the bacterial responses to elevated osmolarity require an increase of cytoplasmic K‚Å∫, but until recently the specific way K‚Å∫ produced the responses was not clear. A direct mechanistic model has the concentration (activity) of K‚Å∫ in the cytoplasm act directly on the system involved to activate or stimulate expression; a more general version would implicate ionic strength in the cytoplasm instead of being specific for K‚Å∫. Alternative models would implicate some ‚Äúadaptor‚Äù function, a protein or other cell component that reacts to increased K‚Å∫ and mediates its effects.

In vitro systems, in which purified transport systems for compatible solutes are incorporated into vesicles, has allowed direct tests of the role of K‚Å∫ and other solutes in activating transport systems. The BetP glycine betaine transporter of C. glutamicum when incorporated into vesicles prepared with E. coli phospholipids was stimulated when internal K‚Å∫ or Rb‚Å∫ or Cs‚Å∫, used
as their phosphate salts, rose to levels above about 220 mM, while choline or NH${}_{4}^{+}$ were not stimulatory (96). When K${}^{+}$ glutamate was used as the internal solvent, results were very similar although the extent of activation was slightly reduced. Specific effects of Na${}^{+}$ could not be tested since a gradient of this ion is needed to energize BetP. Earlier work in which extramembranous regions of BetP were deleted showed that loss of 23 residues at the C-terminus abolished response to osmotic stimuli although the protein was active, albeit with lower activity and moderately reduced affinity for Na${}^{+}$ (134). These results implicate that K${}^{+}$ itself or a very similar ion interacts with the C-terminal tail of BetP to control its activity. Although the topology of the protein has not been established, it is likely that this C-terminal region is cytoplasmic.

Similar studies of the ProP transporter of *E. coli* have reached somewhat similar conclusions. *In vivo* ProP activity is activated rapidly, achieving and then maintaining its maximal rate within about a minute after osmotic upshock (135). The purified ProP protein was studied after reconstitution into vesicles in the absence of ProQ (136). The activity of ProP is increased about 6-fold in the presence of the soluble ProQ protein *in vivo*. Activation occurred when the vesicles were shrunk by increasing external osmolality with either NaCl or glucose. Half-maximal activation occurred when the internal cation was calculated to have reached about 0.35 M; K-phosphate, NaCl, KCl, CsCl, and LiCl all seemed equally effective in activation. When larger polyethylene glycols were added, the salt concentration for half-maximal activation fell to about 0.25 M. The data confirm that normally monovalent cation concentration is activating. The basis of the effect of polyethylene glycols is not clear. These compounds sequester water so that at least part of their effect is to reduce free water and thereby increase the activity of K${}^{+}$ well above the calculated value. The study suggests that these compounds do not sequester sufficient water to explain their total effect, but the calculations of sequestration based on literature values of specific volumes may underestimate the sequestering effect. A direct effect of polyethylene glycols on ProP is possible.

The OpuA glycine betaine transporter of *Lactobacillus lactis* is 7-fold more active at high than at low osmolality (137). OpuA is a two-component ABC transporter that was energized in vesicles by incorporating an ATP-generating system within the vesicles where its activity was stimulated 5-fold by high external osmolality (138). The finding, not infrequent for membrane proteins, that the amphipathic anesthetic tetracaine altered the behavior of OpuA led to the suggestion that alterations in the membrane mediated regulation of OpuA by medium osmolarity. A subsequent study shows that the activity of OpuA in liposomes depends on the presence of at least 25% anionic lipids and that activation requires elevated internal ionic strength since K${}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ salts are equally effective (139). The authors infer that the anionic lipids mediate the effect of internal ionic strength, that they transmit the ionic signal to OpuA.

It is well known that membrane-transport systems and enzymes are sensitive to the lipid environment (reviewed in Refs. (140,141)). The fact that anionic lipids are required by OpuA could be due to a requirement of this lipid for stabilization or proper incorporation of the OpuA transporter in the membrane rather than any direct role in activation. Note that the KcsA channel also requires anionic lipids, yet no one would argue that it is the lipids that recognize or assist $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ in getting into the channel (142). The data available does not identify the location of the ionic strength sensor for the OpuA system. Studies of OpuA mutants may help in identifying which regions of which components sense internal ionic strength.

# IV. Regulation of Internal pH by $\mathrm{K}^{+}$

To control the pH of the cytoplasm, cells must displace protons from the various buffer anions in the cell. The major buffer anions are the phosphate groups of nucleic acids and those charged residues in proteins whose pK is near the pH of the cytoplasm. To do this, the cell must use some other monovalent cation, and since $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ is the major cellular cation it has a primary role in this process. Thus, one of the parameters that must control $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ movements is cytoplasmic pH, but exactly how this is done is not very well understood. Since this topic is the subject of reviews (143,144) only brief consideration is given here.

In the steady state, one assumes that cellular buffer anions are constant so that exchanges of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ would be the primary way internal pH can be altered. Yet there is only superficial understanding of the $\mathrm{K}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$ antiporters in the neutrophilic organisms, *E. coli* and *S. typhimurium*, whose physiology is best understood. In fact, we must turn to the $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$ antiporters to get a glimpse of how such activities are regulated (75). There are two such activities in *E. coli*, differing in the pH range over which they are active and in their stoichiometry. The task is divided between one activity active in alkaline environments and another active in acidic environments. These activities are surely important in controlling cellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ but may be only minor players in maintaining the internal pH of a neutrophile such as *E. coli*.

A $\mathrm{K}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$ antiporter in *E. hirae* active in media of alkaline pH has been inferred to reduce internal pH when internal pH was increased by the presence of high concentrations of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ (74). This activity has a 1:1 stoichiometry of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ under the conditions studied, indicating that the outwardly directed gradient of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ is sufficient to drive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ accumulation.The role of $\mathrm{K}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$ antiporters in regulation of pH when in an alkaline environment is confirmed by the failure of antiporter mutants in *E. coli* and *E. hirae* to grow in media above about pH 9 (73,74).

In *E. coli*, the only well-studied antiporters are the KefB and KefC activities. However, these act to acidify the cytoplasm only when activated by toxins and are probably not involved in regulating internal pH under other conditions. Internal pH in *E. coli* is somewhat dependent on the specific $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-transport system present (145). Internal pH was about 7.7 when the Trk system predominated, but rose to about 8.0 when the Kdp system was active. This small difference in internal pH results in increased sensitivity to the toxins that activate the KefB/KefC activities. That a rather small change in internal pH could significantly alter sensitivity to toxins is supported by the fact that when KefB/KefC activities reduce sensitivity to the toxins, they do so by reducing internal pH from 7.7 to 7.4, also a change of only 0.3 pH units (66). The difference in internal pH may be due to the difference in mechanisms of the two systems. Trk should tend to increase internal pH since it is inferred to be a $\mathrm{K}^{+}-\mathrm{H}^{+}$ symporter while Kdp is an electrogenic ATP-driven system that would tend to displace cytoplasmic $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

# V. Future Directions

There are still many important questions about the role of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, not to speak of so many other aspects of bacterial metabolism that remain to be established. Many important systems, such as $\mathrm{K}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$ antiporters, are poorly understood and their genes in the commonly studied bacteria have yet to be identified. The hope that complete genome sequences will greatly speed our understanding has not been fully realized. The utility of these sequences are greatest when a gene not previously identified is homologous to genes of known or suspected function in other species. However, there are still many putative genes, now just open-reading frame, whose function is not known.

The function of an open-reading frame may be determined in strains in each of which one putative gene has been deleted or otherwise inactivated. This is potentially a good route, except that unless one has an idea of the function of the gene the screen used may not detect the function that has been lost. Just to cite one example, inactivation of any of the known $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-transport systems in *E. coli* would not have been detected by any ordinary screen. An approach that is generally more productive is to start with a mutant in a function, since determining the gene affected is relatively easy given all the tools now available.

Studies of cellular systems in simplified, *in vitro* systems have been essential to a full understanding of enzymes, and today are almost requisite fora full understanding of transport systems and how they are regulated. It is well to remember, however, that *in vitro* results must always be compared to data of function *in vivo*, since the *in vitro* conditions at best approach but are almost never identical to those *in vivo*.
