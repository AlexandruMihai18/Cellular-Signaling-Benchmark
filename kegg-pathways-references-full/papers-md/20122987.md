ABSTRACT

Thyroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin and subsequent oxidative coupling of iodinated tyrosyl residues to protein-bound iodothyronines are the key reactions in thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Under sufficient iodine supply, both synthesis steps are rate-limited by the availability of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), which is required as final electron acceptor. The primary enzyme feeding H₂O₂ to thyroid peroxidase is a heterodimeric NADPH oxidase complex of dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) and DUOX maturation factor 2 (DUOXA2) at the apical plasma membrane. While the thyrotropin receptor mediates most biological effects through the Gs/adenyl cyclase/cAMP pathway, the Gq/phospholipase C-β cascade induces H₂O₂ generation via synergistic effects of increased intracellular calcium and protein kinase C activation on DUOX2/DUOXA2. Defects in thyroidal H₂O₂ generation have been identified in a subset of patients with congenital hypothyroidism. These include loss-of-function mutations in DUOX2 and DUOXA2. Thyrotropin receptor mutations with preferential loss of Gq-coupling may indirectly affect H₂O₂ production. Expressivity of the defects can be highly variable owning to the presence of genetic modifiers (e.g., the paralogs DUOX1 and DUOXA1), and environmental factors particularly nutritional iodide intake.

control has significance for not only the coupling of iodinated tyrosine but also iodination.

Early biochemical studies showed that the enzyme feeding H₂O₂ to TPO is a membrane-bound NADPH dependent flavoprotein (Bjorkman and Ekholm, 1984; Virion et al., 1984; Deme et al., 1985; Nakamura et al., 1987; Dupuy et al., 1989; Gorin et al., 1996; Leseney et al., 1999). The prototype of this class of enzymes is the phagosomal NADPH oxidase NOX2 (gp91phox) of leukocytes, which, during engulfment of invading microbes, transfers electrons from NADPH across the membrane to molecular oxygen thereby generating superoxide anions (O₂⁻). Even though thyroidal H₂O₂ could result from spontaneous O₂⁻ dismutation, no detectable O₂⁻ intermediate is released from thyroid cells under physiological conditions (Dupuy et al., 1989).

It took 15 years from the initial biochemical characterization to the cloning of the dual oxidases (DUOX; originally called thyroid oxidases or THOX), which constitute the catalytic core of the thyroidal H₂O₂ generator. They were identified by purification and partial sequencing of a thyroidal NADPH oxidase flavoprotein (Dupuy et al., 1999) and via screening of a thyroid cDNA library for homologs of NOX2 (De Deken et al., 2000). The predicted amino acid sequences of the two DUOX paralogs (DUOX1: 1551 amino acids; DUOX2: 1548 amino acids) share 83% sequence similarity. They are expressed as fully glycosylated forms (~190 kDa) found at the apical plasma membrane and as high mannose glycosylated forms (180 kDa) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (De Deken et al., 2002; Morand et al., 2003).

The C-terminal region (~50% similarity with NOX2 over 569 amino acids) comprises six α-helical transmembrane segments harboring four invariant histidines, which are considered coordination sites for two nonidentical heme prosthetic groups, and a C-terminal cytosolic domain containing flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and NADPH-binding sites. This arrangement of prosthetic groups provides an electron transport chain for transferring electrons from NADPH across the membrane (Fig. 1). In addition to the NOX2 homolog region, DUOX proteins feature an ecto-facing N-terminal peroxidase-like domain (hence named *dual* oxidases). It precedes a membrane-spanning segment and an additional cytosolic domain containing two EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. Whereas calcium reversibly activates the thyroidal H₂O₂ generator, limited proteolysis with α-chymotrypsin renders the enzyme fully active independently of calcium (Dupuy et al., 1992). It is thus possible that the EF-hands provide autoinhibition of DUOX by interfering with the function of the C-terminal NOX2 homolog domain. Binding of calcium (reversibly) and proteolytic removal of the autoinhibitory domain (irreversibly) would remove the constraint by inducing a conformational change.

DUOX differ from other essential factors in the conserved thyroid hormone biosynthesis pathway (e.g., TG and TPO) in two important ways. First, although both DUOX genes are highly expressed in follicular thyroid cells, their expression is not restricted to thyroid but rather is epithelial cell specific. For instance, in humans and other mammals, high level of DUOX2 expression are found in polarized epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa (El Hassani et al., 2005; Geiszt et al., 2003) and both DUOX are expressed in ciliated airway epithelium (Forteza et al., 2005; Geiszt et al., 2003; Schwarzer et al., 2004). Secondly, DUOX homologs are evolutionary old molecules found in invertebrates lacking a follicular thyroid or an endostyle thyroid equivalent (e.g., in *Drosophila* (Ha et al., 2005) and *C. elegans* (Edens et al., 2001)). Exposure to various pathogens clearly indicates an important function of *Drosophila* DUOX in barrier defense of the gastrointestinal mucosa. Whether vertebrate DUOXs play a similar role in host defense has not been investigated in any *in vivo* model system. Such a role would, however, be consistent with the induction of DUOX in response to inflammatory mediators, e.g., the induction of DUOX1 by interleukins 4 and 13, and of DUOX2 by interferon-γ in respiratory tract epithelium (Harper et al., 2005).

Although DUOX sequences contain all features compatible with calcium-stimulated NADPH oxidases, initial molecular studies of

Fig. 1. The thyroidal H₂O₂-generating system. A heterodimeric DUOX2/DUOXA2 complex provides H₂O₂ for all TPO-catalyzed thyroid hormone synthesis steps. The latter include iodide oxidation and organification (binding to tyrosine residues of TG), and the subsequent coupling of mono- and di-iodinated tyrosines to iodothyronines (thyroid hormones). Stimulation of organification by TSH depends on activation of Gq linked signaling cascades leading to increased intracellular calcium (via PLC-β/IP₃) and PKC activation (via PLC-β/diacylglycerol). Calcium and PKC act synergistically in the activation of the DUOX2/DUOXA2 enzyme complex. Note that for clarity, the less expressed DUOX1 and DUOXA1 paralogs are not shown.
DUOX proteins had been hampered by the failure to reconstitute active DUOX enzymes in heterologous systems, because recombinant DUOX was completely retained inside the ER in an immature form (Ameziane-El-Hassani et al., 2005; De Deken et al., 2002; Morand et al., 2003, 2004; Wang et al., 2005). We found that reconstitution of a DUOX-based H₂O₂ generator indeed requires the formation of a heterodimeric complex of DUOX with another multipass transmembrane protein, dual oxidase maturation factor (DUOXA) (Fig. 1). The two human DUOXA paralogs were identified as novel thyroid-specific expressed genes by *in silico* screening of multiple parallel signature sequencing expression data (Grasberger and Refetoff, 2006). Although the predicted DUOXA amino acid sequences share no similarity to other characterized proteins, genomic mapping of the DUOXA genes provided a clue to their function: the DUOX and DUOXA genes are contiguous on the long arm of chromosome 15. Each of the two DUOXA genes shares the core of a bidirectionally active promoter with one of the DUOX genes. The evolutionary conserved genetic linkage of DUOX1/DUOXA1 and DUOX2/DUOXA2 into transcriptional units provides the basis for strict coexpression of each DUOX with the corresponding maturation factor (Grasberger and Refetoff, 2006; Fischer et al., 2007; Luxen et al., 2008).

The dimerization of a DUOX with a DUOXA protein enables ER exit and trafficking of the complex through the secretory pathway to the cell surface. Only DUOX1/DUOXA1 and DUOX2/DUOXA2 complexes appear to be fully functional *in vitro* (Zamproni et al., 2008; Morand et al., 2009). The less stable DUOX2/DUOXA1 and DUOX1/DUOXA2 complexes tend to dissociate at the cell surface concomitant – in the case of DUOX2/DUOXA1 – with loss of intramolecular dismutation of O₂⁻ to H₂O₂ (Zamproni et al., 2008; Morand et al., 2009). These findings indicate an integral role of the DUOXA subunit, presumably in concert with the ectodomain of DUOX, in dismutation of O₂⁻ to H₂O₂. Despite sequence similarity of the extracellular DUOX domain to heme peroxidases, residues involved in heme coordination (Colas and Ortiz de Montellano, 2003) are not conserved in DUOX consistent with a lack of detectable peroxidase activity of the recombinant protein *in vitro* (Grasberger et al., 2007a; Morand et al., 2009; Meitzler and Ortiz de Montellano, 2009).

### Identification of patients with defects in thyroidal H₂O₂ generation

Given their proposed role in iodide organification and iodotyrosine coupling, the components of the thyroidal H₂O₂ generator were immediately recognized as attractive candidate genes for CH due to thyroid dyshormonogenesis. When the synthesis defect results in reduced hormone secretion, the ensuing diminished negative feedback on the anterior pituitary thyrotrophs leads to an increase in thyrotropin (TSH) secretion stimulating the thyroid. Consequently, patients with dyshormonogenesis are born with a hyperplastic thyroid gland (goiter) or develop goiter postnatally, especially when diagnosis and treatment with levothyroxine (L-T₄) are delayed.

The etiological classification of primary CH is based on clinical and biochemical evaluation (see Fig. 2 for a suggested diagnostic algorithm). Other than hormone level in serum, useful diagnostics include thyroglobulin concentration in serum and thyroid ultrasound and/or scintigraphy, using ⁹⁹ᵐTc or, preferably, ¹²³I (Clerc et al., 2008). The perchlorate (ClO₄⁻) discharge test is the only sensitive and specific diagnostics to detect a deficiency in iodide organification. The ClO₄⁻ discharge test relies on the fact that iodide transported into the follicular lumen is immediately covalently bound to TG (i.e., organified) and therefore does not normally require the concentrating activity of the basolateral sodium iodide symporter (SLC5A5) for its retention. The test involves the administration of radioiodide, the thyroidal uptake of which is measured by counting over the neck using a gamma camera. Two hours later, further iodide uptake is blocked using ClO₄⁻, a competitive inhibitor of the symporter (Fig. 1). While organified iodine is retained, free iodide remaining in the thyroid gland is washed out leading to a fall of radioisotope counts over the ensuing hour. A positive test result (>10% discharge of activity after ClO₄⁻) indicates inefficient iodide organification at the apical thyroid cell membrane. Thus, defects in the organification enzyme (TPO), iodide efflux across the apical thyrocyte membrane (SLC26A4), or the generation of H₂O₂ can underlie a positive test results. Often infants with confirmed CH are started on thyroid hormone replacement without detailed etiologic diagnosis. The latter is relegated to later years (usually 2–3 years of age) following a one-month withdrawal of L-T₄ replacement.

Genetic defects in DUOX2 and DUOXA2 have been associated with CH. In human thyroid gland, DUOX2 and DUOXA2 mRNA expression is up to fivefold higher compared to DUOX1 and DUOXA1, respectively (Pachucki et al., 2004; Grasberger and Refetoff, 2006). The lack of reported DUOX1 mutations in CH is therefore most likely due to sufficient compensation by DUOX2.

#### 3. DUOX2 mutations in congenital hypothyroidism

Since the first description of DUOX2 mutations in patients with CH in 2002, at least 22 different mutations have been reported (Fig. 3).

Moreno et al. screened DUOX1 and DUOX2 for mutations in patients with CH and positive ClO₄⁻ discharge test (>10% washout) (Moreno et al., 2002). None of the patients harbored a mutation in DUOX1. 12 patients had partial iodide organification defect (PIOD) and CH at screening that proved to be transient during follow-up. Of these, three were found to have heterozygous nonsense or frameshift mutations in DUOX2 (Q686X, R701X, S965fsX29). The predicted truncated proteins lack the NOX2 homolog domain. Thus, in contrast to other known dyshormonogenesis defects (i.e., in TPO, TG, SLC5A5, SLC26A4, or IYD), which are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, a single defective DUOX2 allele can cause haploinsufficiency resulting in transient CH. The manifestation is limited to the neonatal period when thyroid hormone synthesis requirements are highest (from about 10 µg T₄/kg body weight/day gradually decreasing to around 2 µg T₄/kg body weight/day after the first year of life) (LaFranchi, 1999). Consistent with transient manifestation of CH, adult heterozygotes in these families had all normal serum TSH levels.

Screening a cohort of 45 patients with severe congenital hypothyroidism and total iodide organification defect (>90% washout), the same authors found that 44 had biallelic mutations in TPO and only one patient had biallelic mutations in DUOX2. This patient was homozygous for a nonsense mutation (R434X). The patient’s severe hypothyroidism and complete organification defect (100% discharge) has been interpreted to reflect total inability to synthesize thyroid hormone in the absence of DUOX2.

Several subsequent studies have linked biallelic DUOX2 defects to PIOD. Vigone et al. studied two siblings with CH, PIOD and mild, permanent hyperthyrotropinemia after the neonatal period (Vigone et al., 2005). The patients were compound heterozygous for a nonsense mutation (R842X) and a missense mutation (R376W). Since R376W is a null mutant due to complete intracellular retention *in vitro* (Grasberger et al., 2007a), these patients appear to have complete loss of DUOX2 activity. It is reasonable to assume that DUOX1 partially compensates for the defect in DUOX2. Although the heterozygous parents had normal thyroid function tests, ClO₄⁻ discharge testing revealed a slight but permanent impairment in the efficiency of iodide organification in both of them.

Varela et al. (2006) screened 17 unrelated patients with iodide  
organization defect (ClO₄⁻ discharge test >30%) for mutations in  
TPO and DUOX2 using single-strand conformational polymorphism  
analysis. Two patients with permanent CH were found to have  
compound heterozygous DUOX2 mutations. One was compound  
heterozygous for a missense mutation (Q36H) and a deletion of  
four nucleotides (c.2895–2898delGTTCC), which causes a frameshift  
at amino acid 965 with a putative premature stop codon at position  
994 (S965fsX29). The Q36H mutation completely abolishes DUOX2  
function when expressed in a heterologous system reconstituted  

with DUOXA2 (Grasberger et al., 2007a) suggesting complete loss  
of DUOX2 activity in the compound heterozygous patient. Of note,  
the S965fsX29 mutation was found in one out of 200 chromosomes  
from the South American control population. This mutation has  
also been identified in other unrelated patients of Dutch (Moreno  
et al., 2002) and presumably Italian¹ ethnicity. The second index

case was compound heterozygous for a single nucleotide deletion (c.1253delG) producing a frameshift at codon 418 (G418fsX64), and a mutation at position –2 of the splice acceptor site in intron 19 (g.IVS19-2A>C) leading to skipping of exon 20 of a mutated mini-gene expressed in vitro and, consequently, results in a frameshift (R886YfsX2).

Given the reported cases from Europe and Latin America, it seemed that biallelic lesions in DUOX2 produce permanent CH, whereas heterozygous mutation carriers display transient CH limited to the neonatal period. In striking contrast to such genotype-phenotype correlation are, however, the results of a recent study in Japanese patients (Maruo et al., 2008). In one of the investigated families, four siblings were compound heterozygous for early frameshift mutations (L479SfsX2 and K628RfsX10) indicating complete loss of DUOX2. Three of them had low thyroid hormone level at birth, mild thyroid gland enlargement, and markedly elevated serum TG consistent with hormone synthesis defect. However, all of them had normal thyroid function tests when L-T4 treatment was discontinued at 7–9 years of age. In addition, the fourth sibling compound heterozygous for the two DUOX2 mutations had only transient hyperthyrotropinemia at birth, which improved without L-T4 supplementation by two months of age. Other patients reported by Maruo et al. were compound heterozygous for a nonsense and a missense mutation (K530X and E879K) or two missense mutations (H678R and L1067S; A649E and R885Q). Although the functional impact of these missense mutations on DUOX2 function has not been evaluated in vitro, it is noteworthy that all patients with biallelic defects had only transient CH.

With the increasing number of reported cases, genotype-phenotype correlations have become more complex than initially anticipated. Monoallelic (dominant) DUOX2 defects have been found in transient to mild permanent CH, biallelic (recessive) defects in transient to severe permanent CH. The expressivity of DUOX2 defects is likely influenced by genetic background (e.g., DUOX1) and may, at least in part, depend on iodide intake. Since iodination by TPO requires both iodide and H₂O₂, increased nutritional iodide could lead to better utilization

of H₂O₂ provided by DUOX1. Excessive amounts of iodide in the traditional Japanese diet could explain why some Japanese patients with complete loss of DUOX2 activity only displayed transient CH or transient hyperthyrotropinemia (Maruo et al., 2008). The study by Vigone et al. (2005) provides further credence to an important role of iodide intake in expressivity of DUOX2 defects. Of the two siblings compound heterozygous for the same DUOX2 mutations, one had documented perinatal iodide overload and did not manifest congenital hypothyroidism at birth. His postnatal follow-up revealed progressively increasing serum TSH level associated with the decline of urinary iodide excretion. The apparent mitigation of DUOX2 deficiency by large amounts of iodide is opposite to the situation in normal infants in whom such iodine overload induces a physiological organification blockade (Wolff-Chaikoff effect).

4. DUOX2 mutations and familial euthyroid goiter

Ohye et al. reported a Japanese patient who developed a progressively enlarging euthyroid goiter with high radioiodide uptake and positive ClO₄⁻ discharge test (73%) in her twenties (Ohye et al., 2008). She became hypothyroid with negative antithyroid antibodies in the 5th decade of life. Screening of DUOX2 revealed homozygosity for a missense mutation (R1110Q) at a conserved position within the first intracellular loop of the NOX2 homolog domain. Interestingly, three of her siblings and her mother were found to have very large goiters as well with only the latter being hypothyroid. Although they were not available for genetic investigation they were presumed to have inherited the same homozygous mutation due to consanguineous marriages in several generations. Of her children and grandchildren, four were heterozygous carriers of the R1110Q mutation. While none of them had goiter, one was prescribed L-T4 following a positive neonatal screening for CH and two were found to have mild hyperthyrotropinemia. Since all family members with euthyroid goiter and biallelic or presumed biallelic defect were born prior to initiation of the national screening program, it is not excluded that they had transient CH in the neonatal period.
This is the first report of a biallelic $DUOX2$ mutation detected in an adult indicating that such dyshormonogenic defects can present as late onset euthyroid goiter. It should be noted, that R1110Q is the only mutation identified within the NOX2 homolog region of $DUOX2$. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effect of this mutation on $DUOX2$ function *in vitro* and the role of $DUOX2$ as candidate gene in familial cases of euthyroid goiter.

### 5. $DUOXA2$ mutations in congenital hypothyroidism

Zamproni et al. screened 11 patients (10 Caucasians and 1 Chinese) with CH and PIOD for mutations in $DUOXA2$ ([Zamproni et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.246)). All patients had normal hearing, normal or high serum TG, and prior mutation screening of $TPO$ and $DUOX2$ had been negative in all of them. This study led to the identification of the first mutation in $DUOXA2$, in a proband of Chinese origin with mild permanent CH and PIOD (18% discharge). The girl was homozygous for a nonsense mutation (Y246X) that resulted in a complete loss of $DUOXA2$ function *in vitro*. Heterozygous carriers of this mutation had normal thyroid function tests including negative neonatal screening for CH and negative $\mathrm{ClO}_4^-$ discharge tests. Accordingly, the loss of a single $DUOXA2$ allele does not lead to haploinsufficiency, in contrast to monallelic $DUOX2$ mutations that cause transient neonatal CH and mild PIOD, which is also detectable in euthyroid adults ([Vigone et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1097/01.chi.0000155026.88888.8c)). Apart from the intact $DUOXA1/DUOX1$ system, an additional mechanism for maintaining adequate $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$ supply in patients with $DUOXA2$ deficiency is the partial activation of $DUOX2$ by $DUOXA1$, as demonstrated *in vitro* ([Zamproni et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.246)). Based on the findings of this study, $DUOXA2$ defects may not be prevalent among Caucasian patients with CH and PIOD. However, the Y246X $DUOXA2$ mutation appears to be frequent in the Shanghai Chinese population surveyed. This view is supported by nonconsanguinity of the proband’s parents but also by the identification of one additional carrier of the Y246X mutation among 92 unrelated controls. Thus the frequency of CH patients homozygous for Y246X has been estimated at one of 34,000 newborns in this population.

We recently found a more complex genetic alteration of the $DUOX/DUOXA$ system in an infant born to euthyroid non-consanguineous parents.² The child presented with dyshormogenesis in the neonatal period and essentially normal thyroid function after L-T₄ withdrawal at 3 years of age. Genetic analysis revealed a missense mutation (C189R) on the maternal $DUOXA2$ allele causing complete loss-of-function *in vitro*. On the paternal allele, a large deletion comprising $DUOX2$, $DUOXA2$, and $DUOXA1$ was identified. Thus, in this patient, near normal thyroid function is maintained after the neonatal period despite having only a single functional $DUOXA$ allele (maternal $DUOXA1$). This mild phenotype contrasts to the lack of thyroid hormone synthesis in mice completely deficient in $Duoxa$ (personal observation). The high degree of functional redundancy for defects in $DUOXA$ is likely due to molar excess of $DUOXA$ over $DUOX$ protein in the ER owing to reduced synthesis efficiency of the more complex $DUOX$ subunit. Since $DUOXA2$ deficiency results in partial loss of function of the $DUOX2$-based $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$ generator, one can anticipate that expressivity of such defects, as those in $DUOX2$, will be modified by nutritional iodide supply.

### 6. Defects in the positive control system of the thyroidal $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$ generator

In various species, including humans, the TSH receptor ($TSHR$) activates both the $G_s$/adenyl cyclase/cAMP and the $G_q$/phospholipase C-$\beta$ signalling cascades ([Laurent et al., 1987](https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-4827(87)90002-8); [Allgeier et al., 1994](https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-4827(94)90002-8); [Van Sande et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.01.001)) (Fig. 1). The cAMP pathway has been suggested to account for most of the biological effects of TSH on thyroid cells, including growth and proliferation, iodide uptake, and hormone secretion. The $G_q$/phospholipase C-$\beta$ pathway, which leads to mobilization of intracellular calcium by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and to activation of PKC via formation of diacylglycerol, regulates hormone synthesis by stimulating apical efflux and organification of iodide. The later effect is due to synergistic activation of $DUOX2$ by PKC-mediated phosphorylation and cytosolic calcium ([Rigutto et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2009.01.001)). We hypothesized that specific $TSHR$ mutations that disturb the equilibrium between $G_s$- and $G_q$-coupled activated receptor states could preferentially abolish signalling of the $G_q$ pathway and, thus, produce PIOD.

One such $TSHR$ mutation (L653V) was identified in homozygous state in three patients with marked hyperthyrotropinemia and abnormally high 2-h radioiodide uptake as well as 2- to 24-h radioiodide uptake ratios indicating an imbalance between iodide trapping and organification ([Grasberger et al., 2007b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2007.01.001)). In vitro functional studies showed that efficacy of L653V $TSHR$ for inositol phosphates accumulation was only 14% of wild type $TSHR$ despite essentially normal maximum cAMP response. Although serum TSH concentrations appeared to be inappropriately high for the mild defect in cAMP signal transduction, the patients did not develop goiters. These findings are remarkably consistent with the subsequently described phenotype of mice with selective inactivation of $G_q/G_{11}$ in thyrocytes ([Kero et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.001)). Such mice indeed showed a defect in iodide organification without the expected proliferative response to elevated TSH. Overall, these studies provided the first *in vivo* evidence for the physiological significance of the TSH-stimulated $G_q$ pathway in regulating the thyroid $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$-generating system. Given that other $TSHR$ mutations with preferential loss of $G_q$-coupling have been found in systematic *in vitro* mutagenesis studies, $TSHR$ should be considered another candidate gene in unexplained PIOD.

### 7. Implications of genetic screening

The incidence of $DUOX2$ mutations in CH has not been determined. Certainly, $DUOX2$ mutations are frequent in the subgroup of CH patients with confirmed PIOD. For instance, 7 of 20 such unrelated patients from Italy were found to have pathogenic $DUOX2$ mutations.³ Screening of $DUOX2$ is therefore recommended in patients with non-syndromic PIOD. A complete diagnostic work up ([Pfarr et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2006.01.001); Fig. 2) facilitates the selection of patients in whom mutation screening of $DUOX2$ or $DUOXA2$ is most warranted. In practice, a complete etiologic classification will often be impossible since certain tests (e.g., $\mathrm{ClO}_4^-$ discharge testing) are not readily available outside specialized centers. In cases with suspected non-syndromic organification defect (normal sized to enlarged thyroid gland with high serum TG) not confirmed by $\mathrm{ClO}_4^-$ discharge test, $TPO$ would be the first line candidate gene, especially if CH is profound, followed by $DUOX2$ and $DUOXA2$.

If genetic screening reveals missense mutations in $DUOX2$ or $DUOXA2$, their functional relevance can be assessed by coexpression of both factors in heterologous cell systems and determination of basal or calcium-stimulated $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$ release ([Grasberger et al., 2007a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2007.01.001)). Such reconstitution experiments will help to further knowledge on structure function relationships of the $DUOX/DUOXA$ complex.

Other than providing useful information for genetic counselling, there are additional benefits to a definite genetic diagnosis. One

is the potential impact on treatment. Future studies may explore whether patients with DUOX2/DUOXA2 defects may be efficiently managed with iodide supplementation after the neonatal period as alternative to life-long L-T₄. The identification of a DUOX2/DUOXA2 mutation has also implications for the follow-up of a patient with transient CH since it indicates a permanent lesion in the organifi- cation capacity of the patient’s thyroid, in contrast to completely reversible, non-genetic causes of transient CH. Even if euthyroid at a particular point in time, increased demand for thyroid hor- mone synthesis (e.g., during pregnancy (Alexander et al., 2004)) or insufficient nutritional iodide intake may precipitate recurrent hypothyroidism.
