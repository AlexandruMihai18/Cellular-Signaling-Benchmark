### Abstract

Prolonged opioid exposure occurs frequently as a result of clinical use or drug abuse. Research using different ligands, cell lines, and animal models in the past three decades has elucidated some correlation between the biochemical events and behavioral changes resulting from opioid tolerance, dependence and addiction. For the most part, opioid tolerance and dependence are associated with up-regulation of the cAMP pathway, mediated by the supersensitization of adenylyl cyclase and by the altered coupling of opioid receptors to stimulatory G proteins. Neuroadaptive changes in signal transduction following prolonged opioid exposure are mediated by protein kinase systems, such as protein kinase C (PKC), cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Intermediate steps between opioid receptor activation and the second- or third-messenger cascades include GRK-mediated receptor endocytosis and intracellular trafficking, as well as interactions with excitatory amino acid receptors and regulation of nitric oxide synthesis. Thus, prolonged occupancy by opioid receptor agonists can have differential effects on opioid receptor internalization, down-regulation and desensitization, and in the supersensitization of adenylyl cyclase, which contribute to the development of opioid tolerance and dependence. We discuss the role of various protein kinases in the signaling mechanisms underlying these differences. Clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms of opioid tolerance and dependence will help in the treatment of patients suffering from acute and chronic pain, or drug dependence and addiction. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

tolerance and dependence will not be discussed, since these have been reviewed recently [165].

2. Opioid receptor desensitization

Desensitization is defined as the progressive loss of receptor function under continued exposure to an agonist. The effects of an agonist that desensitize its receptor is termed homologous desensitization, whereas desensitization of co-expressed receptors is termed heterologous desensitization. Homologous and heterologous opioid receptor desensitization has been observed in mouse neuroblastoma×glioma cells (NG108-15 cells), human neuroblastoma cells and opioid receptor-transfected cells, as well as native neurons, depending on the opioid receptor type and the intracellular effector investigated. Examples of homologous desensitization include the inhibition of AC by δ-opioid receptors in NG108-15 cells [120], in SK-N-BE cells [87], in the nucleus accumbens and the caudate-putamen [167], inhibition of AC by μ-opioid receptors in transfected CHO cells [259], Neuro<sub>2a</sub> cells [35], and coupling of the μ-receptor with K<sup>+</sup> currents in the rat locus coeruleus (LC) [84, 172], and in Xenopus oocyte cells [261] or Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in SH-SY5Y cells [105, 106]. Examples of heterologous desensitization include the coupling of μ-opioid receptor with Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in rat dorsal root ganglion cells [168] and with K<sup>+</sup> currents in Xenopus oocytes [114], as well as the inhibition of AC by δ-opioid receptors in SK-N-BE cells [156] and by μ- and δ-opioid receptors in the thalamus and in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) [167], and by κ-opioid receptors in the mouse dorsal root ganglia [8].

Opioid receptor desensitization follows the phosphorylation mediated by several different protein kinases (such as cAMP-dependent PKA, CaMKII, protein kinase C (PKC), G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), or MAPKs) [29, 83, 116, 149, 193, 221]. This mechanism is supported by increased phosphoprotein levels in μ-opioid receptor transfected CHO cells [261] or HEK 293 cells [7], and δ-opioid receptor-transfected HEK 293 cells [174] after prolonged opioid exposure. Several studies display interesting parallels between opioid receptor phosphorylation and agonist-induced desensitization [87, 174, 261]. Moreover, the rank order of opioid ligand efficacy in producing functional desensitization in μ-receptor transfected CHO cells generally parallels their rank order in producing receptor phosphorylation [259].

Despite these data, the relationships between receptor
desensitization and opioid tolerance remain controversial. Morphine clearly induces behavioral tolerance in animals and humans, but it fails to desensitize μ-receptors and instead causes AC supersensitization (increases in forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels) after chronic treatment [9–11,86]. There are important differences in the desensitization of opioid receptors between various opioid agonists. Opioid receptor desensitization occurred in NG108-15 cells and μ-receptor transfected CHO cells following chronic treatment with methadone and buprenorphine but not following morphine treatment. Chronic morphine treatment of these cells resulted in marked compensatory increases in cAMP and naloxone-precipitated cAMP rebound, but no significant changes were observed in cells chronically treated with methadone, buprenorphine, etorphine, or dihydroetorphine. Interestingly, incubation of the same cells concomitantly with methadone and morphine, substantially inhibited the morphine-induced compensatory and naloxone-precipitated cAMP rebound, indicating that methadone can inhibit the chronic effects of morphine by desensitization of μ-opioid receptors [126–128].

Mechanisms for the desensitization of opioid receptors include the down-regulation, internalization, and the uncoupling of opioid receptors from underlying G proteins. These mechanisms may be dependent on the intracellular trafficking of opioid receptors regulated by some protein kinases. Experimental data for these putative mechanisms are examined below.

### 2.1. Down-regulation of opioid receptors

Changes in receptor number or affinity provide an attractive mechanism to explain the loss of responsiveness that is characteristic of tolerance. Down-regulation of opioid receptors is characterized by a generalized loss of both cell surface and intracellular receptors. Receptor down-regulation after chronic opioid exposure clearly has been demonstrated in vitro [126–128], whereas the results of in vivo studies are highly variable [260]. Opioid receptors in brain have been reported to decrease [59,219], increase [91,155,187,188], or remain unchanged [92,109] following chronic administration of agonists. The molecular basis of opioid receptor down-regulation is not well understood, although phosphorylation by GRKs or cAMP responsive kinases (or both) could play a significant part in receptor down-regulation [100].

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that receptor down-regulation is agonist selective and depends on the agonist's intrinsic efficacy, although down-regulation does not appear to be an essential factor for the development of tolerance [12,36,39,130,182,256]. Nishino and colleagues first demonstrated a convincing dissociation between tolerance and μ-receptor down-regulation [166], which was confirmed by several subsequent studies [39,58,177,260]. The highly efficacious agonist, etorphine, markedly decreases the density of μ- and δ-receptors in vitro

[107,120,219,256], but causes minimal tolerance and dependence in animals [1,61]. Also, naloxone-precipitated cAMP overshoot does not occur in NG108-15 cells chronically treated with etorphine [127,128,153]. Conversely, chronic morphine generally fails to show down-regulation of opioid receptors in vivo (up-regulation of opioid receptors occurs instead), but causes significant tolerance and dependence in animals and humans [25,177,188,189,256], which is associated with a robust naloxone-precipitated cAMP overshoot in vitro [128,153,245,258].

Loss of the ability of opioid receptor agonists to inhibit AC was correlated with opioid receptor down-regulation [33], although more recent data do not support this hypothesis. In NG108-15 cells, receptor desensitization occurs well before down-regulation during adaptation to chronic opioid exposure [120]. Treatment of NG108-15 cells with methadone results in a marked desensitization but no obvious receptor down-regulation was detected [127]. With chronic opioid exposure of the μ-receptor-containing 7315C pituitary cells, receptor down-regulation required considerably higher doses and longer exposure times than did desensitization [181,182]. These studies have seriously challenged the role of receptor down-regulation as one of the mechanisms causing opioid tolerance.

#### 2.2. Internalization of opioid receptors

Similar to other G protein-coupled receptors, μ- and δ-opioid receptors undergo rapid agonist-mediated internalization via classical endocytosis [78,228]. The rapid process of receptor internalization, which occurs within minutes after μ- or δ-opioid receptor activation, has been observed in animal and human neuroblastoma cells, in μ- or δ-receptor transfected cell lines and in native neurons [7,14,43,56,103,104,121]. Unlike the process of receptor down-regulation, receptor internalization is not associated with the delivery of receptor/ligand complex to lysosomes [121], therefore it occurs without a decrease in receptor density as measured in cell lysates [102]. Rapid internalization of these receptors may play a role in their functional recovery by promoting receptor/ligand dissociation [175,257]. Further, the endocytosis of desensitized receptors is required for dephosphorylation and subsequent resensitization to their pre-ligand-bound state [69].

Regulation of opioid receptors by rapid endocytosis may be of particular importance for understanding some of the mechanisms of opioid tolerance. In vitro studies show significant differences in internalization of μ-opioid receptors between etorphine, dihydroetorphine and morphine. Like native peptide ligands, etorphine and dihydroetorphine markedly stimulate the internalization of μ-opioid receptors whereas morphine activates opioid receptors without causing their internalization [7,32,103,104,246,263]. Receptor internalization is not detected even in the presence of saturating concentrationsof morphine, which cause maximal receptor-mediated inhibition of AC activity [103]. Similar results were obtained from in vivo neurons in the rat brain and the myenteric plexus [104,215]. Mice chronically treated with etorphine or dihydroetorphine develop less tolerance than those treated with equally effective doses of morphine [1,61]. When dihydroetorphine is used as an analgesic agent it causes less tolerance and dependence than morphine in both clinical [183] and animal studies [93,223,225].

Differences between morphine and etorphine/dihydroetorphine suggest that the absence of opioid receptor internalization by morphine may be related to an increased potential for producing opioid tolerance. Thus, the activation of opioid receptors without internalization causes important disturbances in neuronal homeostasis, which contribute to the pathophysiology of opioid tolerance and dependence [246]. The agonist specificity of opioid receptor endocytosis determines the neuronal signals underlying some of the cognitive and behavioral components of opioid tolerance/dependence [104].

β-Arrestin and GRKs appear to play fundamental roles in agonist-mediated opioid receptor internalization. Differential regulation μ-opioid receptor internalization and desensitization by different opioid agonists seems related to their promotion of GRK-dependent receptor phosphorylation [32]. Agonist-dependent β-arrestin binding to μ-opioid receptors serves a dual role in mediating this process. First, β-arrestin binding rapidly desensitizes cells to the agonist by uncoupling adjacent opioid receptors from G proteins. Second, by associating the receptor with clathrin-coated pits, β-arrestin targets agonist-bound receptors to recycling endosomes from where they are sent back to the cell surface, to be re-available for agonist-binding [21,31]. Studies on the δ-opioid receptor suggest that agonist-induced dimerization may be a prerequisite for receptor internalization and that the C-terminal tail is necessary for dimerization and internalization. The deletion or mutation of a portion of the C-terminal results in a loss of both dimerization and receptor internalization [56,215]. These data suggest that the membrane trafficking of opioid receptors may cause their desensitization or resensitization, but the precise mechanisms by which this leads to opioid tolerance remain unclear.

signal-transduction mechanisms contributing to opioid tolerance and dependence [26,62,127].

Opioid agonist-stimulated \[^{35}S\]GTPγS binding to membranes has been observed in neuroblastoma cell lines, in other cells transfected with opioid receptors, and in native neurons [63,199,209,210,218]. There are important differences in the extent to which different opioid agonists stimulate \[^{35}S\]GTPγS binding to membranes [63,199], reflecting differences in their ability to activate its G protein [63,127]. Chronic treatment with opioids results in significant reduction of agonist-stimulated \[^{35}S\]GTPγS binding to neuronal membranes [26,62,209,255]. In rat μ-opioid receptor transfected C₆ glial cells, following chronic treatment with 10-μM concentrations of etorphine, DAMGO, β-endorphin, morphine and butorphanol, the DAMGO-stimulated \[^{35}S\]GTPγS binding was 58, 149, 205, 286 and 325%, respectively, as compared to untreated cell membranes [255]. Chronic treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with DAMGO for 48 h showed a greater effect on the uncoupling of receptors from G proteins than did treatment with morphine [62]. Chronic treatment of NG108-15 cells with methadone led to a marked decrease in DADLE-stimulated \[^{35}S\]GTPγS binding to membranes, but under the same experimental conditions a similar effect was not observed in morphine-treated cells [127].

Some studies suggest that morphine treatment fails to cause uncoupling of opioid receptors from G proteins. Treatment of μ-opioid receptor transfected HEK 293 cells with morphine for 30 min did not result in any loss of the ability of DAMGO to stimulate \[^{35}S\]GTPγS binding to membranes, although similar exposure to DAMGO resulted in a complete loss of the ability of morphine to stimulate \[^{35}S\]GTPγS binding to membranes [246]. A similar effect was observed in SK-N-SH cells that predominantly express μ-receptors [26]. Chronic treatment of NG108-15 cells with DSLET resulted in an 80% loss of DSLET-stimulated \[^{35}S\]GTPγS binding [26], whereas treatment of NG108-15 cells with morphine for 48 h failed to cause an obvious loss of DADLE-stimulated \[^{35}S\]GTPγS binding [127]. In vivo, major differences occur with regard to uncoupling of opioid receptors among brain areas following chronic morphine exposure: no uncoupling of μ-opioid receptors occurs in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, thalamus, or substantia nigra, whereas uncoupling occurs in other brain areas (dorsal raphe, LC, lateral and medial parabrachial nuclei, and commissural nucleus of the tractus solitarius) [200,209].

The mechanisms underlying the acute versus chronic opioid treatment-induced uncoupling from G proteins may be different. Chronic opioid treatment-induced G protein uncoupling is blocked by a non-selective protein kinase inhibitor H₇ [62,127], but not by a selective PKC inhibitor, chelerythrine [127], whereas acute opioid treatment-induced uncoupling of opioid receptors from G proteins can be blocked by chelerythrine, but not by H₇ or H₈₉ (a specific PKA inhibitor) [65,127]. These data indicate that

2.3. Uncoupling of opioid receptors from G protein

Down-regulation or internalization of opioid receptors could not entirely explain the phenomena of opioid tolerance, therefore a possible role for altered coupling of opioid receptor and G protein was investigated. Agonist stimulated binding of the hydrolysis-resistant \[^{35}S\]GTPγS to G protein in a concentration-dependent, antagonist-reversible, and pertussis toxin-sensitive manner, provides a useful method to examine the coupling of opioid receptors to G proteins [199,208–210,229], and for investigating thePKA-mediated phosphorylation causes uncoupling of opioid receptors from G proteins following chronic opioid therapy, whereas PKC-mediated phosphorylation occurs following acute opioid exposure. Their regulatory mechanisms are discussed below with the effects of protein kinases on opioid tolerance (Section 4). Although highly correlated, the clinical manifestations of opioid tolerance or dependence cannot be explained simply by changes in receptor number, structure, or function. Robust changes in signal transduction mechanisms also occur, such as up-regulation of the cAMP pathway, which has been classically associated with clinical and experimental phenomena observed in studies of opioid tolerance, dependence and withdrawal.

### 3. Up-regulation of the cAMP pathway

Perhaps the best-established molecular adaptation to chronic opioid exposure is an up-regulation of the cAMP pathway [165]. Up-regulation of the cAMP pathway has been extensively observed in neuroblastoma cell lines, opioid receptor transfected cell lines and native neurons [162, 201, 202, 245, 258]. This up-regulation involves increased concentrations of AC, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and other components of this signaling pathway [165]. The effects of opioids on AC were proposed as a model for investigating opioid tolerance and dependence in vitro [42, 201]. In vivo studies indicate that modulation of neuronal firing rates in the LC contribute to the pharmacological and behavioral effects of opioid dependence and withdrawal [162]. Up-regulation of the cAMP pathway in the LC appears to increase the intrinsic firing rate of neurons through the activation of a non-selective cation channel [2, 3, 165], and this increased firing is related to sympathomimetic activation and specific opioid withdrawal behaviors [136, 138, 164]. Opioids acutely decrease the firing rate of LC neurons via inhibition of AC and activation of an inwardly rectifying K⁺ channel [13, 60]. Upon continued opioid exposure, the firing rate of LC neurons recovers toward pretreatment levels because of compensatory increases in AC activity and cAMP production [60, 119, 143]. This return of neuronal firing rates from inhibited levels to pre-treatment levels represents the development of opioid tolerance, and abrupt cessation of opioid treatment or administration of antagonists leads to an elevation of LC firing rates several-fold above pretreatment levels by leaving the up-regulated cAMP pathway unopposed. The acute inhibition, chronic increase, and rebound of AC activity by opioid withdrawal are also observed in NG108-15 cells, SH-SY5Y cells, and opioid receptor transfected cell lines [201, 245, 258].

Chronic opioid treatment-induced up-regulation of the cAMP pathway also occurs in other important brain regions such as the nucleus accumbens [163, 194, 220, 248], ventral tegmental area [22, 23, 227], the dorsal raphe nucleus [99], and the periaqueductal gray matter [136, 180]. These brain regions are implicated in opioid withdrawal states or in the reinforcing action of most drugs of abuse [162, 165], suggesting that up-regulation of the cAMP pathway could be one mechanism for the motivational effects of opioids [164]. Although up-regulation of cAMP pathway upon chronic opioid exposure has been well established in neuroblastoma cell lines and native neurons, the mechanisms by which chronic opioid exposure elicits up-regulation of cAMP pathway are not well understood.

#### 3.1. Supersensitization of adenylyl cyclase

Earlier studies postulated opioid receptor desensitization as the primary mechanism for the impaired inhibition of AC activity seen in opioid tolerance; alternative mechanisms proposed recently include the supersensitization of AC as well as the direct stimulatory effects of opioid receptors [9–11, 37, 50, 85]. In NG108-15 cells and μ-opioid receptor-transfected CHO cells, chronic morphine treatment leads to a marked accumulation of cAMP, whereas the ability of morphine to inhibit cAMP production is the same before and after treatment [9, 128, 201]. In μ- or δ-opioid receptor-transfected HEK 293 cells and κ-opioid receptor-transfected CHO cells, chronic morphine treatment accentuates the ability of morphine to inhibit AC, despite a significant up-regulation of the cAMP pathway in these cells [18, 19, 24, 97]. These studies suggest that up-regulation of cAMP pathway results from AC supersensitization, rather than from impaired inhibition of AC by desensitization of the opioid receptors. Indeed, supersensitization of AC following chronic opioid exposure has been reported in vitro (from neuronal cell lines, native neurons and other opioid-receptor-transfected cell lines [9, 57, 220, 239, 245]) and from in vivo preparations (e.g. from the guinea pig longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus [37, 38]). Chronic opioid exposure of COS-7 cells co-transfected with μ-opioid receptors and AC induces the supersensitization of AC₁, AC₂, AC₅ and AC₈ isoforms [10, 11]. The supersensitization of AC₂ is particularly significant after chronic exposure to opioids [170, 233].

Some isoforms of AC (AC₁, AC₂, AC₅ and AC₈) predominantly occur in the brain [31, 77, 79, 152, 253]. Neuronal mRNA for AC₅ and AC₈ are highly expressed in the LC and nucleus accumbens and demonstrate robust AC supersensitization in response to chronic morphine treatment [143], which correlates with their important roles in mediating the physiological and behavioral manifestations of opioid withdrawal [111, 197]. Isoform-specific up-regulation of AC₈ (but not AC₁, AC₂ or AC₅) occurs in the dorsal raphe nucleus area following chronic opioid exposure [99]. AC supersensitization following chronic opioid exposure necessitates higher concentrations of agonist to reach the pretreatment levels of cAMP, which may be the primary mechanism underlying opioid dependence. These studies suggest that the neurophysiological consequencesof opioid receptor-mediated supersensitization of AC, rather than disinhibition of AC by desensitization of the opioid receptor, may be the critical mechanisms underlying opioid tolerance and dependence.

Recent studies suggest increases in cellular cAMP levels by a direct stimulation of AC activity and second messenger systems following chronic opioid treatment. The stimulation of Gᵢ protein via opioid receptor activation releases Gβγ subunits and Gₛ-proteins that can stimulate AC activity; this stimulatory effect is further accentuated by phosphorylation of AC isoforms, thus leading to AC supersensitization [38]. In COS-7 cells co-transfected with the μ-opioid receptors and AC₅, the supersensitization of AC₅ following chronic opioid exposure was prevented by pertussis toxin or by co-transfection with the scavengers of Gβγ dimers (e.g. β-adrenergic receptor kinase or α-transducin), thus indicating a role for G protein βγ dimers in AC supersensitization [9]. Other studies also support the supersensitization of AC₁₁ by enhanced expression of the Gβγ subunits of G protein [101, 170, 233]. Chronic morphine treatment up-regulates specific AC isoforms in the myenteric plexus neurons that are also stimulated by Gβγ [37, 38, 187]. Persistent activation of opioid receptors leads to an increased PKC-mediated phosphorylation of AC₁₁, which significantly increases the responsiveness of AC₁₁ isomers to Gβγ and Gₛ [37, 38, 234, 265]. This effect contributes to the observed shift from predominantly inhibitory to stimulatory opioid receptor regulation of AC following prolonged opioid exposure [241, 242, 244].

### 3.2. Opioid receptor coupling with stimulatory G proteins

Supersensitization of AC is perhaps not the only mechanism by which continued opioid receptor activity causes an up-regulation of the cAMP pathway. Further studies suggest that the increase in cAMP accumulation could be due to the ability of opioid receptor to stimulate AC directly via Gₛ proteins [48, 71]. Opioid receptors seem to couple to both Gᵢ and Gₛ protein, and bimodal inhibitory and stimulatory effects mediated by Gᵢ and Gₛ proteins have been demonstrated for most opioids except etorphine and dihydroetorphine [45, 46, 48, 54, 203]. Chronic opioid treatment alters the balance between opioid receptors coupled to inhibitory or stimulatory G proteins, with stimulatory effects becoming more pronounced within a few days of opioid exposure [47, 50]. It is not known whether such alternative coupling occurs via different isoforms of opioid receptor or whether one receptor can alternatively or simultaneously be coupled to different G proteins [48]. Studies with cloned μ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptors transfected into various cell types have shown that they couple to the PTX-sensitive, inhibitory transducer systems via Gᵢ-Gₒ proteins, whereas no biochemical evidence of coupling to excitatory systems via Gₛ proteins was observed [50, 237].

Recent studies demonstrated that a homogeneous population of cloned δ-opioid receptors transfected into CHO cells (which normally show only opioid inhibition of forskolin-stimulated AC via PTX-sensitive Gᵢ coupling) can be rapidly converted to an excitatory model by treatment with GM₁ ganglioside [51, 250, 251]. Application of the same opioid agonist to GM₁-treated cells results in stimulation of AC activity and an increase in cAMP accumulation, suggesting that these cloned opioid receptors have undergone a conformational change, which switched their coupling from Gᵢ to Gₛ proteins, thereby converting these receptors from an inhibitory to a stimulatory mode important differences between Gₛ protein- and Gᵢ protein-coupled receptors include their susceptibility to widely different concentrations of opioid antagonists and their relative effects on AC activity. Gₛ protein-coupled receptors produce greater increases in cAMP levels and are inhibited by picomolar concentrations of naloxone or naltrexone, whereas the Gᵢ protein-coupled receptors produce relatively smaller decreases in cAMP levels but require nanomolar or micromolar concentrations of naloxone for inhibition [50–53, 190]. Furthermore, opioid receptors can indirectly stimulate AC activity by mediating an enhanced coupling of the prostaglandin E₁ receptor to Gₛ protein, as noted in NG108-15 cells and SH-SY5Y cells [4–6].

An up-regulation of excitatory opioid effects during chronic agonist treatment may play important roles in modulating opioid analgesia, tolerance and dependence [50, 190]. The blockade of excitatory opioid effects can diminish the development of tolerance [204, 206]. Etorphine and dihydroetorphine were reported to act as antagonists of the Gₛ-mediated excitatory signal transduction via opioid receptors [129, 204, 206], because they markedly increase the inhibitory potency of morphine and other agonists and they also seem to attenuate the development of opioid tolerance [49].

## 4. Effects of protein kinase-dependent systems

As noted above, the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation states of opioid receptors and other signal transduction proteins are crucial determinants of the mechanisms underlying the desensitization of opioid receptors and up-regulation of the cAMP pathway. This section explores the specific mechanistic effects of second-messenger dependent protein kinases (PKC, PKA, CaMKII), G protein-coupled receptor kinases, and mitogen-activated protein kinases on the adaptive changes resulting from chronic opioid exposure.

### 4.1. Second messenger-dependent protein kinases

#### 4.1.1. Protein kinase C

The phosphorylation of opioid receptors, Gᵢ protein, and
AC by PKC are involved in the desensitization, internalization and down-regulation of opioid receptors, as well as in the supersensitization of AC activity [37, 132, 149, 160, 235]. Like other G protein-coupled receptors, opioid receptors contain PKC phosphorylation sites on the third intracellular loop and the C-terminus, which are important for the desensitization, internalization and down-regulation of opioid receptors [32, 55, 173, 215]. Indeed, the C-terminus of μ- and δ-opioid receptors is required for agonist-mediated phosphorylation [78, 264]. Chronic morphine exposure causes PKC-mediated phosphorylation of AC and a shift from the predominantly inhibitory to the stimulatory opioid receptor-AC signaling observed in opioid tolerance and dependence [37]. PKC-mediated phosphorylation of AC isoforms (type II and VII) significantly increases their stimulatory responsiveness to G<sub>α</sub> and G<sub>βγ</sub> subunits [37, 38, 234, 265]. This mechanism could mediate, at least partially, the stimulatory effects of opioid withdrawal.

Chronic morphine exposure stimulates cytosolic PKC activity [157] as well as membrane-bound PKC activity in the rat brain [158], in DRG neurons, and in laminae I and II neurons from the spinal cord [139, 145]. Up-regulation of PKC<sub>α</sub> and PKC<sub>β</sub> has also been observed in myenteric plexus neurons obtained from chronic morphine treated animals [243]. This increase in PKC activity parallels the development of tolerance to opioid analgesia in vivo [73, 139, 145, 157–159]. These data collectively suggest that chronic opioid-induced activation of PKC may play a role in the development of tolerance.

The phosphoinositol (PI) pathway plays a key role in mediating PKC activity [75, 76, 146], although the roles of μ-opioid receptors versus δ-opioid receptors in initiating PI/PKC cascade remain controversial. Some investigators suggest that μ-opioid receptor agonists stimulate PI hydrolysis to initiate the cascade [146], whereas others argue that PI hydrolysis results from the activation of δ-opioid receptor and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) rather than μ-opioid receptors [75, 76]. Recent studies in vitro have demonstrated that activation of μ-opioid receptors [98, 211, 212], δ-opioid receptors [151, 169, 213, 236] and κ-opioid receptors [236, 240], all activate phospholipase C (PLC), resulting in the formation of inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), and diacylglycerol (DAG), which is followed by PKC activation. Activation of both recombinant and endogenous opioid receptors stimulates PI turnover, leading to the production of IP<sub>3</sub> in a variety of cell lines and in rat spinal trigeminal neurons [40, 41, 90, 96, 212–214]. Opioid-induced activation of PLC is mediated by PTX-sensitive G proteins in cells expressing endogenous receptors as well as those transfected with cloned opioid receptors [96, 151, 169, 211, 233]. The role of βγ subunits released from PTX-sensitive G proteins has been postulated as a mechanism for PLC activation [169, 233]. Further studies may establish whether the in vivo activation of μ-opioid receptor has the same effects as

in vitro activation, and further in vivo studies may elucidate the regulation of PI/PKC signaling in neurons by the cross-talk between the NMDA and opioid receptor systems.

### 4.1.2. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II

A significant role for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was recently demonstrated in opioid receptor desensitization and sensitization [64, 136, 149]. Agonist-induced desensitization results from CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of μ-opioid receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells or Xenopus oocytes [110, 149]; this effect is markedly attenuated by site-directed mutagenesis of the CaMKII phosphorylation sites on the third intracellular loop of μ-opioid receptors [110]. Recent evidence demonstrates that both acute and chronic morphine treatment modulate the expression and activity of CaMKII in the rat hippocampus [133]. Inhibitors of hippocampal CaMKII activity (KN62 or KN93) strongly attenuate the development of tolerance and physical dependence in response to chronic morphine treatment. Down-regulation of hippocampal CaMKII expression by its antisense oligonucleotide also remarkably attenuates the development of morphine tolerance and dependence [66]. CaMKII phosphorylates the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) [144, 216] and mediates the activation of MAPK [154]. The roles of CREB and MAPK in the mechanisms of opioid tolerance and dependence are well-described [95, 119, 137, 176, 195]. Thus, multiple lines of evidence support the role of CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation in the development of opioid tolerance and dependence. The mechanisms by which opioid receptors modulate CaMKII activity remain unclear. The activation of μ-opioid receptors by morphine causes PI hydrolysis, inositol formation, and subsequent release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores [266]. Another mechanism may involve NMDA receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-currents in the forebrain with downstream activation of CaMKII [124], although there is no direct evidence to support these mechanisms in opioid-tolerant cells. Up-regulation of the cAMP pathway after chronic opioid treatment is another possible mechanism for CaMKII phosphorylation and modulation of its activity [20, 165]. Despite their plausibility, these mechanisms remain speculative and further studies are required to establish the mechanisms for regulation of CaMKII activity by opioid exposure.

### 4.1.3. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase

PKA-mediated phosphorylation of receptors, ion channels, and intracellular messenger proteins has been implicated in the neuroadaptation induced by chronic opioid exposure. An up-regulation of cAMP level during chronic opioid treatment will lead to PKA activation, and this phenomenon occurs in neuroblastoma cell lines and in brain tissues [16, 132, 161, 207]. Activation of PKA during chronic opioid treatment phosphorylates μ-opioid receptors
[17, 37] and disrupts coupling of the μ-opioid receptor to G<sub>i</sub> proteins [82, 83]. PKA also phosphorylates ligand-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels, the NMDA receptors [76, 123], which are involved in the development of opioid tolerance and dependence [232].

The mesolimbic dopamine system is believed to play a role in motivational states and is implicated in the reinforcing actions of most drugs of abuse [112]. The up-regulated cAMP pathway may modulate these effects through PKA-mediated phosphorylation of D<sub>1</sub> dopamine receptors, voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels [198, 247], as well as the phosphorylation and activation of CREB protein, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of numerous genes [113]. CREB is involved in long-term potentiation (LTP) and other cellular models of learning and memory, proposed as the neuroplasticity underlying drug addiction [165]. PKA can also stimulate the synthesis of GM<sub>1</sub> ganglioside via phosphorylation of specific glycosyltransferases [147, 148, 192], which plays an important role in the regulation of excitatory opioid effects [252]. Chronic exposure to opioid significantly elevates GM<sub>1</sub> ganglioside activity in δ-opioid receptor transfected CHO cells [252] and DRG neurons [52]. Increased GM<sub>1</sub> activity results in a rapid conversion of many opioid receptors from a G<sub>i</sub>/G<sub>o</sub>-coupled inhibitory mode to a G<sub>s</sub>-coupled excitatory mode. Increased excitatory opioid receptor functions during chronic morphine treatment appears to be a major factor underlying the attenuation of opioid inhibitory potency (tolerance) and the development of opioid excitatory supersensitivity (dependence) [53].

Furthermore, chronic exposure to morphine (or cocaine) in vivo up-regulates cAMP formation and PKA activity in specific brain regions known to mediate drug addiction [197, 220, 222, 238], correlated with changes in the electrophysiological properties of neurons in these regions and with the specific behavioral features of addiction [165, 198, 247]. Intracerebro-ventricular or locus coeruleus (LC) administration of H<sub>7</sub> or H<sub>8</sub> (non-selective and selective inhibitors of PKA, respectively), attenuates the behavioral signs of opiate withdrawal [136, 224]. Similarly, intra-LC and periqueductal gray (PAG) infusions of Rr-cAMPS, a specific PKA inhibitor, significantly attenuates opioid withdrawal behaviors, whereas the intra-LC or intra-PAG infusion of PKA activator Sr-cAMPS accentuates opioid withdrawal behaviors and can even elicit withdrawal-like behaviors in opioid-naive animals [180]. These findings indicate that drug-induced up-regulation of PKA activity in these brain regions may contribute to the development of opioid dependence and drug addiction.

### 4.2. G protein-coupled receptor kinases

Although phosphorylation by second messenger-dependent protein kinases (PKA, PKC, CaMKII) may significantly regulate opioid receptor activity, more recent studies suggest that intracellular trafficking of the opioid receptors mediated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) plays an important role in the regulation of μ- and δ-opioid receptor function [27, 70, 87, 117]. Studies on the regulation of the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>-AR) have identified GRKs and β-arrestin as the crucial molecular determinants of receptor desensitization and re-sensitization [67, 262]. This molecular scheme has now been extended to other G protein-coupled receptors and probably represents a common regulatory mechanism for several members of this superfamily [68, 70, 94, 191]. Strong correlations between GRK-mediated μ-opioid receptor phosphorylation, β-arrestin binding, and μ-opioid receptor desensitization [32, 116, 259], suggest that GRKs may play a pivotal role in the regulation of μ-opioid receptor function.

In the rat locus coeruleus, a region rich in μ-opioid receptors, the levels of GRK<sub>2</sub> and β-arrestin expression are increased by chronic morphine administration [8, 221]. Co-expression of GRK<sub>3</sub> and β-arrestin<sub>2</sub> in Xenopus oocytes attenuates the μ-opioid receptor-activated potassium conductance [94, 115], and GRK<sub>2</sub> overexpression attenuates μ-opioid receptor-mediated inhibition of AC activity [32, 246]. When β-adrenergic receptor kinase-1 (β ARK-1) or GRK<sub>5</sub> are over-expressed in δ-receptor transfected HEK 293 cells, agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation and desensitization are enhanced [29, 174]. Conversely, when a dominant negative mutant form of β ARK-1 is over-expressed in these cells, a significant decrease occurs in opioid receptor phosphorylation and desensitization [29, 174]. Similarly, COS-7 cells co-transfected with κ-opioid receptors and the mutant β ARK-1 abolish κ receptor desensitization [185]. Thus, opioid tolerance caused by chronic morphine exposure increases GRK<sub>2</sub> expression in the LC, whereas GRK<sub>2</sub> over-expression leads to impaired opioid receptor function, which is a characteristic hallmark of receptor desensitization and opioid tolerance.

The ability of distinct opioid agonists to differentially regulate μ-opioid receptor internalization and desensitization is related to their ability to promote GRK<sub>2</sub>-dependent phosphorylation of the μ-opioid receptor [32, 246]. Although both etorphine and morphine effectively activate μ-opioid receptors, they differ in their ability to induce tolerance and in their effects on receptor internalization. Etorphine elicits robust μ-opioid receptor internalization but morphine fails to induce an internalization of μ-opioid receptors. However, if GRK<sub>2</sub> is over-expressed, morphine gains the capacity to induce μ-opioid receptor phosphorylation, accompanied by β-arrestin binding and receptor sequestration [32, 246, 263]. The ability of GRK<sub>2</sub> over-expression to facilitate morphine-induced μ-opioid receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding is particularly intriguing as a mechanism for the development of opioid tolerance and dependence [32, 150, 165, 186]. The differential regulation of μ-opioid receptor sequestration by specific agonists may provide a molecular basis for the different analgesic properties of opioid drugs and their distinct abilities to induce opioid tolerance.
4.3. Mitogen-activated protein kinases

The long-term effects of opioids may be mediated by the MAPK signal pathway [125, 164], given the functional coupling of opioid receptors to MAPKs, as demonstrated recently [28, 72, 125, 196]. MAPKs, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that play pivotal roles in signal transduction downstream from the mitogenic receptor tyrosine kinases, ras and raf proteins. MAPKs regulate cytoskeleton proteins, phospholipase A2, and transcription factors such as C-Jun, Fos B, C-Myc, Elk-1 and ATF-2 [196]. Stimulation of μ-receptors by opioid agonists results in the significant activation and nuclear translocation of MAPK in CHO cells or HEK 293 cells stably transfected with μ-receptors [72, 125, 193]. Opioid administration also strongly activates the ERK cascade in C6 glioma cells stably expressing μ- and δ-receptors, and similar activation is also seen in transiently transfected COS-7 cells [81]. MAPKs also appear to be involved in the desensitization and internalization of μ- and δ-opioid receptors [76, 95, 193]. An inhibitor of MAPK1 (PD98059) not only prevented MAPK activation but also inhibited homologous desensitization of the μ-opioid receptor by preventing the agonist-stimulated μ-receptor phosphorylation [193]. MAPK activation, in turn, is dependent on the opioid-mediated activation of Gi or Go proteins [150, 186] via the release of Gβγ subunits, which directly stimulate MAPK activity [125]. In vivo studies demonstrate that chronic morphine treatment leads to a sustained increase in ERK activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which, in turn, contributes to drug-induced increases in tyrosine hydroxylase, and other neuroadaptive changes. Morphine withdrawal produces a dramatic activation of MAPK in LC neurons, nucleus of the solitary tract, and the hypothalamus [195]. Thus, MAPK-mediated changes in neural function may explain several behavioral phenomena associated with opioid dependence and withdrawal [15, 164, 171]. Opioid receptor-mediated increases in MAPK activity are also involved in PKC and tyrosine protein kinase regulation [28, 72, 125, 150]. Recently, GRKs were also reported to activate ERKs via focal adhesion complexes, as well as by the GRK-mediated desensitization and sequestration of opioid receptors [135]. The relative importance of these complex interactions has not been established, although the role of MAPKs in the development of opioid tolerance and withdrawal is clearly evident.

[140, 141, 145, 226, 230] (Figs. 1 and 2). Considerable evidence implicates EAA receptors, particularly the NMDA receptor, in the development of opioid tolerance and dependence [226, 230]. Antagonists of EAA receptors and inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase can attenuate opioid tolerance and dependence [74, 88, 231]. Incubation of NG108-15 cells with NMDA significantly attenuated the ability of the δ-opioid receptor agonist DPDPE to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production [30] and to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding to G protein [65]. Similar effects also occur with μ- and κ-opioid receptors in primary cultured neurons and may involve the PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Gα2 protein [65]. In vivo the co-administration of morphine with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 could prevent the development of morphine tolerance and increases in PKCγ immunoreactivity, indicating the involvement of NMDA receptors in morphine tolerance and in PKC up-regulation [139]. Conversely, NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents evoked in the hippocampal dentate gyrus were inhibited by μ-opioid agonists via modulation of PKC activity [40, 142, 254], thus illustrating rich interactions between the signal transduction mechanisms of these receptor systems. Although these interactions are not yet clearly understood, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that PKC activation and increases in intracellular Ca²⁺ are critical events in the opioid and NMDA receptor interactions contributing to the development of opioid tolerance and dependence.

Chronic opioid treatment leads to PKC activation and translocation [40], which phosphorylates the NMDA receptor-gated Ca²⁺ channel, resulting in removal of the Mg²⁺ blockade and potentiation of NMDA-receptor activity [41, 108, 184]. Opening of these channels leads to Ca²⁺ influx and increases intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations, producing several effects:

1. Positive feedback regulation of PKC activity [140, 145];
2. Facilitates activation of CaMKII [136, 149];
3. Promotes further influx of Ca²⁺ through voltage-gated calcium channels [118, 213], which may further accentuate PKC activation;
4. Activates nitric oxide synthase, which increases the production of NO and superoxide [178].

These changes alter the activities of other protein kinase systems as well. PKC may phosphorylate opioid receptors and G proteins directly or indirectly via the activation of GRKs [44, 134, 179, 249]. Ca²⁺ influx may also result in activation of AC and increases in cAMP levels [89, 213], thus enhancing PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor-gated Ca²⁺ channels [34, 123]. In addition, NMDA receptor activation regulates ERK activity because NMDA receptor antagonists blocked the chronic morphine-induced increases in ERK activity [15]. Production of NO leads to greater glutamate release in

Glutamate induced excitability contributes to the expression of behaviors associated with opioid dependence and withdrawal. On the other hand, NO can promote neuronal dysfunction by the activation of nuclear repair enzymes [146].

Although it is generally accepted that PKC activation and translocation is a pivotal event in the interactions between opioid and EAA receptors, consensus has not been reached about the underlying mechanism of PKC activation. As noted above (Section 4.1.1), it is controversial whether PKC activation is initiated by agonists binding to μ-opioid receptors [146], or whether the opioid doses causing tolerance and dependence would inhibit rather than activate PKC. Alternatively, metabotropic glutamate receptors or δ-opioid receptors might play a key role in the regulation of PKC activation because these receptors are positively coupled to PI hydrolysis, which increases during chronic morphine treatment [75,76]. Despite this controversy, it is evident that interactions of opioid and EAA receptors modulate the expression and

activation of PKC, PKA, CaMKII, GRKs, and MAPKs in a ligand-specific and receptor-specific manner, also depending on whether the affected neurons are opioid-naive or opioid-tolerant. Further research, perhaps investigating multiple systems simultaneously, may help to establish the precise regulation of protein kinases by opioid or EAA receptor activity, thus explaining key elements of the mechanisms underlying opioid tolerance and dependence.

### 6. Summary

The effects of chronic opioid exposure have been investigated extensively, using different ligands, cell lines, and animal models. However, a clear picture of the correlation between biochemical effects and behavioral tolerance has yet to emerge, perhaps because of the limited ability to measure changes in several interactive systems. Despite this difficulty, it is well established that opioid tolerance and dependence are associated with up-regulation of the cAMP pathway, most likely mediated by the

supersensitization of AC following chronic opioid exposure, as well as by the altered coupling of opioid receptors to stimulatory G proteins causing up-regulation of cAMP pathway. The stimulatory effects of opioids on second messenger systems and the alterations in signal transduction induced by the cross-talk between these messengers may play a key role in AC supersensitization following chronic opioid exposure. These studies certainly contribute to our understanding of opioid analgesia and tolerance, but are inadequate for explaining all the clinical phenomena associated with opioid tolerance, dependence, and addiction.

The long-term effects of different opioid agonists on intracellular signal transduction are important for understanding the mechanisms of opioid tolerance and dependence. Changes in signal transduction mediated by the rich interactions between the various second messenger protein kinases, such as PKA, PKC, CaMKII, GRKs, and MAPK, are not only important mediators of opioid analgesia, but also regulate diverse cellular functions that mediate the neuroadaptive changes associated with tolerance. Opioid agonist-mediated alterations in signal transduction are complex phenomena and our understanding of the specific

mechanisms underlying these alterations remains rudimentary. Studies aimed at unraveling these intricate signaling events may contribute to a better understanding of opioid tolerance and dependence.

Receptor endocytosis has developed an important role in the mechanisms determining the neuronal signaling. The agonist specificity of opioid receptor endocytosis is particularly important because it supports the hypothesis that different ligands may activate the opioid receptor differently, leading to conformational changes in the receptors that result in divergent intracellular events. Further investigation of this hypothesis may lead to novel strategies for altering the interactions between opioid receptor activation and second- and third-messenger cascades. Clinical observation of the differential effects of morphine, etorphine and other opioids (Table 1) on the development of tolerance provides additional support for this hypothesis. It is likely that fundamental insights into the mechanisms of opioid tolerance and dependence will be uncovered by basic studies of GRK-mediated receptor trafficking and targeting under a variety of physiological and pharmacological conditions.

agonists on receptor internalization, down-regulation, and desensitization, or in the supersensitization of AC, are also important. The signaling mechanisms underlying these differences most likely involve various protein kinases and may contribute to their different liability for producing tolerance and dependence. Therapeutic advances resulting from an explanation of the molecular mechanisms of opioid tolerance would benefit millions of patients suffering from acute or chronic pain, non-specific critical illnesses, or drug dependence and addiction, thus becoming a crowning achievement for modern medicine and basic science.
