The pimeloyl-CoA synthase from *Bacillus sphaericus* has been purified to homogeneity from an overproducing strain of *Escherichia coli*. The purification yielded milligram quantities of the synthase with a specific activity of 1 unit/mg of protein. Analysis of the products showed that this enzyme catalysed the transformation of pimelate into pimeloyl-CoA with concomitant hydrolysis of ATP to AMP. Using a continuous spectrophotometric assay, we have examined the catalytic properties of the pure enzyme. The pH profile under \( V_{\text{max}} \) conditions showed a maximum around 8.5. Apparent \( K_m \) values for pimelate, CoASH, ATP·Mg²⁻ and Mg²⁺ were respectively 145 μM, 33 μM, 170 μM and 2.3 mM. The enzyme was inhibited by Mg²⁺ above 10 mM. This acid-CoA ligase exhibited a very sharp substrate specificity, e.g. neither GTP nor pimelate analogues (di- or mono-carboxylic acids) were processed. The bivalent metal ion requirement was also investigated: Mn²⁺ (73 %) and Co²⁺ (32 %) but not Ca²⁺ could replace Mg²⁺. The enzyme was inhibited by metal chelators such as 1,10-phenanthroline and EDTA. The synthase was a homodimer with a 28000-Mr subunit. N-Terminal sequencing definitely proved that this enzyme was encoded by the bioW gene. A careful study of pimelate uptake by *B. sphaericus*, *E. coli* and *Pseudomonas denitrificans* showed that this metabolite crossed the membrane of these microorganisms by passive diffusion, ruling out the involvement of the bioX gene product as pimelate carrier.

### INTRODUCTION

The metabolic pathway leading to biotin has been elucidated in *Escherichia coli* and *Bacillus sphaericus* [1,2]. The first common intermediate of this pathway, in these two bacteria, is pimeloyl-CoA (Scheme 1). Indeed, the transformation of pimeloyl-CoA to 8-amino-7-oxononanoate has been demonstrated in cell-free extracts of *E. coli* [3], *B. sphaericus* [4] and other bacteria [5], and we have recently reported the first purification to homogeneity of the 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (EC 2.3.1.47) [6]. On the other hand, the origin of pimeloyl-CoA is not clear in all the bacteria so far studied. Izumi and coworkers have shown that a pimeloyl-CoA synthase activity, using pimelate as substrate, could be detected in various cell-free extracts [7], including those from *E. coli*, using a coupled assay with 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase. They also partially characterized this activity in *Bacillus megaterium* using a partially purified (34-fold) preparation [8,9]. However, the presence of this enzyme in *E. coli* has been questioned by several groups [1,10].

We have elucidated and sequenced the bio genes in *B. sphaericus* and showed that all the activities required for the transformation of pimelate into 8-amino-7-oxononanoate were encoded by the bioXWF cluster [10]. Although bioF was identified as the 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase gene, confirmed by the characterization of the pure synthase, initial genetic experiments suggested that bioW was involved in pimeloyl-CoA biosynthesis, i.e. a weak complementation was observed when bioC and bioH *E. coli* mutants, transformed with a plasmid harbouring the bioW gene, were grown on pimelate-supplemented medium [10]. No specific role could be attributed to bioX, although the hydrophobic character of the encoded protein suggested a membrane-bound protein (a permease for pimelate?).

MgCl₂, 25.0 mm-L-alanine, 0.1 mm-pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), 0.1 m-unit of 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (purified as previously described [6]), 0.2 M-NaCl, 50 mM-Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, in a total volume of 45 μl. The Tris buffer was carefully de-aerated to avoid CoASH oxidation. The reaction was initiated by the addition of pimeloyl-CoA synthase (5 μl), after which the mixture was rapidly vortexed, and incubated at 30 °C. The reaction was quenched at various times (30 s to 10 min) by the addition of trichloroacetic acid [5 % (w/v) final concentration]. 8-Amino-7-oxononanoate concentration was then determined using the *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* bioassay [6].

Procedure B: this determination is based on the appearance of the thioester bond at 230 nm (ε₂₃₀ 4500 M⁻¹·cm⁻¹) [14]. The quartz cuvette contained 1.5 mM-disodium pimelate, 0.1 mM-CoASH, 0.4 mM-ATP, 10.0 mM-MgCl₂, 0.2 M-NaCl, 50 mM-Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, (de-aerated) in a total volume of 400 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of pimeloyl-CoA synthase (5 μl) and the absorbance at 230 nm was recorded as a function of time, at 30 °C.

One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme which catalyses the formation of 1 μmol of pimeloyl-CoA per min in the conditions described for procedure B.

### Protein assay

Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford [15] using the reagent supplied by Bio-Rad. BSA fraction V, from Sigma, was used as a standard.

### Identification of the products

The reaction mixture was as described above for procedure B. After the absorbance at 230 nm had reached a constant value (ΔA₂₃₀ 0.45), the products (25 μl of the mixture) were separated by reverse-phase h.p.l.c. [LiChrospher 100 RP-8 5 μm (Merck), detection at 260 nm, flow rate of 1 ml/min]. For the separation of ATP, ADP and AMP, we used a linear gradient (15 min) from 1 % acetonitrile in 0.2 M-triethylamine phosphate buffer (TEAP), pH 5.5, to 5 % acetonitrile in 0.2 M-TEAP, pH 5. For the identification of pimeloyl-CoA we used a linear gradient (20 min) from 6 % acetonitrile in 0.2 M-TEAP, pH 5.5, to 12 % acetonitrile in 0.2 M-TEAP, pH 5.5. These identifications were confirmed by the use of an anion-exchange column (f.p.l.c. MonoQ HR 5/5, Pharmacia): detection at 260 nm, flow rate of 1 ml/min, linear KCl gradient (0–0.5 M, 15 min) in 40 mM-potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.

### Culture

E. coli C268/pTG3403 was grown in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 ml batches) at 37 °C in the following medium (per litre): K₂HPO₄ 1 g, KCl 0.5 g, MgSO₄·7H₂O 0.5 g, FeSO₄·7H₂O 10 mg, MnSO₄·7H₂O 10 mg, Proteose Peptone 10 g, Casamino Acids 3 g, thiamin HCl 0.02 mg, glycerol 20 g, pH 6.8. Ampicillin was sterilized by filtration and added at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Cells were harvested at early stationary phase by centrifugation (4000 g, 15 min) and washed with 0.4 M-NaCl, 50 mM-KH₂PO₄, pH 7.0, 50 mM-MgSO₄·7H₂O. After centrifugation (4000 g, 15 min) cells were kept at –20 °C until use.

### Enzyme purification

All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C.

Crude extract. The cells were thawed on ice and suspended in buffer A (20 mM-Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM-2-mercaptoethanol, 20 % (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM-EDTA, 1 mM-phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride, 1 μM-pepstatin A) and disrupted by sonication for 5 min (five 1 min pulses with intermittent 1 min cooling periods). The cellular debris were removed by centrifugation (27000 g, 20 min).

Biotin biosynthesis in *Bacillus sphaericus*

Precipitation. The supernatant was made up to an ammonium sulphate concentration of 1.4 M by the slow addition of crystals, and then stirred for 30 min. After centrifugation (27000 g, 15 min) the supernatant was made up to 2.8 M-ammonium sulphate by the further addition of crystals, stirred for 30 min and centrifuged (27000 g, 15 min). The pellet was dissolved in 50 ml of buffer B [20 mM-Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM-2-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM-EDTA, 3 M-NaCl].

Phenyl-Sepharose. The enzyme solution was loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (2.5 cm × 18 cm) equilibrated with buffer B. The proteins were eluted using a linear gradient (3–0 M-NaCl in buffer B; 2 × 200 ml) followed by a wash with 100 ml of buffer C (buffer B without NaCl). Active fractions were pooled.

Reactive-Red–Agarose. The enzyme solution was loaded on to a Reactive-Red–Agarose column (2.5 cm × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer C. After washing the column with 100 ml of buffer C the proteins were eluted using a linear salt gradient (0–4 M-NaCl in buffer C; 2 × 200 ml). Active fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon P 10) and dialysed against buffer D (20 mM-Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM-2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM-EDTA).

F.p.l.c. on Mono Q. The enzyme was purified by portions on a Mono Q HR 5/5 f.p.l.c. (Pharmacia) column using a biphasic linear salt gradient (0–0.15–0.4 mM-NaCl in 10 mM-Tris/HCl, pH 8.0). Active fractions were pooled and concentrated (centriprep 10 Amicon).

F.p.l.c. on Superose 12. The enzyme was finally purified by gel filtration on an f.p.l.c. Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Pharmacia) column using buffer C as the solvent. The enzyme was stored at –20 °C without loss of activity.

$M_r$ determination

The subunit $M_r$ was determined by SDS/PAGE [16] (15%) with the following $M_r$ standards: BSA 66000, ovalbumin 45000, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 36000, carbonic anhydrase 29000, trypsinogen 24000, trypsin inhibitor 20100, α-lactalbumin 14200. The proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The native $M_r$ was determined by gel permeation chromatography on a Sephadex G-100 column (1.6 cm × 80 cm) using 20 mM-potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, as the solvent. The $M_r$ standards utilized were the following: Blue Dextran, void volume; alcohol dehydrogenase, 150000; BSA, 66000; carbonic anhydrase, 29000; cytochrome c, 12400; aprotinin, 6500.

N-Terminal sequence determination

Sequencing was performed by Dr. J. P. Le Caer (CNRS, Gif sur Yvette, France) on an Applied Biosystems apparatus (Foster City, CA, U.S.A.).

Isoelectrofocusing

The isoelectric point was determined on a polyacrylamide gel using a 3–10 pH gradient (Biolyte from Bio-Rad). The bands were stained with Coomassie Scarlet 7B and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Standards were from Bio-Rad.

Uptake experiments

*B. sphaericus* and *E. coli* were grown to mid-exponential phase at 37 °C, in LB [17], GP [7] or M9 [17] medium supplemented with 2 g of Casamino Acids/l. Disodium pimelate was at a concentration of 0.5 g/l when added. *P. denitrificans* was grown to mid-exponential phase at 30 °C, in (per litre): Bactopeptone 20 g, MgCl₂,6H₂O 1.4 g, K₂SO₄ 10 g, glycerol 10 g, pH 7.0. The cells were collected by centrifugation (4000 g for 10 min) and washed twice with solution A (0.4 M-NaCl, 50 mM-KH₂PO₄, pH 7.0, 50 mM-MgSO₄). In all cases the cells were resuspended in sufficient M9 medium without glucose and without Casamino-Acids, but supplemented with 100 μg of chloramphenicol/ml, so that the cell content was 4 × 10⁹ cells/ml. Glucose was at 2% (w/v) and glycerol at 3% (v/v) when added.

The uptake was started by the addition of \[^{14}C\]pimelate and the cells were gently shaken at 37 °C (30 °C for *P. denitrificans*). Control experiments were performed with boiled cells (10 min at 100 °C). Aliquots (100 μl) were removed at various times and rapidly filtered on a cellulose acetate filter (0.45 μm pore size; Sartorius). The filter was then immediately washed three times with 3 ml of warm solution A, dried at 60 °C and counted for radioactivity in 10 ml of scintillation liquid (Aquasol-2 from Du Pont). Countings were corrected for quenching by the external standard method.

The intracellular volume of *B. sphaericus* was measured using \[^{14}C\]inulin as described for *E. coli* by Winkler & Wilson [18].

### RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

#### Assays

Izumi *et al.* [9] have described a discontinuous coupled assay for pimelyl-CoA synthase using 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase. Although very sensitive (in the picomolar range), the microbiological determination of 8-amino-7-oxononanoate is tedious and not very accurate [6]. Indeed, the growth of the test organism requires at least 15 h and the manual measurement of growth diameters limits its accuracy [6]. We have thus used a continuous assay for the pimelyl-CoA synthase based on the appearance of the thioester-bond chromophore ($\epsilon_{230}$ 4500 M⁻¹·cm⁻¹) which is less sensitive than the former but more accurate and much easier to set up. Using this assay, progress curves were linear over 5 min and the calculated initial velocities showed a linear response over a wide range of enzyme concentrations (results not shown). This assay was used throughout this study unless otherwise stated.

#### Purification

The *B. sphaericus* pimelyl-CoA synthase was purified from an overproducing strain, *E. coli* C268, containing the synthase-cloned gene downstream of a lactose promoter inserted into plasmid pTG3403 (R. Gloeckler, unpublished work). Overproduction led to about 2% of the soluble proteins in *E. coli* being the synthase. Table 1 summarizes the purification, which permitted the isolation of the enzyme in milligram quantities with a specific activity of about 1 unit/mg. This value is at least 1000-fold higher than that reported for the *B. megaterium* enzyme preparation, which was not homogeneous [9].

Glycerol, EDTA and 2-mercaptoethanol efficiently stabilized the enzyme, which showed a slow inactivation in their absence, and thus were used throughout the purification. The Phenyl-Sepharose/Reactive-Red sequence was very efficient (see Table 1) leaving only small contaminants which were removed using the f.p.l.c. columns, yielding an electrophoretically pure enzyme (Fig. 1). However, we observed a poor recovery after the f.p.l.c. columns, probably owing to non-specific hydrophobic interactions on the matrices.

#### Product analysis

Analysis of the products using reverse-phase h.p.l.c. and anion-exchange chromatography (f.p.l.c.) showed the presence of pimelyl-CoA and AMP. No ADP could be detected. The reaction can thus be written as shown in Scheme 2 and the enzyme classified as an acid-CoA ligase (AMP-forming). The 1984 edition of the IUB Enzyme Nomenclature [24] has classified this enzyme as the 6-carboxyhexanoate-CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.14)

Fig. 2. pH profile of the pimeloyl-CoA synthase activity  
Conditions were as described under the Experimental section, except that the buffers used were the following: □, 50 mM-potassium phosphate; ■, 50 mM-Tris/HCl; ○, 50 mM-glycine/NaOH. Ionic strength was kept constant (0.25 M) by the addition of KCl.

Scheme 2. Reaction catalysed by pimeloyl-CoA synthase  
[systematic nomenclature: 6-carbohexanoate: CoA ligase (AMP-forming)], on the basis of the work of Izumi et al. [7,8]. However, a careful reading of these reports reveals that there is no evidence at all for the formation of ADP or AMP upon hydrolysis. To our knowledge the results reported here are the first evidence for a systematic classification. Fortunately, the nomenclature proposed in 1984 is correct.

Catalytic properties  
The pH profile of the catalysis under $V_{\text{max}}$ conditions was bell-shaped with a maximum around pH 8.5–9.0 (Fig. 2). No activation was detected using different buffers [Tris/HCl, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulphonic acid (Ches)/HCl or glycine/NaOH] although borate buffer slightly inactivated the enzyme.

Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined using the direct linear plot [19] (Fig. 3). Experimental conditions were as described for procedure B, i.e. 1.5 mM-pimelate, 0.1 mM-CoASH, 0.4 mM-ATP and 10.0 mM-Mg²⁺ except when varied. Apparent

Specificity  
The specificity of the synthase was examined using nucleotide and pimelate analogues and various bivalent cations (Table 2). GTP was a very poor substrate for the pimeloyl-CoA synthase and, as expected, no activity was observed using AMP. Izumi et al. reported that ADP could replace ATP in the reaction catalysed by the *B. megaterium* enzyme (relative activity 80 %) [9], but we found it inactive towards the *B. sphaericus* enzyme. Contrary to findings with other acid-CoA ligases [22], the pimeloyl-CoA

$K_m$ values for pimelate, ATP·Mg²⁻, CoASH were respectively 145 $\mu$M, 170 $\mu$M and 33 $\mu$M. For the $K_m$ determination of CoASH, because the progress curves were not linear when the CoASH concentration was less than 50 $\mu$M, we used the approximation proposed by Lee & Wilson [20]. To keep the Mg²⁺ concentration constant when the ATP·Mg²⁻ concentration was varied, a constant excess of 10 mM-MgCl₂ over the ATP concentration was used [21]. When the Mg²⁺ concentration was varied from 2 mM to 10 mM, conditions in which the ATP·Mg²⁻ concentration is constant [21], an apparent $K_m$ of 2.3 mM was found, but, as already noted for the *B. megaterium* enzyme [9], inhibition was observed at higher Mg²⁺ concentrations. Assuming an apparent $V_{\text{max}}$ of 1 unit/mg we calculated a $k_{\text{cat}}$ of 0.4 s⁻¹, giving an apparent $k_{\text{cat}}/K_m$ of $3 \times 10^3$ M⁻¹·s⁻¹, for pimelate.

Initial velocities were determined using procedure B. (a) Pimelate concentration was varied; 1.6 m-units of enzyme was used in each assay; $K_{\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{app.}} = 145 \, \mu \mathrm{M}$; $V_{\mathrm{max.}}^{\mathrm{app.}} = 4.7 \, \mu \mathrm{M} / \mathrm{min}$. (b) CoASH concentration was varied; 1.6 m-units of enzyme was used in each assay; $K_{\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{app.}} = 33 \, \mu \mathrm{M}$; $V_{\mathrm{max.}}^{\mathrm{app.}} = 5.7 \, \mu \mathrm{M} / \mathrm{min}$. (c) ATP·Mg²⁻ concentration was varied; 1.3 m-units of enzyme was used in each assay; $K_{\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{app.}} = 170 \, \mu \mathrm{M}$; $V_{\mathrm{max.}}^{\mathrm{app.}} = 4.8 \, \mu \mathrm{M} / \mathrm{min}$. (d) Free Mg²⁺ concentration was varied; 1.3 m-units of enzyme was used in each assay; $K_{\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{app.}} = 2.3 \, \mathrm{mm}$; $V_{\mathrm{max.}}^{\mathrm{app.}} = 3.9 \, \mu \mathrm{M} / \mathrm{min}$.

Fig. 4. Pimelate uptake by *Bacillus sphaericus*

(a) Time course of pimelate (3.2 mm) uptake by *B. sphaericus*. □, Control experiment with boiled cells; ●, uptake in the absence of energy source; ○, uptake in the presence of glucose. The addition of glycerol gave similar results (see text). (b) Effect of pimelate concentration on the initial velocities measured during the first 5 min of the uptake. The linearity was observed at concentrations up to 20 mm (results not shown).

megaterium enzyme [9], metal chelators such as EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline were inhibitors of the pimeloyl-CoA synthase: 50% inhibition at 10 mm for EDTA and 50% inhibition at 25 µM for 1,10-phenanthroline.

### Molecular properties

SDS/PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme (Fig. 1) showed a single band with an $M_r$ of 28000, in accordance with the molecular mass deduced from the bioW gene sequence [10]. On gel-permeation chromatography (Sephadex G-100) the native enzyme was eluted as a single peak at $M_r$ 60000, suggesting a homodimeric structure for the active synthase. The u.v./visible spectrum of the pure enzyme did not reveal the presence of any chromophore or cofactor. Isoelectrofocusing of the pure enzyme using a 5–7 pH gradient gave a band centred at pH 6.8 (results not shown).

### N-Terminal sequence

N-Terminal sequencing (15 cycles: MLICYSIRMRAAEKN) confirmed the purity of our preparation and is consistent with the sequence predicted from the bioW gene [10]. This result, together with the molecular mass analysis, definitely proves that the pimeloyl-CoA synthase is encoded by the bioW gene. Thus the bioX gene, immediately upstream of bioW, is not involved in the transformation of pimelate into pimeloyl-CoA as we originally assumed. The sequence of the pimeloyl-CoA synthase was compared with the NBRF-PIR library but no significantly similar proteins were found. Sequence analysis of the protein encoded by bioX showed a strong hydrophobic character consistent with a

synthase did not accept alternative substrates for pimelate. Among the dicarboxylic acids (C₄–C₈) we only detected some activity with adipic acid. None of the monocarboxylic acids we tested (C₆ and C₇) was a suitable substrate. This sharp specificity suggests a unique role for the pimeloyl-CoA synthase, i.e. biotin biosynthesis. The requirement for bivalent metal ions was also examined. Using the coupled assay with the 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (because of high absorption at 230 nm) we found that Mn²⁺, and to a lesser extent Co²⁺, could replace Mg²⁺. No activity was observed with Ca²⁺. As noted for the B.

membrane-bound protein. This prompted us to investigate pimelate uptake by *B. sphaericus*, as the *bioX* gene product could be a permease.

**Pimelate uptake**

This problem was first addressed by Pai & McLaughlin in 1960 using *E. coli* K12 and *P. denitrificans* cells [23]. These authors noted that whereas *E. coli* cells were not permeable to pimelate, *P. denitrificans* showed a significant uptake. Whether this uptake was processed by a permease and is therefore energy-dependent was not investigated. We thus decided to check more precisely the permeability of *B. sphaericus*, *E. coli* and *P. denitrificans* cells to pimelate.

The time course of the uptake by *B. sphaericus* is shown in Fig. 4. Although this process was slow, a significant plateau was reached after 1 h. Assuming a volume of 2.6 μl per mg of dry weight for *B. sphaericus*, the internal concentration of pimelate reached after 1 h was close to the external concentration. Neither the rate nor the steady-state plateau was modified by the addition of energy sources (glucose or glycerol). Furthermore, induction of a putative permease was not detected when the cells were grown in the presence of pimelate as an alternative carbon source or in different growth media (LB, GP). Initial velocities measured during the first minutes of the uptake showed a linear dependence on the pimelate concentration over a wide range (up to 20 mM). This suggests the absence of any permease for pimelate and that this metabolite probably crosses the membrane by passive diffusion.

Pimelate uptake was also investigated in *E. coli* cells. We confirmed that the uptake was not significant with *E. coli* K12 or *E. coli* C268: after 1 h the radioactivity accumulated by the cells was not significantly higher than the background. When *E. coli* C268, transformed with a plasmid bearing the *bioXWF* cluster under the tetracycline promoter (pTG1446; R. Gloeckler, unpublished work), was used, the uptake was not enhanced. However, when grown in the presence of exogenous pimelate *E. coli* C268/pTG1446 was able to metabolize this compound into 8-amino-7-oxononanoate, confirming a slow but real uptake (O. Ploux & R. Gloeckler, unpublished work).

Finally, pimelate uptake was studied in *P. denitrificans*. We confirmed that the uptake was faster as compared with *E. coli* and *B. sphaericus* (the steady-state plateau was reached within 10 min). Initial velocity studies showed that the process was passive diffusion (no energy dependence and no saturation kinetics; results not shown).

In conclusion, pimelate crosses the membrane of these different bacteria by passive diffusion without involving any carrier

protein. This rules out our second hypothesis concerning the role of the *bioX* gene product. Whether this gene is involved in pimelate biosynthesis remains to be established by genetic studies and experiments *in vitro*.
