### Abstract

Apical-basal polarity and a highly organized actin cytoskeleton are main characteristics of epithelial cells that support exchange of ions and nutrients from one body compartment to another. The junctional complexes, localized to the apical end of the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane, are not simply epithelial barriers in paracellular transport or fences preventing diffusion of integral proteins in the plasma membrane, but also contain proteins involved in the maintenance of the physiologic epithelial cell state and signal transduction. Claudin-based tight junctions and E-cadherin-based adherens junctions have been extensively studied. Nectins, along with a unique scaffolding protein, afadin, form homophilic and heterophilic *trans*-dimers and play a key role in identifying cell partners in the primordial cell–cell adhesion. Nectin-based cell–cell adhesion participates in the epithelial morphogenesis, both independently and cooperatively with claudin-based tight junctions and cadherin-based adherens junctions. This review discusses how these adhesion systems interact with each other to form apical junctional complexes, and how they reorganize the actin cytoskeleton in a multistage process of cell adhesion, migration, and polarization.

Fig. 1. Organization of simple columnar epithelia. (A) Epithelial cells attach to adjacent cells via TJs (purple rectangles), AJs (green rectangles), and desmosomes (orange/yellow rectangles), and to the basement membrane by focal contacts (blue rectangles). The apical junctional complexes comprised of TJs and AJs are undercoated with F-actin. TJs contribute to the maintenance of apical (red lines)-basolateral (blue lines) polarity. Desmosome is undercoated with intermediate filaments. (B) Composition of TJs and AJs. TJs are composed of transmembrane proteins (occludin, claudins, and JAMs) linked to the actin cytoskeleton via cytoplasmic ZO proteins. AJs are composed of the nectin-afadin system and the E-cadherin-α-catenin system. Nectin’s direct interacting partner, afadin (pink oval), binds to several proteins. It associates with ZO proteins via an unknown protein X, and with α-catenin via an unknown protein Y. E-Cadherin’s direct interacting partner, β-catenin, binds to α-catenin. Thus, TJs and AJs may be closely associated to form the apical junctional complex and linked to the actin cytoskeleton network by the ability of afadin to interact with ZO proteins and α-catenin.

interconnected strands that circumscribe the apex of lateral membranes of adjacent cells [5]. These sealing strands correspond to fusion sites of apposing plasma membranes and are composed of transmembrane adhesion proteins. AJs form continuous adhesion belts localized near the apical end of the cell, just below TJs. The function of AJs, however, is less apparent than that of TJs because the opposing cell membranes are 15–20 nm apart at AJs. Another conspicuous feature of AJs is the greater density of the cytoplasm adjacent to the junctional membranes. This density may represent the presence of many proteins involved in binding actin filaments (F-actin) to the membrane and in transducing extracellular and intracellular signals. Thus, AJs play roles in stabilizing TJs and also serve as regulatory centers for coordinating multiple cellular processes.

Understanding the functional architecture of TJs and AJs has been achieved by identifying key components of adhesion systems (Table 2) (Fig. 1). Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are responsible for the mutual recognition and adhesion of similar cells in an epithelium. In general, two homophilic CAMs in the plasma membranes of adjacent cells bind to one another extracellularly, and they are attached, via adaptor proteins, to the intracellular cytoskeletal filaments. A variety of CAMs and adaptor proteins have been identified at TJs and AJs [6,7]. It remains largely unknown how epithelial cells recognize the neighboring cells, recruit CAMs to cell-cell contact sites, and finally organize the mature junctional complexes. It also remains uncertain how alterations at each stage of these processes could lead to cell dysfunction and ultimately a pathologic state. It seems clear, however, that the CAMs and relevant proteins at the junctional complexes are likely to be involved in the formation and maintenance of epithelial and endothelial sheets. This review emphasizes the

### 2.1. Occludin, claudins, and JAMs at TJs

Three distinct types of transmembrane proteins have been localized to TJs: occludin [8], claudins [9], and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) [10]. Occludin was the first protein identified within TJ strands. Occludin has four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops, with the N- and C-termini facing the cytoplasm (see Fig. 1., Feldman et al., this issue). Immunoelectron microscopic studies have revealed that occludin is associated with the TJ strand itself [11]. In vitro transfection studies with deletion mutants of occludin have demonstrated that the last ~150 amino acids of the C terminus are required for its localization at TJs [12]. However, the overexpression of chick full-length occludin in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) strain II epithelial cells paradoxically causes an increase in the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) as well as an increase in the paracellular flux to tracers [13,14]. Even a C-terminally deleted chick occludin mutant expressed in MDCK cells is correctly targeted to TJs, but also paradoxically increases the TER as well as the paracellular flux to tracers [13]. An in vivo study has also demonstrated that when the RNAs of truncated occludin constructs are injected into Xenopus embryos, the truncated occludin is correctly targeted to TJs, but the barrier function is disrupted [15]. Thus the role of occludin in the barrier or fence functions of TJs appears to be inconclusive. Knockout studies, however, clearly indicate that occludin is not an essential requirement to generate TJ strands. Embryonic stem cells lacking both alleles of the occludin gene still develop a normal network of TJ strands between adjacent epithelial cells of differentiated embryonic bodies [16].

TJs are thought to be membrane microdomains or raft-like compartments; the TJ itself is composed of microdomains. The raft is a dynamic assembly of cholesterol and sphingolipids in the plasma membrane that play an important role in the spatial organization of TJs. Since hyperphosphorylated occludin is identified in major pools of microdomains and forms a complex with the zonula

### 2. Constituent molecules in the apical junctional complexes

TJs, AJs, and desmosomes of epithelial cells are collectively called junctional complexes. Both TJs and AJs are linked by cytoplasmic proteins to the actin cytoskeleton and signaling elements. TJs are composed of three CAMs, and AJs are composed of at

Fig. 2. Interactions between F-actin and protein components of TJs and AJs. JAM, nectin, and E-cadherin form the apical junctional complex by the interaction of cytoskeletal adaptor proteins (ZO proteins, afadin, and β-catenin) which in turn bind to the actin cytoskeleton, directly or indirectly via some F-actin-associated proteins such as IQGAP, α-actinin, and vinculin.

occludens (ZO)-1 protein [17], occludin probably takes part in the regulation of paracellular permeability in epithelial cells. ZO-1 is a well-characterized PDZ-domain protein (named for the first three proteins in which they were found: PSD-95; the fly septate-junction protein, Discs large; and the mammalian TJ protein, ZO-1) that is a member of the ZO proteins, which are TJ-specific and are membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs (MAGUK).

Following the studies on occludin, claudins have been identified as important structural and functional components of TJs involved in paracellular transport. Claudins are localized to the site of close membrane apposition within TJs. They are detected in both epithelial and endothelial cells in all tissues that bear TJs, and form a complex with occludin and JAMs (Fig. 1). Claudins are small proteins of 20–24 kDa, with two extracellular domains, four transmembrane domains, and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini. The C-terminus of most claudins ends in a putative PDZ-binding domain, and claudins interact directly with the first PDZ domains of ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 [18]. Claudins interact indirectly with the myosin-binding molecule cingulin [19]. Expression of claudin-1 and claudin-2 into mouse L fibroblasts lacking TJs induces the formation of the TJ strands that are morphologically similar to the epithelial TJ strands. The overexpression of claudin-1 increases TER with variable effects on mannitol flux in MDCK cells [20,21], while overexpression of claudin-2 decreases TER in MDCK cells [22]. Fusion proteins of claudin, GFP-claudin-1 have recently shown claudin to form paired TJ strands that are reorganized dynamically [23]. More than 20 members of claudins have been identified in humans [24] that share several essential features, and some claudins have very restricted and different distribution patterns among cell types and tissues [25–28], suggesting their tissue-specific physiologic properties. The presence of distinct species of
claudins may point to a high degree of complexity of TJ assembly.

Characterization of the claudins in vivo is beginning to offer functional insights. Mice lacking claudin-11 (also known as Occludin Sertoli Protein) have demonstrated the absence of TJ strands in myelin sheets of oligodendrocytes and Sertoli cells in the testis [29]. They show male sterility as well as delayed axonal conduction rates in the central nervous system. Defects in claudins are causatively associated with a variety of human diseases. Human mutations of claudin-16 (otherwise known as paracellin-1), a specific claudin found in kidney epithelial cells, show an abnormal paracellular passage of Mg²⁺ ions, resulting in excessive loss of Mg²⁺ in the urine [30]. An autosomal recessive form of deafness is associated with human mutations in claudin-14; this is related to an inability to maintain the special ionic environments in the cochlear duct [31]. Mice lacking claudin-14 are deaf due to rapid degeneration of cochlear outer hair cells [32]. Thus, claudins generate a series of regulated channels within TJ membranes for the passage of ions and small molecules. Furthermore, claudin defects have been implicated in a wide range of human cancer. Altered expressions of claudin-1, claudin-2, claudin-3, and claudin-5 are associated with colon cancer, those of claudin-3 with prostate cancer, and those of claudin-4 with pancreatic cancer.

The third transmembrane protein group JAMs are immunoglobulin (Ig)-like single-span transmembrane molecules and mediate Ca²⁺-independent adhesion [10]. They are concentrated at TJs as well as AJs, not only in polarized epithelial and endothelial cells but also in hematopoietic cells of all lineages [33]. In mouse L cells expressing exogenous JAM (JAM-1), JAM forms planar aggregates at cell–cell adhesion sites, but does not form TJ strand-like structures as observed with claudins [34]. So far, four members of JAMs have been identified. JAM-1 is colocalized with F-actin at the cell–cell contacts and at the membrane ruffles, but not at the stress fibers in cells in culture. JAM-1 facilitates cell adhesion through homophilic binding [35], and regulates TJ permeability and lymphocyte trafficking [36] as a ligand of the β2 integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) [37]. Notably, JAM-1 also serves as a reovirus receptor that interacts with the viral attachment protein sigma-1 [36,38,39], which leads to

activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and apoptosis of infected cells. JAM-2 is a vascular molecule expressed by endothelial and lymphatic cells [40]. JAM-2 is localized to endothelial venules within lymph nodes and Peyer patches of adult mice [41], and plays a central role in the regulation of transendothelial migration. JAM-3 expressed in human platelets is identified as a counter receptor for the leukocyte β2-integrin Mac-1 (αMβ2, CD11b/CD18) [42] mediating leukocyte-platelet interactions. JAM-4 is localized to TJs and apical membranes of epithelial cells in the jejunum, ileum, and renal proximal tubules [43]. JAM-4 interacts with MAGI-1 (membrane associated guanylate kinase interacting protein-like 1) a scaffolding protein at TJs, which may regulate the permeability of kidney glomerulus and small-intestinal epithelial cells [44].

The extracellular domains of JAMs consist of two V-type Ig domains. JAM-1 forms homophilic cis-dimers and homophilic trans-dimers, which contributes to adhesive function and junctional organization at TJs. JAM-2 and JAM-3 are heterophilic binding partners [45], although they do not undergo homophilic interactions. JAM-2 adheres to T cells through heterotypic interactions with JAM-3 [46,47]. Neutralizing JAM-3 antiserum and soluble JAM-3 ectodomain inhibit not only JAM-2 binding to JAM-3 but also prevent interactions between JAM-2 and α(4)β(1) integrin on T cells, and the first Ig-like fold of JAM-2 is shown to be competent in binding both JAM-3 and α(4)β(1) integrin counter-receptors [46]. Intracellularly JAMs colocalize with ZO-1 and cingulin [48]. Furthermore JAMs bind to partitioning-defective (PAR) proteins that are identified in *Caenorhabditis elegans* (*C. elegans*) as determinants of asymmetric cell division and polarized cell growth. PAR3, also known as atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isotype-specific interacting protein—ASIP, and PAR6 are two vertebrate orthologues of these proteins and are found to form a signaling complex with the small G proteins Cdc42/Rac1 and with aPKC. JAM-1 binds to PAR3 and makes the PAR3/PAR6/aPKC complex tethered to TJs, indicating that JAMs appear to have a potential role in the generation of epithelial cell polarity [49]. JAM-2 and JAM-3 also directly associate with PAR3 [47], suggesting possible roles for JAMs in endothelial cell polarity as well. Thus, aggregates of JAMs are tethered to claudin-based strands through ZO-1, andthese JAM aggregates recruit PAR3 to TJs [34]. JAMs regulate both leukocyte/platelet/endothelial cell interactions in the immune system and TJ formation in epithelial and endothelial cells during the acquisition of cell polarity [50]. JAMs might be novel molecular targets for antagonizing interactions between hematopoietic and endothelial cells that promote inflammatory vascular pathologies.

Claudins and JAMs have a valine residue at their cytoplasmic C-termini and bind ZO proteins through their PDZ domains, whereas occludin binds them through their guanylate kinase domain [4,10,34,51,52]. Since ZO-1 and ZO-2 are F-actin-binding proteins and form a heterophilic dimer with ZO-3 [4,10], occludin, claudins, and JAMs are all linked to the actin cytoskeleton through these adaptor proteins (Figs. 1 and 2). TJs also concentrate signaling proteins and cell polarity proteins [3,4,53], and serve as a regulatory center to help in coordinating multiple cell processes.

### 2.2. Cadherin-based AJs

The key transmembrane proteins of AJs belong to the family called cadherins consisting of over 80 members [6,54–60]. E-Cadherin, primarily expressed in epithelia, is the prototype and best-characterized member of the family. The extracellular portion of E-cadherin contains five-tandemly-repeated ectodomains, EC1–EC5, which bind Ca²⁺ and serve as a template for homophilic binding with E-cadherin molecules on the surface of neighboring cells. The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin is linked to the actin cytoskeleton and other signaling elements through many peripheral membrane proteins, including catenins, vinculin, and α-actinin [4,7,55,61–63] (Fig. 2). E-Cadherin has the highly conserved cytoplasmic tail consisting of about 150 amino acids. This region contains a binding site for either β-catenin or γ-catenin (plakoglobin), members of the superfamily of armadillo repeat proteins [64]. E-Cadherin and β-catenin form a complex by interaction between the cytoplasmic E-cadherin tail and β-catenin’s 12 repeats of 42 amino acid armadillo sequences. This complex is required for the transport of newly synthesized E-cadherin to the plasma membrane [65]. The N-terminal domain of β-catenin or γ-catenin directly binds α-catenin. Since α-catenin is capable of binding to F-actin itself and to F-actin-binding proteins, such as α-actinin and vinculin, the E-cadherin–catenin complexes are consequently linked to the actin cytoskeleton.

E-Cadherin is involved in the development of AJs that starts with the initial cell–cell contacts formed at the tips of filopodial and lamellipodial projections. E-Cadherin may also act as a precursor for the establishment of TJs at the apical side of AJs, and for gathering around companion molecules, such as cell surface receptors, intracellular signaling molecules, and oncproteins [7,66–68]. The anchoring of E-cadherin and β-catenin complexes to the actin cytoskeleton is apparently the rate-limiting step in adhesion of epithelial cells in culture. Such cases are observed in compaction and formation of the blastocyst during gastrulation, when the blastomeres flatten and increase their contact with each other and develop polarization. The diversity of cytoskeletal dynamics could be required for epithelial integrity within tissues to respond to particular environmental cues, indicating that the E-cadherin-based AJs must have a potentially high binding capacity for F-actin. Classical knock-out studies have demonstrated that E-cadherin-deficient embryos die at the blastocyst stage [69,70]. A conditional gene inactivation using the Cre recombinase under the control of the hormone-inducible MMTV (mouse mammary tumor virus) promoter affects the terminal differentiation of the lactating mammary gland [71].

#### 2.3. Nectin-based cell–cell adhesion and Necls

##### 2.3.1. Nectins

Nectins, named after the Latin word “nectro”, are Ca²⁺-independent Ig-like CAMs. Nectin-based cell–cell adhesions establish and maintain the apical junctional complexes, both independently and cooperating with the cadherin-based AJs. The nectin family consists of four members [72]. Each member has two or three isoforms generated by alternative splicing [73–81]. Nectin-1α and nectin-2α are originally isolated as the poliovirus receptor-related proteins, PRR-1 and PRR-2, respectively, although neither of them has been reported to serve as an actual poliovirus receptor. Later they were identified as receptors for alpha-herpes virus, facilitating its entry and intercellular spread, and then they were renamed
herpes virus entry mediator C (HveC) and B (HveB), respectively.

Nectins have an extracellular region with three Ig-like loops, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail region, except for nectin-1γ that is a secreted protein lacking the transmembrane region. The first Ig-like loop of extracellular region is required for the formation of the trans-dimers, whereas the second Ig-like loop is necessary for the formation of the cis-dimers [82, 83]. The function of the third Ig-like loop is currently unknown. The C-termini of nectins have the consensus sequence A/EXYV and bind the PDZ domain of afadin [84]. Namely nectins are linked to the actin cytoskeleton via afadin, which constitutes a novel nectin–afadin system that organizes AJs cooperatively with the cadherin–catenin system in epithelial cells. The dimer formation of nectins, and the interaction of nectins with afadin are totally independent events. The nectin-mediated cell–cell adhesion appears not so strong as the E-cadherin-mediated adhesion observed in compaction of the blastocyst.

Nectin-1, nectin-2, and nectin-3 are ubiquitously expressed in a variety of cells including epithelial cells, neurons, and fibroblasts [72]. Nectin-2 or nectin-3 is also expressed in hematopoietic cells or spermatids, respectively, where cadherins are not expressed. Nectin-4 is mainly expressed in the placenta in human tissues, although its expression is broader in mouse tissues [81]. In the epithelial cells of the mouse small intestine, nectin-2 and afadin are highly concentrated at AJs, but not at TJs, desmosomes, and cell-matrix AJs. This distribution pattern is different from that of E-cadherin because E-cadherin is widely distributed throughout the lateral membrane of epithelial cells, in addition to AJs [55, 85]. In mouse L cells lacking TJs and stably expressing E-cadherin, nectin-2 and afadin colocalize with E-cadherin at AJs. Nectin-1, nectin-3, and afadin colocalize to cell–cell adhesion sites in NIH3T3 fibroblasts [86]. In epithelial cells and fibroblasts, each nectin localizes symmetrically to both sides of the plasma membrane of the AJs. Each member of nectins forms cis-dimers, which precedes homophilic or heterophilic trans-dimer formation that actually determines the type of cell–cell adhesion. Heterophilic trans-interactions have been detected between nectin-2 and nectin-3, between nectin-1 and nectin-3, and also between nectin-1 and nectin-4. Importantly, the formation of each heterophilic trans-dimer is stronger than that of each homophilic trans-dimer. Such heterotypic nectin-based cell–cell adhesions are found in the testis: between nectin-2 in Sertoli cells and nectin-3 in spermatids at Sertoli–spermatid junctions. Those caused by nectin-1 and nectin-3 are found in the ciliary epithelium of the eye and in the synapses between the mossy fiber terminals and dendrites of pyramidal cells in the CA3 area of the mouse hippocampus. An inhibitor of nectin-1 causes a decrease in synapse size by inhibition of the nectin-based cell–cell adhesion in cultured rat hippocampal neurons [87].

Knock-out studies on nectins show mouse phenotypes consistent with the expression pattern of each member as described. Male mice lacking nectin-2 are infertile because of impaired sperm functions: reductions in migration of spermatids to the oviduct, in spermatozoa–zona binding, and in sperm–oocyte fusion, while heterozygous mice and female homozygous mice are fertile [88]. Since expression of nectin-2 and nectin-3 is detected at Sertoli–spermatid junctions, the mouse phenotype may be caused by a defective heterotypic adhesion complex between Sertoli cells and elongated spermatids. Consistently, male mice lacking nectin-3 are also infertile [Inagaki et al., unpublished]. Since nectin-1 and nectin-3 form the most strong trans-dimers, it seems intriguing that mice lacking nectin-1 or nectin-3 show the overlapping phenotype: small eyes. Adhesion defects in ciliary epithelium of mice lacking nectin-1 are comparable with mice lacking nectin-3, demonstrating heterophilic interactions between them in the formation of ciliary body of the eye. AJs of the retinal external limiting membrane persist along apical planes of non-pigmented epithelium. Apical short TJs are recruited here to form a functional seal. Nectin-1 and nectin-3 are localized to those AJs, but nectin-2 is not. The lesion is normally sealed by apical–apical adhesion of pigmented epithelial cells. The ciliary bodies of the eye are not well developed in these knock-out mice, resulting in the separation of the lens and the iris [89]. Thus, the formation of pigmented epithelium is exclusively dependent on the heterophilic binding between nectin-1 and nectin-3. Nectin-1 and nectin-3 can also be involved in localizing bone morphogenic protein (BMP) receptors because BMP

signaling is also required for ciliary body functions [90]. Since nectin-1 and nectin-3 are asymmetrically localized to the presynaptic and postsynaptic sides of puncta adherentia junctions, respectively, investigation using these knocked-out mice is currently underway at the synapses between the mossy fiber terminals and dendrites of pyramidal cells in the CA3 area of the adult mouse hippocampus.

### 2.3.2. Necls

Necls are defined as nectin-like CAMs that do not bind afadin. They have an extracellular region with three Ig-like loops, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail region. They show homophilic binding as well as heterophilic binding with nectins. Although Necls actually have the PDZ-domain-binding motif in the C-termini, they appear not to bind afadin but to bind other PDZ-domain proteins. Necl-based cell–cell adhesion is Ca²⁺-independent but may play roles quite different from nectins. Necls localized to the basolateral plasma membrane, but not to TJs and AJs, and they can recruit membrane receptors and transducers to mediate signals from growth factors or cytokines.

Five members of Necls have been identified as summarized in (Table 3) [91–101]. The cytoplasmic regions of Necl-1, Necl-2, Necl-3, and Necl-4 show high similarity and have the PDZ-domain-binding motif at the C-termini, although Necl-5 does not have this motif. Necl-1, Necl-2, and Necl-5 do not bind afadin [102], but it remains to be determined whether Necl-3 and Necl-4 interact with afadin. The roles of Necl-2 and Necl-5 have been extensively studied. Necl-2 shows homophilic binding of itself and heterophilic binding to Necl-1 and nectin-3. In animals, Necl-2 is expressed in the mouse gall bladder [103]. While Necl-2 itself is known as a tumor suppressor [96], Necl-2 has a band 4.1-binding motif at the juxtamembrane region and binds tumor suppressor DAL-1 (the allantoinase gene from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* also known as erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1). Thus DAL-1 connects Necl-2 to the actin cytoskeleton [104]. Necl-2 also binds Pals2, a MAGUK family member. Pals2 is known to bind Lin-7 and regulate the proper localization of Let-23 [105], the homolog of mammalian epidermal growth factor receptor, in *C. elegans*. Let-23 receptor tyrosine kinase regulates vulval induction.

Thus, Necl-2 appears to locate a transmembrane protein(s) such as hormone receptors through Pals2 in mammals. Necl-5 shows heterophilic binding with nectin-3 but not homophilic binding of itself [102]. Necl-5 has shown to be a receptor mediating the entry of human poliovirus, porcine pseudorabies virus, and bovine herpesvirus-1. Besides the roles of a CAM and a viral receptor, Necl-5 has recently been shown to regulate cell migration. Necl-5 is overexpressed in colon carcinoma cells of humans, rats, and mice [98,99]. In addition, Necl-5 is markedly overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells transformed by V12Ki-Ras [102]. Studies on cultured cells expressing Necl-5 and its mutants have shown that Necl-5 colocalizes with integrin αVβ3 at leading edges of migrating cells, and that Necl-5 regulates serum-induced cell migration in an integrin-dependent but nectin-3-independent manner [106].

### 2.4. Cytoplasmic adaptor proteins regulating cell–cell adhesion

Adaptor proteins of the junctional complexes usually bind to the C-terminal tail of CAMs in the cytoplasm, and connect them to the actin cytoskeleton directly, or indirectly by recruiting other proteins. They have several protein–protein interaction domains, such as the PDZ domain, so that they can function as scaffolding proteins. PDZ domains recognize hydrophobic motifs of four amino acids at the C-terminal residue of transmembrane proteins. Adaptor proteins described here are all PDZ-domain proteins except catenins.

#### 2.4.1. ZO proteins, PAR proteins, and JEAP

ZO proteins, PAR proteins, and JEAP (junction-enriched and -associated protein) act as adaptors at the cytoplasmic surface of TJs. The ZO proteins bind the TJ transmembrane proteins and F-actin with their N- and C-termini, respectively [107–109]. This complex appears to link TJs to a perijunctional actomyosin ring, which supports and regulates TJ permeability in epithelial cells [3,4,110,111]. ZO-1 links E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton indirectly through α-catenin known as one of many F-actin-binding proteins, or interacts with connexins that are the transmembrane molecules of gap junctions, depending on the cell type. ZO-1 is a 220-kD phosphoprotein that contains three

PDZ domains, an Src-homology (SH) 3 domain, and an inactive guanylate kinase domain [112]. Multidomain ZO proteins could bind several different protein partners to control the dynamics of TJ assembly that requires the clustering of occludin and claudins. A ZO-1-associated nucleic acid-binding protein (ZONAB) associates with the SH3 domain of ZO-1 [113], although the partners for PDZ and SH3 domains of ZO-2 and ZO-3 have not yet been identified. ZO-1 colocalizes with nectin and afadin at the puncta adherens junction in the hippocampus, so that the nectin-afadin system is involved in the localization of ZO-1 [114]. ZO-3 also interacts with p120 catenin and AF-6/afadin, and the amino-terminal half of ZO-3 affects junctional complex assembly and function in MDCK cells [115].

not with typical TJs. The binding affinities of PAR 3 and afadin for nectin-1 and nectin-3 are almost comparable [116], suggesting that nectins, as well as JAMs, play a role in cell polarity. PAR 3 has been shown to form a ternary complex with PAR 6 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) [117, 118]. PAR 3 is localized to TJs in cultured epithelial cells, and localized to AJs outlined by β-catenin and afadin at the luminal surface, an apical end of the neuroepithelium in the developing mouse central nervous system, playing an important role in neural cell differentiation by means of asymmetric cell division. [119].

The junction-enriched and junction-associated protein JEAP is a novel component of TJs that is specifically expressed in exocrine cells [120]. JEAP contains a polyglutamic acid repeat at the N-terminal region, a coiled-coil domain in the middle region, and a consensus motif for binding to PDZ domains at the C-terminal region. Exogenously expressed JEAP colocalizes with ZO-1 and occludin at TJs in polarized MDCK cells, but not with claudin-1, JAMs, or ZO-1 in L cells. Endogenous JEAP localizes to TJs of

The PAR proteins are identified as the C. elegans polarity proteins. PAR 3 is a counterpart of a Drosophila melanogaster homolog Bazooka, and a mammalian homolog mPAR3. PAR 3 binds to JAM-1 in epithelial cells [34], and to nectin-1 and nectin-3 in neuroepithelial cells of the embryonic telencephalon, which are equipped with AJs, but

exocrine cells including the pancreas, submandibular gland, lacrimal gland, parotid gland, and sublingual gland, but not at TJs of epithelial cells of the small intestine or endothelial cells of blood vessels. Although the whole perspective on the components of TJs is currently unknown, the presence of multiple PDZ domains in several TJ proteins could explain the complexity of protein–protein associations.

### 2.4.2. Catenins

α-Catenin regulates the assembly of a number of proteins that link E-cadherin and β-catenin complexes to the actin cytoskeleton. α-Catenin itself can associate with F-actin by direct binding through its C-terminal domain, but it can also associate directly with afadin, α-actinin, vinculin, and the zyxin family members. The binding of α-catenin to afadin can recruit adhesion systems based on E-cadherin and nectins together to the AJs [121]. The binding with α-actinin, vinculin, and the zyxin family members can reinforce the association of E-cadherin-based AJs to F-actin, and also can recruit members of the Ena/Vasp families of profilin–actin binding proteins. These mechanisms are important not only for stabilizing cell–cell adhesion but also for coordinating actin dynamics at these sites [122,123]. β-Catenin prefers E-cadherin to desmosomal cadherins for its binding partner. β-Catenin is also critically involved in Wnt signaling, but a detailed description on this signaling process is beyond the scope of this review. γ-Catenin associates preferentially with desmosomal cadherins, although these two catenins substitute for one another when one is missing [124,125]. p120-Catenin, originally identified as a tyrosine kinase substrate, regulates cadherin-mediated cell–cell adhesion. Binding of the p120 Arm domain to E-cadherin appears to be necessary to maintain adequate cadherin levels for strong adhesion. Several agents including histamine, thrombin, and LPA (lysophosphatidic acid) modulate protein kinase C-mediated serine/threonine phosphorylation of p120, and induce rapid changes in cell–cell adhesion [126].

### 2.4.3. Afadin

Afadin is an F-actin-binding protein molecularly cloned from a rat cDNA library [127]. The key role of afadin is to link nectins to the actin cytoskeleton [128]. Although claudins and cadherins are not the

direct binding partners of afadin, the claudin-based TJs and the cadherin-based AJs can be recruited to the nectin-based cell–cell adhesion sites by the direct or indirect interactions of afadin with ZO-1 or α-catenin. To understand the mechanism, it is necessary to know the molecular structure of afadin (Fig. 3). Afadin consists of two splicing variants: p205 (l-afadin) and p190 (s-afadin). It is l-afadin that links the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane at AJs, because s-afadin lacks the F-actin-binding domain. This short isoform appears to be a rat counterpart of human AF-6 protein that is originally reported as the ALL-1 translocation fusion partner gene product in acute myeloid leukemia, from chromosome 6q27 [129,130]. The l-afadin is ubiquitously expressed in rat tissues, whereas s-afadin is specifically expressed in the brain [127]. Actually s-afadin is localized to the postsynaptic membranes of asymmetric synaptic junctions in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus [131].

Afadin is a multidomain protein with a PDZ domain, two Ras-binding domains, a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, a dilute (DIL) domain, and three proline-rich (PR) domains. The PDZ domain of afadin interacts with the members of nectins and the Eph subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases via their C-termini [132]. Nectins are recruited to the cadherin-based AJs through interaction with afadin [133]. This interaction is necessary for the nectin–afadin complex to cluster at cell–cell contact sites but not for cis-dimerization or trans-interaction between nectins [134]. Although JAMs are reported to bind afadin in a PDZ-domain-dependent manner [51], the validity of this binding remains to be determined. Afadin interacts and clusters with a specific Eph receptor, and is involved in a signaling pathway from an Eph receptor to receptor tyrosine kinase activation at postsynaptic membrane sites of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus [132]. The afadin DIL domain-interacting protein (ADIP) directly binds α-catenin, an F-actin-bundling protein known to be indirectly associated with E-cadherin [134]. Additionally afadin is found to associate with ZO-1, α-catenin, ponsin, profilin, IQGAP1, murine Ryk, cingulin [135,136]. Ponsin is an afadin- and vinculin-binding protein that localizes to AJs. Thus, afadin is linked to the actin cytoskeleton by three ways: the binding to α-catenin, the ponsin–vinculin unit, and the ADIP–α-actinin unit [121,134,137,138]. Afadin could modulate actin

Fig. 3. Transmembrane and cytoskeletal proteins associated with afadin. Afadin (pink oval) has two isoforms, l-afadin and s-afadin. Since s-afadin lacks C-terminal F-actin-binding domain (red box) and the third proline-rich (PR3) domain, it does not have the ability to directly interact with F-actin and ponsin. The PDZ domain of afadin interacts with the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane proteins, nectins and Ephrin receptor, which regulate cell–cell adhesion and communication. Afadin interacts with ZO-1, directly or indirectly, which links nectin-based cell–cell adhesion to TJs based on occludin, claudins, and JAMs. The two Ras-binding domain (RA1, 2) of afadin interact with Rap1 which transduces cell-proliferation signals. Rap1 GAP is also recruited by afadin, although the binding site is unknown. The dilute domain (DIL) of afadin interacts with ADIP that binds to α-actinin. Furthermore, α-catenin and profilin are associated with afadin and can link the nectin–afadin system to the actin cytoskeleton, cooperating with ADIP/α-actinin and ponsin/vinculin units. Thus, there are several redundant pathways that link afadin to the actin cytoskeleton, which further help stabilize the junctional complex.

remodeling proximal to AJ complexes, since profilin activates monomeric actin units for subsequent polymerization steps at barbed ends of F-actin and has been shown to participate in cortical actin assembly [139].

The role of afadin in transducing signals is further supported by the findings that the Ras-binding domains within the N-terminus of afadin interact predominantly with Rap1 [139]. Since s-afadin/AF-6, a possible Ras effector protein, transduces signaling,

the role of afadin in signaling may be independent of its binding activity to the actin cytoskeleton. AF-6 is shown to control integrin-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin by regulating Rap1 activity in conditions induced by SPA-1, a Rap1 G protein activating protein [140]. Canoe (Cno), the *Drosophila* homolog of mammalian junctional protein s-afadin/AF-6, reportedly acts as an effector of Rap1 in vivo [141]. The Bcr kinase phosphorylates s-afadin/AF-6, which subsequently increases the affinity of s-afadin/AF-6 to

Ras. Since s-afadin/AF-6 binds to Bcr via its PDZ domain and to Ras via its Ras-binding domain, afadin/ AF-6 functions as a scaffold protein that links Bcr and Ras to cellular junctions. This trimeric complex is involved in downregulation of Ras-mediated signaling at sites of cell–cell contact to maintain cells in a nonproliferating state [142].

Afadin is crucial for the establishment of intercellular junctions during mouse development. Mice lacking afadin mice show developmental defects at stages during and after gastrulation (E6.5–7.5), including disorganization of the ectoderm, impaired migration of the mesoderm, and loss of somites and other structures derived from both the ectoderm and the mesoderm. Afadin is highly expressed in the ectoderm-derived cells during embryogenesis and plays a key role in proper organization of AJs and TJs of the highly expressing cells, which is essential for proper tissue morphogenesis. [143]. Another knock-out study shows the length of the most apical intercellular junctions is reduced, and basolateral surfaces of those cells are separated by multiple gaps [144].

### 3. Assembly of TJs

Although AJs and TJs are clearly different intercellular junctions, their components can interact with each other. Such interactions have been proposed to be the cue for epithelial polarization [1,145]. For example, the TJ component ZO-1 is associated with AJs, which reflects the interaction of ZO-1 with α-catenin and afadin. Nevertheless, in cells that have TJs, ZO-1 specifically associates with TJs and not AJs. The intercellular junctions have originated from simple cell–cell adhesion complexes, such as the primordial junctions that are seen during junction assembly in vitro model systems or early development of animals, and have evolved into different types such as TJs and AJs [146]. In *Drosophila*, the junctional complexes consist of AJs, the marginal zone or subapical complex, and septate junctions that are the equivalent of vertebrate TJs and act as paracellular diffusion barrier. Interestingly, the evolutionarily conserved component, ZO-1, of vertebrate TJs is not associated with septate junctions but either with the subapical complex or AJs. Thus AJs are likely to be

the archetypes of junctional complexes, and AJ formation may precede TJ formation in epithelial cells. In fact, the assembly of TJs is generally dependent on the formation and maintenance of AJs [147–151]. Here we describe the key findings obtained from cells in culture and integrate them into a working model in which assembly of the apical junctional complexes is triggered by the initiation of cell–cell adhesion by nectins and E-cadherin, resulting in the recruitment of components of AJs (catenins and afadin) and TJs (JAM, occludin, claudins, ZO-1 and PAR3/PAR6/aPKC) to these primordial junctions.

#### 3.1. Interactions between TJ and AJ components

The nectin-based cell–cell adhesions are associated with the E-cadherin-based AJs through their respective adaptor proteins, afadin and α-catenin. Nectin and E-cadherin are likely to form AJs cooperatively, which subsequently recruit JAMs, claudins, and occludin to form TJs. While the E-cadherin-based AJs are Ca²⁺-dependent and mediated by homophilic interaction of cadherins [6], the nectin-based cell–cell adhesions are Ca²⁺-independent and show unique heterophilic trans-interaction property. Therefore, the nectin-based cell–cell adhesions must have implications different from E-cadherin for the organization of heterotypic AJs and the assembly of TJs. It is probably nectins, but not E-cadherin, that primarily regulate the assembly of AJs because of the difference in kinetics between their trans-dimer formation. When migrating cells recognize their neighboring cells, primordial spot-like junctions are first formed at the tips of cell protrusions [56,62,122] (Fig. 4). These primordial junctions fuse with each other to form short line-like planes, which develop into matured AJs. TJs are further recruited to the apical side of AJs, resulting in epithelial cells with the complete apical junctional complexes. During the formation of the junctional complexes consisting of AJs and TJs in MDCK cells, E-cadherin, α-catenin, β-catenin, and ZO-1 have shown to assemble at the primordial junctions first, and next claudins and occludin have been recruited to form TJs [152–154]. Nectins and E-cadherin can separately form trans-dimers at cell–cell contact sites of filopodia or lamellipodia. However, the nectin-based micro-clusters must be

followed by the recruitment of claudins and occludin, which eventually leads to the establishment of the claudin-based TJs. It remains unknown, however, how TJ and AJ are aligned from the apical to the basal side of the lateral membrane.

This role of nectins in the formation of AJs is supported by the following studies. Overexpression of nectin accelerates the assembly of AJs and TJs in epithelial cells and the formation of AJs in fibroblasts [155, 156]. Conversely, inhibition of the nectin-based cell–cell adhesions by its specific inhibitor, such as glycoprotein D (gD) and Nef, delays the assembly of AJs and TJs in epithelial cells and the formation of AJs in fibroblasts [155, 157, 158]. gD is an envelop protein of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 which specifically binds to nectins and inhibits its trans-interaction with nectin-1 or nectin-3 [159, 160], whereas Nef is a recombinant extracellular fragment of nectin fused to the Fc domain of IgG which forms trans-dimers with cellular nectins and thereby inhibits the formation of the nectin-based cell–cell adhesions [158]. Mutations of nectins are responsible for the phenotypes in knocked-out mice and for diseases in humans such as cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia, Margarita island ectodermal dysplasia and Zlotogora-Oğur syndrome, exhibiting a strikingly broad, flat upper cleft lip with or without cleft palate [161, 162].

## 3.2. Molecular basis for nectin-mediated interaction

The question of how nectins physically associate with cadherins can be addressed by studying the interaction between afadin and α-catenin. Although afadin is known to directly bind α-catenin in vitro, this binding is not strong [121, 137] and seems to require a post-translational modification(s) of afadin and/or unidentified mediator proteins [121, 137]. Except for the direct binding of afadin to α-catenin, two mechanisms can explain the physical link between them: the ponsin–vinculin unit [163] and the ADIP–α-actinin unit [134] (Fig. 2). Ponsin and ADIP (an afadin and α-actinin binding protein) bind to the third PR domain and the DIL domain of afadin, respectively. Vinculin and α-actinin are both α-catenin-binding proteins. Thus, nectins and cadherins associate through these units at the cytoplasmic surface of AJs. Although the typical AJs are undercoated with F-actin bundles in epithelial cells [156],
the assembly of the nectin-based and cadherin-based systems occurs in the absence of F-actin bundles in fibroblasts [86].

ZO-1 can be the key molecule explaining how the nectin–afadin and cadherin–catenin systems regulate the formation of TJs in epithelial cells. ZO-1 associates with the nectin–afadin system in a manner independent of the E-cadherin–catenin system [138]. ZO-1 binds to the N-terminus of afadin and recruits JAMs to the apical side of the nectin-based and E-cadherin-based cell–cell adhesion sites. JAMs are the first member of TJ components to be recruited during the assembly of the junctional complexes of AJs and TJs, and next claudins and occludin follow shortly [49,155,157]. Thus, the interaction between ZO-1 and afadin can initiate the recruitment of TJs to the apical side of AJs, even though it remains unknown whether afadin recruits ZO-1 alone or ZO-1 accompanied by JAM.

The *trans*-interactions of nectins facilitate the formation of the E-cadherin-based AJs and the claudin-based TJs in MDCK cells, as well as induce activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins. It has been shown that a Cdc42 inhibitor, NWASP-CRIB-CAAX, delayed the assembly of AJs and TJs, whereas overexpression of active Cdc42 (V12Cdc42) suppresses the inhibitory effect of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX and accelerates the formation of junctional complexes [164]. Furthermore, the delay of AJs and TJs formation induced by the Cdc42 inhibitor is also suppressed by co-expression of nectin-1 whose *trans*-interaction results in activating endogenous Cdc42. In addition, the formation of the claudin-based TJs requires a greater amount of activated Cdc42 than that of the E-cadherin-based AJs [158]. Thus, signaling from the junctional complexes through the Rho family proteins, Cdc42 and Rac, appears indispensable to proceed to organize AJs and TJs.

### 3.3. Possible implication of Necls in nectin-mediated junctional organization

Necl-2 shows Ca²⁺-independent homophilic cell–cell adhesion activity [92,165] and also shows heterophilic cell–cell adhesion activity with Necl-1 and with nectin-3 [103]. Necl-2 can neither recruit E-cadherin to the Necl-2-based cell–cell adhesion sites nor directly participate in the formation of AJs because it is unable to bind afadin. However, the heterophilic *trans*-interaction between Necl-2 and nectin-3 may provide Necl-2 with the ability to recruit E-cadherin of the opposing cells to the cell–cell adhesion sites formed by Necl-2 and nectin-3. Therefore, Necl-2 can indirectly take part in the formation of AJs through its binding partner. Since the binding between Necl-2 and nectin-3 is considerably weak compared to that between nectins, nectin-1/nectin-3 and nectin-3/nectin-2, such binding would be easily broken and then Necl-2 would be replaced by nectin-1 or nectin-2. The transient interaction between Necl-2 and nectin-3 can help forming the definite heterophilic *trans*-interaction between nectin-3 and nectin-1 or between nectin-3 and nectin-2, and thereby retrieving Necl-2 from the nectin-based and E-cadherin-based cell–cell adhesion sites (*Fig.* 5A). This model suggests the mechanism by which transmembrane proteins associated with Necl-2 should be distributed to the non-junctional region of the basolateral plasma membrane through the function of Pals2.

Necl-5 has been shown to regulate cell migration [102]. When Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells expressing Necl-5 and mouse L cells expressing nectin-3 are cocultured, the heterophilic *trans*-interaction between Necl-5 and nectin-3 enhances the motility of Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells on the monolayer of L cells [102]. However, the motility of Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells is inhibited when they are plated on dishes precoated with the chimeric protein of an extracellular fragment of nectin-3 (56–400 aa) fused to IgG Fc (Nef-3) [106]. Necl-5 localizes with integrins at the leading edges of the cells, and promotes directional cell migration that depends on the dynamic balance of attachment and detachment between cells expressing Necl-5 and nectin-3. This cell migration is inhibited by echistatin (an inhibitor of integrin αVβ3), vitronectin, an integrin αVβ3-binding and αVβ5-binding protein that binds to the extracellular region of Necl-5. Necl-5-mediated cell migration requires signaling from serum factors and integrins, the activation of Cdc42 and Rac, and the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. The cytoplasmic tail region of Necl-5 binds Tctex-1, a subunit of the dynein motor complex [166], which may be involved in regulation of cell motility in cooperation with microtubules [167]. A current model for the Necl-5 function in cell motility is as follows (*Fig.* 5B): a

Fig. 5. Possible roles of Necls and their mode of action in cell–cell adhesion and cell migration. (A) When two migrating cells make contact through their protrusions, Necl-2 initially forms trans-dimers with nectin-3, generating micro-clusters at cell–cell contact sites. The Necl-2 molecule is then segregated from the transient trans-dimer complex, and next replaced by nectin-1, causing the formation of stable heterophilic trans-dimers of nectin-3 with nectin-1. The nectin-based cell–cell adhesion then recruits E-cadherin, forming a mixture of the nectin- and E-cadherin-based cell–cell adhesion. (B) Necl-5-mediated cell migration induced by serum factor receptors and integrins. A cell migrating factor in serum binds to its specific cell surface receptor and transduces a signal to the cytoplasmic tail region of Necl-5, resulting in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia through activation of Cdc42 and Rac, respectively, while integrins activated by vitronectin also induce the similar events. Necl-5-mediated cell migration is inhibited by echistatin, an inhibitor of integrin αVβ3, because Necl-5 colocalizes with integrin αVβ3 at the leading edges of migrating cells.

serum factor binds to its specific cell surface receptor and transduces a signal to the cytoplasmic tail region of Necl-5, resulting in formation of filopodia and lamellipodia through activation of Cdc42 and Rac, respectively, while integrins are activated by vitronectin and induce activation of these events. Since Necl-5 shows homophilic cell–cell adhesion activity and heterophilic cell–cell adhesion activity selectively with nectin-3 [102,168], the described model for Necl-2 is also applicable to Necl-5 (Fig. 5A). Because of its localization at the leading edges of migrating cells, Necl-5 can initially recognize nectin-3 that is distributed along the free surface of the plasma membrane, and forms heterophilic trans-interaction with nectin-3. Such micro-clusters are likely to be formed more rapidly than those of nectins themselves, but they are transient and unstable because of the low affinity between Necl-5 and nectin-3. Necl-5 is eventually replaced by nectin-1 or nectin-2, which forms much stronger binding of nectin-1 or nectin-2 with nectin-3. Initial interaction between Necl-5 and nectin-3 sequentially results in stable heterophilic trans-interaction between nectins, next the recruitment of E-cadherin, and finally the formation of AJs at both sides of protrusions of migrating cells. Therefore, Necl-5 may also play key roles at the leading edges of migrating cells for the formation of cell–cell adhesion.

3.4. Signaling involved in integrity of TJs

Cytoplasmic proteins such as ZO-1 and PAR3 at TJs, and afadin and β-catenin at AJs can mediate signaling to and from the actin cytoskeleton that is basically important in the regulation of TJ and AJ assembly. Among signal transducers concentrated at the junctional complexes, including membrane receptors, their intercellular signaling molecules, oncogene proteins, and tumor suppressor proteins [4,7,10,66,169], the Rho family proteins and protein kinase C isoforms have been demonstrated as the two key molecules in TJ and AJ assembly. The formation of AJs is enhanced by Rho family small G proteins [7], whereas AJs are disrupted by scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF), phorbol esters, and activated Ras and Src oncogenes [7,49]. The nectin–afadin and E-cadherin–catenin systems can reorganize the actin cytoskeleton by recruiting TJ and AJ components, as well as by signaling through Cdc42 and Rac to their downstream effector and the F-actin-binding proteins, and facilitate the maturation of junctional complexes (Fig. 6).

The trans-interactions of nectins recruit c-Src to sites of cell-cell adhesion in MDCK and L cells. Activated c-Src phosphorylates the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor FRG, which, in turn, activates Cdc-42. Those cellular responses are interrupted by Src family kinase inhibitor and RNA interference. Thus nectins are likely to activate Rac and Cdc42 via cSrc and guanine nucleotide-exchange factors, which induces the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia and accelerates the formation of cell-cell AJs [170] (Fig. 6).

The Rho family proteins regulate the assembly and maintenance of TJs and AJs, but many studies suggest that activities of the Rho family protein must be carefully balanced at levels optimal for TJ and AJ integrity. The expression of constitutively activated forms of RhoA and Rac-1 perturbs TJ function in epithelial and endothelial cells [171–176], and micro-injection of C3 into MDCK cells inhibits Rho activity and interferes with the establishment of AJs [171,177]. Furthermore, the regulation of TJs and AJs by the Rho family proteins seems to vary depending on the cell types. The Rho family protein-mediated signaling results in the different morphology even in the same cell. For example, a dominant active mutant of Rac causes adhesion with the interdigitation of the lateral plasma membrane at the apical to the basal region in MDCK cells, whereas a dominant active mutant of Cdc42 causes adhesion without the interdigitation [172,173,175]. Cdc42 and Rac-1 are activated by the initiation of cell–cell contacts formed by the trans-interactions of nectins or E-cadherin. GTP-Cdc42 induces filopodia that matures into primordial spot-like junctions, whereas GTP-Rac induces lamellipodia that leads to line-like junctions [164] (Fig. 7). The non-trans-interacting nectins inhibit both the E-cadherin-induced activation of Rac and formation of intercellular AJs. Its inhibitory effect is suppressed by the trans-interactions of nectins and subsequent Cdc42 activation, which leads to an increase in filopodia and cell–cell contact sites like “fork initiation”. Active Cdc42 also induces Rac activation in cooperation with the trans-interaction of E-cadherin, and then expands and zips the cell–cell adhesion.

Many downstream effectors have been identified for Rac and Cdc42. Some of these effectors are F-actin-binding proteins: IQGAP1 and IRSp53/WAVE for Rac; and IQGAP1, NWASP, and WASP for Cdc42 [145,178]. IQGAP1, a homolog of the Ras GTPase-activating protein, localizes at AJs in epithelial cells. IQGAP1 functions as a molecular link between the Rho family proteins and the actin cytoskeleton, depending on the nectin–afadin system, but not on the E-cadherin–catenin system [135]. During disruption by chelating Ca²⁺ of the E-cadherin-mediated cell–cell adhesion in nectin-1α-transfected MDCK cells, IQGAP1 remains at the residual nectin-1α-based cell–cell adhesion sites where E-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin are not detected. IQGAP1 behaves in accord with nectin-1α during the formation of AJs by increasing Ca²⁺ from a low to a high concentration. The localization of IQGAP1 at the cell–cell adhesion sites is inhibited by gD and Nef-3 that inhibit the trans-interaction of nectins, and by F-actin-disrupting agents, latrunculin A and cytochalasin D, but not by a microtubule-disrupting agent, nocodazole. Nectin-1α and IQGAP1 are concentrated at the cell contact sites on microbeads coated with Nef-3. IQGAP1 is coimmunoprecipitated with nectin-1 and afadin in the presence of a cross linker, but not with E-cadherin and β-catenin. Thus, IQGAP1 local-

Fig. 6. Signaling pathways from the nectin-based and E-cadherin-based AJs lead to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, gene expression, and cell polarity formation. The nectin–afadin and E-cadherin–catenin systems directly regulate organization of the actin cytoskeleton by F-actin-binding proteins such as afadin, α-catenin, α-actinin, and vinculin. On the other hand, they induce activation of Cdc42 and Rac. Activated Cdc42 and Rac regulate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton through their downstream effectors, IQGAP1, IRSp53/WAVE, NWASP, and WASP. Furthermore, they induce gene expression via JNK activation, and facilitate epithelial cell polarity by interaction with PAR6 that forms a complex with PAR3/aPKC.

izes at nectin-1α-mediated cell–cell adhesion sites through the actin cytoskeleton, even though it has been suggested that IQGAP1 localizes at AJs through its binding to β-catenin, and negatively regulates the E-cadherin-mediated cell–cell adhesion [179–181].

GTP-Cdc42 and GTP-Rac also induce activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) cascades [182,183]: ERK, p38 MAP kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. Dominant active mutants of Cdc42 and Rac induce activation of the p38 MAP kinase and JNK cascades, but not the ERK cascade. These small G proteins activate JNK through activation of two JNK kinases, MKK4 and MKK7 [184], and p38 MAP kinase through activation of two p38 MAP kinase kinases, MKK3 and MKK6 [185]. It may be noted that GTP-Cdc42 and GTP-Rac formed by the trans-interactions of nectins selectively induce activation of JNK, but not p38 MAP kinase or ERK [86]. Although it remains unknown why they do not activate p38 MAP kinase or ERK, it could be attributed to the “intracellular compartmentalization” of the MAP kinase pathways. A dominant active mutant of Cdc42 or Rac could supposedly reside in many compartments in the cells except for the nectin-based micro-domains, and could activate p38 MAP kinase as well as JNK. However, the nectin-based micro-domain appears to be linked exclusively to the JNK pathway. Since the JNK signaling pathway is involved in cell-growth control, transformation, and programmed cell death [186], it must be important to clarify the role of the nectin-induced activation of JNK. In contrast, the activation of ERK and p38 MAP kinase is induced upon the formation of the E-cadherin-mediated cell–cell adhesion in Caco-2/15 and HaCat cells, respectively [187,188], although it remains unknown how the trans-interaction of E-cadherin results in the activation of ERK and p38 MAP kinase.

Fig. 7. A fork initiation and zipper model for the formation of AJs by nectins and E-cadherin in epithelial cells. (A and B) Nectins and E-cadherin are diffusely distributed on the free surface of the plasma membrane of migrating cells. When two migrating cells contact through their protrusions, nectins and E-cadherin separately form *trans*-dimers that generate micro-clusters at cell–cell contact sites. *Trans*-interacting E-cadherin activates PI3 kinase and Rac. Non-*trans*-interacting nectins around *trans*-interacting E-cadherin inhibit the activation of Rac induced by the *trans*-interaction of E-cadherin and the Rac-mediated maturation of AJs. The inhibitory effect of non-*trans*-interacting nectins is suppressed by the activation of Cdc42 induced by the *trans*-interactions of nectins, resulting in an increase in the number of filopodia and cell–cell contact sites, like “fork initiation”. (C) GTP-Rac formed by either the *trans*-interactions of nectins or those of E-cadherin induces formation of lamellipodia. The lamellipodia efficiently expand the cell–cell adhesion between the filopodia, and efficiently zip the cell–cell contact sites (so-called “zipper”).

PAR6, were originally identified in *C. elegans*, in which they regulate the anterior–posterior cell polarity of the one-cell embryo [190]. Thereafter, homologs of PAR3 and PAR6 have been identified in *Drosophila* and mammals [53,186]. PAR3 is a PDZ-domain protein that localizes to TJs, and was first identified as an aPKCζ-binding protein in mammals. Notably, PAR3 binds to JAMs and nectins [34,116]. The binding of PAR3 to JAMs mediates its recruitment to TJs [34,49]. PAR3 forms a ternary complex with PAR6 and aPKC in epithelial cells [53], and this PAR3/PAR6/aPKC complex plays a critical role in TJ formation and epithelial polarization. The role of these polarity proteins in epithelial cells has recently been proposed [191,192]. Nectins recruit JAMs to the apical side of AJs, and activate Cdc42, suggesting that nectins play a role in the formation of cell polarity in the following way (Figs. 8 and 9). The *trans*-interactions of nectins recruit E-cadherin to form AJs and then recruit JAMs to the apical side of AJs. On the other hand, they induce activation of Cdc42,

which binds to PAR6. GTP-Cdc42/PAR6 then activates aPKC which then phosphorylates mammalian Lethal giant larvae (mLgl), resulting in release of mLgl from the GTP-Cdc42/PAR6/aPKC complex. The GTP-Cdc42/PAR6/aPKC complex then forms a complex with PAR3, resulting in the association of this multiple complex to JAMs through PAR3. It has been unknown where PAR3 localizes before it binds to JAMs, but a recent analysis indicates that PAR3 binds to nectin-1 and nectin-3, but not nectin-2 [116]. The first PDZ domain of PAR3 binds to the C-terminal four amino acids of nectin-1 and nectin-3. PAR3 may bind to nectins before it binds to JAMs. PAR3 forms a complex with GTP-Cdc42/PAR6/aPKC, which retrieves PAR3 from nectins and then translocates the PAR3/PAR6/aPKC complex to JAMs. Thus Cdc42 appears to be involved in TJ assembly and epithelial polarity by regulating the formation of PAR3/PAR6/aPKC complex.

There are other sets of proteins that establish both AJs and membrane polarity in *Drosophila* [193,194]:

Fig. 8. Interaction between nectins and Necls leads to cell polarity establishment. Nectin and Necl form heterophilic trans-dimers. Nectin binds to afadin as well as PAR3, whereas Necl binds to Pals2 but does not bind to afadin. Polarity establishment is controlled by Cdc42. Cdc42, PAR6, PAR3 and atypical PKC form a complex and regulate TJ assembly to determine apical-basolateral polarity.

Crumbs (Crb), Stardust (Std), and Discs lost (Dlt) which localize at the subapical region of epithelial cells; Scribble (Scrib), Discs large (Dlg), and Lgl which localize at the basolateral region. Mammalian homologs of Crb, Std, Dlt, Pals1, and PATJ localize at TJs [195,196], whereas homologs of Dlg and Lgl localize at the basolateral region [197]. It has recently been shown that the Crb/Pals1/PATJ complex interacts with the PDZ domain of PAR6, and that this interaction is enhanced by binding of GTP-Cdc42 to PAR6 [195], suggesting that the Crb/Pals1 complex is also involved in the regulation of the interaction between mLgl and the PAR6/aPKC complex, and that the PAR6/aPKC complex, together with PAR3,

involves the Crb/Pals1/PATJ complex to promote the formation of TJs [191,192]. Thus, the dissociation of mLgl from the PAR6/aPKC complex is likely to trigger the interaction of the PAR6/aPKC complex with the Crb/Pals1/PATJ complex in addition to its interaction with PAR3 [191,192].

Epithelial layers are shown to be ready to repair damage within moments of injury by the erbB2- heregulin system [198]. Heregulin, a ligand for erbB2, is produced from respiratory epithelial cells and is normally anchored to the outer surface of the apical plasma membrane, whereas erbB2 is localized to the basolateral domains of the same cells. When epithelial cells lose their TJ integrity or are subject to Ca²⁺

Fig. 9. The role and mode of action of nectins in cell polarization in epithelial cells. (A) The nectin-based cell–cell adhesions are mainly formed at the initial stage, and then they recruit E-cadherin, which results in formation of AJs. The *trans*-interactions of nectins induce activation of Cdc42, which binds to PAR6 of the GTP-Cdc42/PAR6/aPKC/mLgl complex. GTP-Cdc42/PAR6 activates aPKC, which phosphorylates mLgl, resulting in release of mLgl from the GTP-Cdc42/PAR6/aPKC complex. (B) Nectins can bind both afadin and PAR3. The GTP-Cdc42/PAR6/ aPKC complex then forms a complex with PAR3 bound to nectins. The *trans*-interactions of nectins recruit JAMs to the apical side of AJs. The Crb/Pals1/PATJ complex also localizes at the apical side of AJs, but the order of recruitment of the Crumb/Pals1/PATJ complex and the GTP-Cdc42/PAR3/PAR6/aPKC complex remains unknown. The Crb/Pals1/PATJ complex interacts with the GTP-Cdc42/PAR3/PAR6/aPKC complex through the direct interaction between Pals1 and PAR6. (C) Claudins and occludin are recruited and eventually lead to establishment of TJs. The cytoplasmic regions of JAMs, claudins, and occludin bind ZO proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3).

removal mimicking diffuse epithelial injury, cells sense their injury and proliferate to replace cells that are lost. Signaling from heregulin is transmitted to erbB2 because there is no barrier function of TJs. Notably, ZO-1 appears to be involved in transcription regulating ErbB-2 expression. Since ZO-1 interacts both with catenins [199,200], ZO-1 probably resides at the AJs. Furthermore, ZO-1 binds to the transcription factor ZONAB that controls the expression of erbB2 [113]. Therefore, it will be intriguing to elucidate the roles for ZO-1 and ZONAB in coordinating the TJ and AJ maintenance.

4. Disassembly of TJs

Several experimental procedures have been invented to disrupt TJs and AJs in cultured epithelial cells, as well as primary cells obtained from animals. These methods are Ca²⁺-chelating methods, ATP depletion, oxidative stress-induced disruption, and scratch or wound-healing assays. Cellular responses to these stimuli have been studied by examining TER, the barrier function that prevents spreading of tracer molecules, the changes in localization and biochemical properties of the junctional components. What we have learned from these studies is that signaling to specific components of TJs and AJs plays important roles for the disassembly of the junctional complexes. Physiological and pathological implications of such signaling to TJs and AJs are manifested in multicellular organisms during the processes of the entry of micro-organisms through the epithelial barrier, the interaction of Sertoli cells with spermatocyte in the testis, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and cancer-cell invasion. Here we describe the studies on the signal-transducing molecules and the target junctional molecules that might be relevant for TJ and AJ disassembly.

### 4.1. Signaling pathways that trigger disassembly of intercellular junctions

Disassembly of TJs and AJs is caused by modifying the junctional components directly or by exerting indirect effects through the actin cytoskeleton which controls the integrity of TJs and AJs. Any of the junctional components, transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins, could be targets to be affected. Well-characterized molecular mechanisms causing disassembly of TJs and AJs are loss-of-function mutations as observed in cadherins and catenins, upregulated activities of proteolytic enzymes that break extracellular or intracellular domain of adhesion proteins, and increased production of cytokines by micro-environment of cancer cells and infectious micro-organisms. TJ disassembly is associated with increased paracellular permeability, decrement of TER, and displacement of ZO-1 and occludin from TJs. Redistribution of E-cadherin and β-catenin from AJs and reduced association of p120-catenin with the E-cadherin-catenin complexes are frequently observed during TJ disassembly. Biochemical changes often found are an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-1 and β-catenin, and a decrease in E-cadherin levels. The affinity for the interaction of β-catenin to E-cadherin is reduced by phosphorylation of β-catenin Y654 that is known as a site of action for activated growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases [64].

E-Cadherin is cleaved at both sides of the transmembrane domain: metalloproteinase cleavage after the human E-cadherin ectodomain residue Pro700, and presenilin-1 (PS-1)/γ-secretase cleavage between residues Leu731 and Arg732 [201]. PS-1 is a protein involved in Alzheimer's disease and controls a γ-secretase-like cleavage of E-cadherin. The PS-1/γ-secretase cleavage dissociates E-cadherins, β-catenin, and α-catenin from the cytoskeleton, thus promoting disassembly of the E-cadherin-catenin adhesion complex. Furthermore, this cleavage releases the cytoplasmic E-cadherin to the cytosol and increases the levels of soluble β-catenin and α-catenin. Thus, the PS-1/γ-secretase system stimulates disassembly of the E-cadherin-catenin complex and increases the cytosolic pool of β-catenin, a key regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway which activates T-cell factor (TCF)/Lef-mediated transcription in response to Wnt growth factors. As ZO-1 can interact with α-catenin, it is conceivable that ZO-1 influences β-catenin signaling. Expression of truncated ZO-1 and manipulation of occludin can cause activation of β-catenin-TCF/Lef-mediated transcription [202]. On the other hand, activation of β-catenin-signaling has been shown to downregulate ZO-1 expression. Epithelial cells are known to cease proliferating when they polarize and form junctions, but it remains to be determined how cellular junctions control or suppress cell proliferation [203]. As both AJ and TJ components have been linked to the suppression of proliferation, β-catenin signaling could inactivate the proliferation suppressive function of TJs. Spatial organization of the Wnt signaling may provide clues to answer the question.

Chelating Ca²⁺ from the culture medium, under EGTA treatment, breaks homophilic interaction of E-cadherin, and causes disruption of AJs and TJs. During the opening of intercellular junctions, ZO-1 colocalizes with E-cadherin in the lateral membrane region, whereas ZO-1 normally colocalizes with occludin and claudin-1 in TJs. Disruption of TJs is
correlated with a loss of both occludin and JAMs, but not ZO-1, in the reassembling TJ structure [204]. The nectin-based cell–cell adhesions, however, are not disrupted by transient calcium depletion in MDCK cells. Restoration of Ca²⁺ in the medium causes re-accumulation of E-cadherin to the residual nectin-based cell–cell adhesion sites to re-form AJs.

The nectin–afadin system is apparently involved in the SF/HGF- and a tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced disruption of the E-cadherin-based cell–cell adhesion. SF/HGF and TPA have been shown to induce proteolytic cleavage of nectin-1α in the ectodomain, resulting in the generation of the 80-kD extracellular fragment and the 33-kD fragment composed of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains [205,206]. Nectin-1α serves as a substrate for PS-1/γ-secretase [205] and this shedding of nectin-1α is inhibited by metalloprotease inhibitors. The TPA-induced and SF/HGF-induced ectodomain shedding of nectin-1α causes the disruption of the nectin-based cell–cell adhesion, which may trigger the disruption of the E-cadherin-based cell–cell adhesion and the subsequent intercellular dissociation. Alternatively, the ectodomain shedding of nectin-1α may somehow transduce signals. The 80-kD extracellular fragment of nectin-1α, which is released into the culture medium, may *trans*-interact with nectin-1 or nectin-3 on the cell surface and induce cell spreading and scattering through the activation of Cdc42 and Rac. The 33-kD fragment, composed of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, which is anchored to the plasma membrane, may also transduce intracellular signals as suggested for PECAM-1 [207].

Signaling to TJs and AJs during disassembly of junctional complexes involves many signal transducers, including G proteins (Rho, Rac, Cdc42, Ras, and ARF6) and protein kinases (PKC, PKA, and c-Src). Several studies indicate that TJs and AJs are controlled by distinct signaling pathways. HGF and v-Src have been shown to activate endogenous ARF6. The GTP-ARF6-induced AJ disassembly is dependent on the internalization of E-cadherin into the cytoplasm. ARF6 activation results in internalization of E-cadherin, and a loss of AJs and ruffling of the lateral plasma membrane, but does not perturb TJ assembly or cell polarity [208]. GTP-ARF6 interacts with and recruits Nm23-H1, a nucleoside diphosphate kinase that provides a source of

GTP for dynamin-dependent fission of coated vesicles during endocytosis and down-regulates activation of Rac1 [209]. Thrombin- and histamine-induced disassembly of TJs and AJs are mediated by Rho, antagonized by Rac1, but not affected by Cdc42 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) [176]. RhoA signaling specifically protects TJs from damage during ATP depletion, whereas AJs are specifically protected by Rac1 signaling [210]. Rho-effector kinases (ROCKs) regulate the integrity of both TJs and AJs [211], but the molecular links between ROCK and TJs might differ between endothelial and epithelial cells. In epithelial cells, the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 increases permeability [212], whereas it decreases permeability in endothelial cells [213]. Activated ROCK stimulates disruption of the E-cadherin-based AJs in epithelial cells by stimulating actomyosin contractility [214]. Furthermore, in epithelial sheets, inhibition of ROCK disrupts an apical actomyosin filament network that is believed to be important for epithelial stratification [215]. TGF-β stimulation of the proximal tubular cell line HK-2 cells leads to loss of cell–cell contact and disassembly of both AJ and TJ complexes, and dissociation of the E-cadherin and catenin complexes. These effects of TGF-β are abrogated by a ROCK inhibitor. Both dominant-active V12Ras and HGF/SF induce loss of E-cadherin and β-catenin from intercellular junctions in MDCK cells, and the HGF/SF response is blocked by dominant-negative N17Ras. Desmosomes and TJs are regulated separately from AJs, because they are not disrupted by V12Ras. MAP kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), and Rac1 are downstream effectors of Ras, because loss of AJs is blocked by the kinase inhibitors PD098059 and LY294002 or by dominant-inhibitory mutants of MAP kinase kinase 1 or Rac1. All of these inhibitors also prevent the HGF/SF-induced cell scattering. Thus, the activation of both MAP kinase and PI3-kinase by Ras is required for AJ disassembly [216].

SF/HGF causes increased tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin and a marked reduction of ZO-1 at the lateral sites of MDCK cells during the Ca²⁺ switch [217]. Oxidative stress-induced disruption of TJs is mediated by the activation of c-Src, since the kinase-inactive c-Src delays the disruption of TJs and accelerates Ca²⁺-induced assembly of TJs in Caco-2 cells. v-Src expressed in Caco-2 cells induces β-
catenin and p120-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation, redistribution of E-cadherin to the cytosol and disassembly of AJs. However, TJs of Caco-2 cells are not altered by expression of v-Src. Similar results are obtained with the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate that disrupts AJs, but TJs remain unaltered [218]. Thus, protein tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO proteins and catenins is involved in TJ and AJ disassembly.

### 4.2. Physiological and pathological implications of disrupted TJs

Bacteria and viruses interact with epithelial cells and make use of the host-cell function. Pathogens have evolved strategies to translocate across the barrier of TJs, disrupting the target-cell or tissue structure. Thus, their strategies often dictate the mechanisms of TJ assembly and epithelial polarity. The CAMs occasionally interact with the viral proteins and allow viral attachment and entry into the cell. Nectins are such molecules that serve as receptors for HSV entry and intercellular spread. HSV entry requires the interaction of the envelope gD with nectin-1 (also named HveC) or HveA/HVEM. Nectin-1 and gD colocalize at cell contact areas between infected and uninfected cells and at the edges of plaques. gD is proposed to attract and maintain the receptor at cellular junctions through which HSV can spread to another cell [219]. Since nectin-1α is located in the normal human epidermis, follicles and eccrine ducts, soluble forms of gD are able to prevent nectin-1-mediated cell aggregation and to disrupt cell clumps in an affinity-dependent manner. HSV also prevents nectin-1-mediated cell aggregation by occupying the receptor. In the early stage of infection, nectin-1 is not downregulated from the cell surface, but protein levels of nectin-1 gradually change over a 30-min period of infection, as reflected by a decrease in the CK41 epitope and an increase in the CK35 epitope. Thus, the nectin-1 and gD complex on the cell surface may undergo conformational changes during HSV entry as part of an evolving interaction between the viral envelope and the cell plasma membrane [220].

Many pathogens disrupt TJs during infection in a variety of mechanisms [221]. Some bacterial toxins modify small G proteins, leading to disruption of TJs. The diarrheagenic pathogen *Clostridium difficile* produces toxins that inactivate RhoA by glucosylation. This causes F-actin reorganization, dissociation of actin from ZO-1, dissociation of occludin, ZO-1 and ZO-2 from the TJs, and a decrease in TER of epithelial monolayers. Enteropathogenic *E. coli* (EPEC) also targets TJs through manipulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Decreases in TER during EPEC infection can be correlated with myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, ezrin phosphorylation, occludin dephosphorylation, and occludin and ZO-1 dissociation from TJs. Ezrin, a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family of proteins that mediate membrane and actin-cytoskeletal linkages, controls the localization of certain apical membrane proteins, and phosphorylation of ezrin increases its cytoskeletal association. EPEC's use of ezrin to disrupt TJs may involve signaling through Rho, because ezrin has been implicated in signaling both upstream and downstream of Rho. In *Drosophila*, moesin, another ERM protein, has been demonstrated to control epithelial polarity and integrity through antagonistic effects on Rho signaling [222]. The bacterial protein implicated in TJ disassembly is EspF that is required in a dose-dependent manner for the decrease in TER and occludin redistribution seen during EPEC infection [223], and ezrin activation is attenuated in an EPEC strain lacking EspF [224]. EspF contains proline-rich domains that resemble SH3-binding or tryptophan-tryptophan-binding domains, suggesting that it interacts with one or more host-cell proteins via these domains. No binding partners have yet been described for EspF.

Zonula occludens toxin (Zot) derived from *Vibrio cholerae* interacts with a specific intestinal epithelial surface receptor, with subsequent activation of a complex intracellular cascade of events that regulate TJ permeability. Zot localizes in the bacterial outer membrane with subsequent cleavage and secretion of a C-terminal fragment in the host intestinal milieu. This toxin mimics the effect of a related endogenous modulator of intestinal TJs. The mammalian zot analogue, zonulin, is identified to induce TJ disassembly in non-human primate intestinal epithelia. Micro-organisms induce zonulin secretion and increase small-intestinal permeability [225]. Amino acid comparison between the Zot active fragment and zonulin confirms the presence of an octapeptide receptor-binding domain toward the N-terminus of
the processed Zot. Zonulin expression is raised in intestinal tissues during the acute phase of coeliac disease, a clinical condition in which TJs are opened and epithelial barrier permeability is increased [226]. This zonulin-driven opening of the paracellular pathway may represent a defensive mechanism, which flushes out micro-organisms and contributes to the host response against bacterial colonization of the small intestine [227]. Zonulin, a modulator of small-intestinal TJs, causes TJ disassembly associated with the disengagement of ZO-1 from the TJs and a decrease in TER of small-intestinal epithelium on the luminal aspect of the bacteria-exposed small-intestinal mucosa [228].

It is largely unknown how and when TJs are regulated during developmental and physiological processes, including tissue morphogenesis and cell migration. However, TJs and AJs are likely to be dynamically regulated in order to respond to a variety of signals. For example, during spermatogenesis, inter-Sertoli TJs that create the blood–testis barrier in the rat must be disassembled and reassembled to permit the timely passage of preleptotene spermatocytes from the basal to the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium. These events are composed of intermittent phases of junction disassembly and reassembly. TGF-β signaling is reported to play a crucial role in regulating the complicated biochemical events of TJ assembly in the testis by using in vitro model of CdCl₂-induced inter-Sertoli TJ disassembly and reassembly [229,230]. Mice lacking Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI)-α show the disruption of renal tubular epithelial cells and the dilatation of renal tubules, as well as impaired spermatogenesis with the disruption of epithelia of seminiferous tubules in the testis [231]. These changes deteriorated in age-dependent manner. Since Rho GDI downregulates the activities of RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, activated Rho family signaling can result in disassembly of TJs and AJs in the kidneys and testes of Rho GDI-α knocked-out mice.

### 4.3. Cancer-cell invasion and metastasis

Disruption of intercellular junctions and epithelial polarity can cause epithelial cells to proliferate wildly, leading to a multilayered architecture and potentially, cancer. Most human tumors gradually lose their epithelial character in a process termed the epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Indeed, some 90% of fatal malignancies in adult humans arise from epithelial cells. Since nearly 40% of human tumors have activating mutations in one of the three Ras genes, Ras may regulate intercellular junction formation in epithelial cells, and conversely intercellular junction proteins themselves may play a role in regulating Ras activation and signaling [232]. When comparing the structural patterns of TJs in normal human colon mucosa with those of colon adenocarcinomas by the freeze-fracture technique, the well-differentiated adenocarcinoma cells in the luminal region retain their polarity and have seven or eight parallel junctional elements, whereas TJs of infiltrating cells appear as fascia occludens and resemble the premature junctional organization of 10-week fetuses [233].

In multicellular organisms, cell adhesion and migration are critical for many events, including tissue patterning, morphogenesis, and the maintenance of normal tissue architecture [55,61,234]. Adhesion and migration of normal cells are dynamic and well-regulated events [55,234]. Cells disrupt cell–cell adhesion and start to migrate in response to extracellular cues, such as growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix molecules [67,235]. Cell migration is divided into at least four mechanistically separate steps: formation of protrusions, formation of new adhesions, contraction of cell body, and tail detachment. The extracellular cues stimulate cell surface receptors to initiate intracellular signaling through second messengers, protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and heterotrimeric large and monomeric small G proteins to regulate these multiple steps. The driving force for cell movement is normally provided by dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is regulated by the Rho-family G proteins: the activity of Cdc42 is required for cell polarity (at least in yeast, T cells, macrophages, and astrocytes); Rac controls the formation of lamellipodia and also the turnover of focal complexes, together with Cdc42; and Rho regulates the generation of actomyosin contraction at the rear of cells to draw the cell body forwards.

Transformation of cells causes disruption of cell–cell adhesion, increased cell motility, and loss of contact inhibition of cell movement and proliferation, eventually leading transformed cells to uncontrolled
cell proliferation, invasion into surrounding tissues, and finally metastasis to other organs [235, 236]. However, molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological or pathological processes are not fully understood. Transformation of normal cells by expression of oncogenes or stimulation of normal cells by growth factors induce disruption of intercellular junctions, followed by cell migration [67]. In cultured epithelial cells, for instance, SF/HGF and TPA induce cell spreading, followed by disruption of cell–cell adhesion, subsequent intercellular dissociation, and ultimately cell scattering [237–239]. Regulation of the cell–cell adhesion activity of E-cadherin has been shown to play a crucial role in rapid change in cell–cell adhesion and several different mechanisms have been proposed for this regulation: they include changes in the composition of the E-cadherin–catenin complex, interaction of α-catenin with the actin cytoskeleton, tyrosine phosphorylation of the E-cadherin–catenin complexes, association of E-cadherin with p120 catenin, endocytosis of E-cadherin, proteolytic processing of E-cadherin, and regulation by Rac, Cdc42, and Rho [67]. Mutations of the components of the cadherin–catenin system have been reported in some carcinomas of highly invasive and metastatic nature [240–242]. However, in the carcinomas of which the cadherin–catenin system is intact, the causative gene mutations responsible for their highly invasive and metastatic nature have not yet been elucidated. The components of the nectin–afadin system can also be mutated or downregulated during tumorigenesis. The concentration of the nectin–afadin system at intercellular AJs is reduced in the early stage of malignant transformation of keratinocytes, such as in basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, where the cadherin–catenin system was preserved. Reduction of nectin-1α at intercellular AJs may be involved in the invasion of squamous cell tumors [243].

When migrating cells contact other cells, they stop migration and proliferation and adhere to each other to become confluent [244–247]. This phenomenon has been known for a long time as contact inhibition of cell movement and proliferation. The mutation in the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene encoding merlin, a member of the ERM family proteins, results in aggressive tumor of the nervous system. Cultured fibroblast cells derived from mice lacking NF2

(merlin-deficient) do not stop proliferating when the cells contact each other. The merlin-deficient cells are also unable to establish cell–cell contacts through AJs, assemblies known to mediate the contact-dependent arrest of cell growth [248]. Like other members (ezrin, radixin, moesin), the tumor suppressor merlin resides at the interface between the cell membrane and actin cytoskeleton, and has been reported to interact with a number of protein partners and to inhibit many signaling pathways when overexpressed [249].

## 5. Role of TJs in permeability between body compartments

TJs serve as fences to the diffusion of some membrane proteins and lipids between the apical and basolateral domains of the plasma membrane. If TJs are disrupted, for example, by removing the extracellular Ca²⁺, mixing of such proteins and lipids will occur. On the other hand, TJs seal neighboring cells together and create selective permeability barriers along the paracellular pathway [250, 251]. If a low-molecular-weight tracer is added to one side of an epithelium, it will generally not pass beyond TJs. However, these barriers are not absolute. Their permeability to small molecules varies greatly in different epithelia, although TJs are almost impermeable to macromolecules. Similarly, endothelial cells are linked to each other through intercellular junctional complexes that regulate the barrier and fence function of the vascular wall. However, the barrier function of the endothelium appears not so “tight” as the epithelium. Epithelial cells of the skin, the alimentary tract, the respiratory tract, and the urinary tract are all exposed to the outer environment, whereas endothelial cells of blood vessels are within a closed compartment of the body. The endothelium dynamically regulates the extravasation of hormones, macromolecules and other solutes compared to the epithelium. Furthermore, the endothelium regulates migration of leukocytes and metastatic cancer cells. The property of endothelial intercellular junctions varies with the need for permeability. While the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is maintained by tight contacts between endothelial cells, the contacts are generally leaky in microvessels where lymphocytes continuously exit the bloodstream. Although the

precise molecular mechanisms that define the type of junction remain to be characterized, several studies provide a significant advance toward an understanding of roles for TJs.

### 5.1. Transcellular and paracellular transport pathways

The transcellular passage of small molecules across the lipid bilayer is facilitated by transport proteins that involve the active uptake of substances at the free surface by pinocytosis, followed by transport of the vesicles across the cell and release of their content at the cell base. The role of transcellular transport has been extensively studied, but the importance of paracellular transport has not been thoroughly investigated. The paracellular movement is restricted by TJs that appear as complex meshlike strands and consist primarily of the membrane protein claudins [9,252]. The TJs are determinants of closing the paracellular pathway and enabling the cells to exercise selectivity as to what passes across the epithelium [29,30,253–255]. How the paracellular barrier is both maintained and regulated will be of interest.

Epithelial cells can transiently alter their TJs to permit an increased flow of solutes and water through pores in the junctional barriers (Fig. 10). Such paracellular transport is especially important in the absorption of amino acids and monosaccharides from the lumen of the intestine. Without TJs to prevent leakage, the pumping activities of absorptive cells such as those in the intestine would be useless, and the composition of the medium on the two sides of the epithelium would become uniform. In contrast, some types of epithelia that transport large amounts of fluid and electrolytes, such as the proximal renal tubule, is characterized as having highly permeable intercellular TJs. Because the proximal tubule epithelium has “leaky” TJs, fluid and solutes can cross this nephron segment not only transcellularly but also through the paracellular pathway. Because the TJ surface area in the proximal tubule is limited, the TJ must contain large or many pores to give a sufficiently high paracellular osmotic permeability to contribute to proximal tubule transport. At least 50% of the total transepithelial water flow occurs through the paracellular pathway in the proximal tubule [256].

Endothelial cells can transiently alter their TJs to permit transendothelial migration of circulating neutrophils, or leukocyte diapedesis, which is completed within 90 s after a leukocyte arrests on the endothelial surface. Unlike the case for the initial adhesive interactions (rolling and adhesion), about which there is a general consensus on the mechanisms involved, little is known regarding the mechanisms involved in leukocyte transendothelial migration. The studies, however, support that leukocytes emigrate between endothelial cells (paracellular pathway), as well as through the endothelial cells proper (transcellular pathway) [257]. Two populations of leukocytes are captured adhering to endothelial cell monolayers: those underneath which there is disruption of the AJ proteins, and those underneath which there is no disruption of the continuity of the AJ proteins. Adhesion and transendothelial migration of leukocytes can result in local disruption of the AJ proteins [258]. AJ proteins beneath adherent leukocytes are sequentially affected; β-catenin is lost before vascular-endothelial (VE)-cadherin. With respect to the TJ complexes, leukocyte transendothelial migration disrupts ZO-1 and ZO-2 continuity only at the site of leukocyte penetration into the interendothelial junctions [259]. Alternatively, the majority of leukocytes appear to exit the vasculature transcellularly during emigration in vivo, through pores or passages that traverse the endothelial cytoplasm. The endothelium often appears to spread along the luminal side of the leukocyte surface to completely engulf it, thereby closing the luminal gap before the leukocyte is released into the tissue matrix [260–262]. The endothelium remains undamaged and continues to form caveolae and endocytic vesicles even in membrane regions that are in close contact with the leukocyte. Therefore, leukocytes can use both paracellular and transcellular pathways to traverse the endothelial barrier during inflammation. Diapedesis tends to occur preferentially at tricellular corners rather than between two endothelial cells, indicating that AJs and TJs are discontinuous at these tricellular corners, thus presenting the passage of least resistance for the transmigrating leukocyte. The leukocyte can preferentially use pores in the thin region of the endothelial cells, such as fenestrae or caveolae, as the passage of least resistance [257]. It remains largely unknown, however, how the endothelial cell changes

(A) Two pathways for transepithelial fluid and solute movement between the epithelial lumen and the interstitium. The flows through the paracellular pathway have been estimated to be less than 2% for intestines and about 50% for proximal renal tubules compared with the transcellular pathway. (B) Schematic representation of paracellular diapedesis (upper panel) and transcellular diapedesis (lower panel). Paracellular diapedesis through endothelial intercellular junctions involves disassembly of endothelial nectin–afadin complexes (green bars) and VE-cadherin–β-catenin complexes (red bars). Disassembly is promoted by either proteolytic cleavage of adhesion molecules or intracellular signaling initiated by cell–cell contact (red circles). Transcellular diapedesis is a process by which neutrophils adheres endothelial cells and inserts filopodia-like processes into endothelial caveolae or vesiculo-vacuolar organelles. The endothelial cells engulf the luminal portion of the neutrophils and reseal the blood vessel before the neutrophils migrate into the tissue. PMN; polymorphonuclear leukocyte.

### 5.2. TJ proteins in endothelial cells

Experiments with cultured epithelial cells have demonstrated that occludin regulates size-selective paracellular diffusion of hydrophilic molecules [263]. Therefore, it is likely that occludin regulates paracellular permeability in endothelial cells as well. It has

been proposed that phosphorylation of the regulatory C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of occludin regulates paracellular permeability of endothelia [264]. JAM-1 and JAM-2 have also been shown to differentially regulate paracellular permeability, suggesting that the presence of JAM-1, JAM-2, or JAM-3 in vascular junctions may play a role in regulating vascular function in vivo [265]. Among claudins, claudin-5 and claudin-12 are located at TJs in brain endothelial cells. Notably, claudin-5 is a critical determinant of

BBB permeability in mice [266]. Brain capillaries generally allow little nonspecific transendothelial transport since they exhibit only very low rates of fluid movement by transcytosis, and the paracellular pathway between individual brain endothelial cells is sealed by TJs much tighter than in peripheral microvessels. Mice lacking claudin-5 do not show a general disassembly of TJs in brain endothelial cells, but show a selective increase in paracellular permeability of small molecules. Namely, the absence of claudin-5 alters the junctional properties so that they function like a molecular sieve, allowing tracer diffusion in a size-selective manner (lower than under 800 Da), but it does not cause nonspecific leakage of larger plasma components into the brain. The absolute amount of available claudin proteins may not be a critical determinant of junction biogenesis, because removal or addition of claudins generally does not affect the permeability properties of TJs. Claudins have mainly been related to selective ion permeability as observed in the human mutation study of claudin-16/paracellin-1 [30]. Therefore, it is conceivable that claudins form paracellular pores or channels that mediate selective ion permeability [4]. Now that the BBB can be manipulated to allow selective diffusion of small molecules, it might be possible to remove or inactivate claudin-5 temporarily for permitting drugs to be delivered across the BBB. In addition to claudin-5, occludin can be manipulated through disruption by *Clostridium perfringens* enterotoxin [267]. Intracellular signaling components that regulate paracellular diffusion, such as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1 that can be affected by a recently identified TJ-associated activator of RhoA [268], have also been proposed as an target for this purpose [269].

AJs of endothelial cells consist of VE-cadherin/catenin complexes. VE-Cadherin has an extracellular domain that homotypically interacts with VE-cadherin on adjacent endothelial cells. The cytoplasmic domain of VE-cadherin associates with intracellular β-catenin or γ-catenin. These VE-cadherin–catenin complexes are connected to the actin cytoskeleton via α-catenin. When β-catenin is conditionally inactivated in endothelial cells using the Cre/loxP system, the absence of β-catenin significantly reduces the capacity of endothelial cells to maintain cell–cell contacts, leading to fluid leakage or hemorrhages at bifurcations or in the beating heart when the vessels

are exposed to high or turbulent flow [270]. Although general vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are not affected, the hemorrhagic vessels and fluid extravasation in the pericardial cavity observed in mutant mice, as well as the marked changes in the actin cytoskeleton in β-catenin-deficient endothelial cells parallel a decrease in cell–cell adhesion strength and an increase in paracellular permeability. Nectins, Necls, and afadin are constituents of the AJs of the endothelial cells, but the roles for paracellular permeability have not been thoroughly investigated.

### 5.3. Regulation of vascular permeability

Microvascular permeability is mediated by the caveolar transcytosis of molecules across endothelial cells and by the paracellular movement of ions and nutrients. Caveolin plays a dual regulatory role in controlling microvascular permeability, as a structural protein that is required for caveolae formation and caveolar transcytosis. Caveolin could constitute a key switch in tumor development through its function as a tumor suppressor and as a promoter of metastasis, chemoresistance, and survival. Mice lacking caveolin-1 showing defects in caveolae-mediated endocytosis are compensated by an increase in the paracellular pathway, resulting in increased microvascular permeability. Caveolin-1-deficient lung capillaries reveal defects in TJ morphology and abnormalities in capillary endothelial cell adhesion to the basement membrane [271]. Disruption of TJs leads to increased permeability, and in endothelial cells this is usually induced by vasoactive agents, such as thrombin or bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and by cytokines. Vasoactive agents induce tiny leakage sites between the cells, and cytokines, in particular vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF), which increase the exchange of plasma proteins by vesicles and intracellular pores as well as by TJ disassembly. VPF/VEGF, the critical molecule in tumor angiogenesis, is regulated by hypoxia, oncogenes, and growth factors. PKC-ζ plays a central role in VPF/VEGF expression and acts as a switching element. VPF/VEGF functions primarily by activating two receptor tyrosine kinases, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2), both of which are selectively expressed on the primary vascular endothelium [272]. Exposure to hypoxia causes

structural changes in the endothelial cell layer that alter its permeability and its interaction with leukocytes and platelets. The hypoxia-induced actin redistribution appears to be mediated by components downstream of MAPK p38, which is activated in pulmonary endothelial cells in response to hypoxia. VEGF increases endothelial monolayer permeability by reducing occludin expression, and by disrupting ZO-1 and occludin organization, which leads to TJ disassembly. Therefore, occludin and ZO-1 appear to be downstream effectors of the VEGF signaling pathway [273]. The combined treatment of TNF-α plus IFN-γ is reported to cause redistribution of JAM, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 (CD31), an transmembrane protein with an essential role in transendothelial migration, and VE-cadherin away from lateral junctions of human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers. JAMs change their distribution in response to proinflammatory cytokines [274] but per se do not negatively regulate either neutrophil or monocyte transmigration under flow [275]. This redistribution of JAMs might be involved in a decrease in transendothelial migration of leukocytes at inflammatory sites. Culture of HUVECs with TNF-α plus IFN-γ causes a decrease in surface-expressed and junctional-localized JAMs and PECAM-1, but does not cause decreased leukocyte transmigration in an in vitro flow assay. Tumor vasculature is well known to be hyperpermeable to macromolecules compared to normal vasculature; however, the relationship of tumor hyperpermeability with TJ disassembly and with tumor progression is poorly understood.

The actin cytoskeleton is likely to regulate paracellular flux by altering the tension applied to the membrane associated junctional complex. TJ proteins such as ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, and cingulin, and p130 are phosphoproteins, leading to speculation that these proteins may be targeted by kinases or phosphatases associated with many intracellular messenger cascades. Changes in the phosphorylation state of these components of the TJ multiprotein complex could induce conformational changes in occludin, claudins, and JAMs, and alter the permeability of the TJs. A canine GEF of the Dbl family, also known as human GEF-H1 and mouse Lfc, has been shown to activate Rho and associates with TJs [268]. GEF-H1/Lfc regulates paracellular permeability of small hydrophilic tracers in MDCK cells, although such cell lines exhibit a normal overall morphology and form fully assembled TJs. It is conceivable that GEF-H1/Lfc or related GEF serves as a component of TJs and functions in the regulation of size-selective paracellular permeability in epithelial cells as well as in endothelial cells. Since endothelial permeability is readily inhibited by dominant-negative ROCKs constructs or by ROCKs inhibitor Y27632 [213], Rho and ROCKs activation leads to loss of TJ integrity and an increase in paracellular permeability. Rho and ROCKs have a pivotal role in monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1-induced junction disarrangement and increased brain endothelial permeability [276]. MCP-1 induces stress fiber formation and redistribution of TJ proteins, ZO-1, ZO-2, occludin, and claudin-5, and is associated with an increase in permeability in brain endothelial cells. The ROCKs inhibitor Y27632 and inhibition of Rho, by C3 exoenzyme and dominant negative RhoT19N, prevent MCP-1-induced stress fiber assembly, reorganization of TJ proteins and alterations in endothelial permeability.

Signaling in microvascular permeability regulates the interaction between VE-cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton. Rho family activities and protein tyrosine phosphorylation are thought to be two major molecular switches that control cytoskeletal dynamics and VE-cadherin function in endothelial cells. Studies using cultured endothelial monolayers indicate that Rho family proteins are involved in the modulation of endothelial monolayer permeability by regulating the assembly of the cellular actin filament scaffold, the activity of myosin-based contractility, and the junctional distribution of VE-cadherin. PKC-α appears to be critical in regulating Rho GDI phosphorylation, Rho activation, and in signaling Rho-dependent endothelial barrier dysfunction [277]. The vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP), an endothelial receptor-type phosphatase, is one of the transmembrane binding partners of VE-cadherin that associates through an extracellular domain and reduces the tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and cell layer permeability [278]. Thrombospondin-1 can modulate endothelial barrier function through tyrosine phosphorylation of endothelial cell proteins such as focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, γ-catenin, and p120 (Cas) [279]. It would be an oversimplification to conclude that the paracellular transport of the endo-
thelium depends solely on the functions of the actin cytoskelton underlining TJs and AJs. However, further studies on the regulatory pathways that link the Rho family activities to the TJ and AJ integrity will provide valuable insights into the understanding of endothelial permeability.

# 6. Conclusions

TJs and AJs are intercellular connections that provide epithelial cells or endothelial cells with an amazing ability to change their shape and polarity, and to regulate transcription and cell proliferation. It is a prerequisite for development and differentiation that cells can move through tissues with intricate precision. Nectin-based cell–cell adhesions have functional roles in the morphogenetic and patterning processes in tissues, both independently and cooperatively with the claudin-based TJs and the cadherin-based AJs. Nectins and Necls play a key part in identifying cell partners by forming homophilic and heterophilic trans-dimers in the primordial cell–cell adhesion. Diversity is another important aspect of TJs and AJs. The transmembrane proteins of TJs, claudins and JAMs, form a family consisting of several members. It is also the case with cadherins and nectins of AJs. Such a complexity is further augmented by the binding of the specific cytoplasmic proteins. ZO proteins form a family of three members, and can move from TJs to other membrane domains to find binding partners. Two isoforms of afadin can bind directly or indirectly to many cytoplasmic proteins through multidomains. Catenins, consisting of four members, can exchange their binding partners. Thus, the total possible combinations of such interactions are countless. Epithelial cells and endothelial cells form various kinds of TJs in order to fulfill the need of each tissue. Knock-out studies often demonstrate that mice manage to compensate for a deficiency of TJ or AJ proteins. These facts can be explained by the molecular complexity of TJ and AJ proteins.

The actin cytoskelton is essential for coordinated cell movement and behavior, and appears to be at the nexus of structural and functional regulation of TJ integrity and cell polarity. Structural proteins of TJs and AJs, as well as many signaling molecules such as the Rho family G proteins, interact with the actin cytoskelton. Furthermore, ZO-1, β-catenin, and afadin act not only as structural components but also as signaling transducers involved in gene expression and cell proliferation. Disruption of this intricate molecular mechanism may cause cells to proliferate; thus, allowing cancer cells to escape from the epithelium. We are beginning to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in cell polarity in mammals. However, since the emerging studies are mainly based on genetics in *Drosophila* and *C. elegans*, they still lack complete biochemical evidence, and much remains to be done to understand how external signals, initiated by spatial cue of cell–cell adhesion in epithelial cells, are transmitted through TJs and AJs to the actin cytoskeleton in order to communicate this information to other critical systems within the cell. The studies we provide here on candidates that might regulate TJ assembly and cell polarity is by no means comprehensive. However, it may contribute to understanding how the components of the junctional complexes, and the multitude of proteins that are associated with them, participate in the establishment and the maintenance of epithelial and endothelial cells.
