### Abstract

Defects in the APC gene are inarguably linked to the progression of colon cancers that arise both sporadically and through the transmission of germline mutations. Genetic evidence from humans and mouse models suggest that APC is a classic tumor suppressor in that both alleles likely require inactivation for tumor growth to ensue. Nearly all of the mutations, germline and somatic, result in premature termination of the single polypeptide chain, normally consisting of 2843 amino acids. Several definable motifs have now been mapped to the linear amino acid sequence of the APC polypeptide. These include an oligomerization domain, armadillo repeats, binding sites for β-catenin, the human discs large protein, microtubules, and other proteins of unknown function. Inactivation of APC in cancer is likely due to loss of function(s) normally associated with the deleted protein structure.

### 1. Introduction

Germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are responsible for an inherited form of colon cancer known as familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP) [1, 2]. FAP individuals develop hundreds to thousands of polyps in the large intestine at an early age of which a subset invariably progress to malignant cancers if not surgically removed [3]. APC gene defects are also highly prevalent in sporadic tumors of the colon and appear early in the multigenetic course of cancer progression [4, 5]. Although cancer of the large intestine is the hallmark manifestation of FAP, patients also present tumors in other regions of the gastrointestinal tract, and in the brain, thyroid, abdominal cavity, and elsewhere [6]. The role of APC gene defects in sporadic cancers other than those in colon is less clear. In some cases APC defects in extracolonic tumors have been implied from loss of heterozygosity in the region of the APC locus [7, 8], but it was unclear whether an additional tumor suppressor, proximal to the APC locus, was also deleted in these cases.

Literally hundreds of APC mutations have been identified in germline cells of FAP individuals and in tumor tissue resected from cancer patients [9, 10]. The vast majority of these mutations result in the truncation of the APC gene product. The somatic mutations are clustered in the central region of the open reading frame while the germline mutations, although not clustered, are confined to the 5' half of the APC coding sequence (Fig. 1). Consequently, defective APC gene products that are typically observed in tumors and cancer cell lines have molecular sizes roughly half that of wildtype APC protein [11–13]. The nature and positions of the APC mutations suggest that specific structure needs to be eliminated in order for tumor progression to proceed. As would be expected from a polypeptide of over 2800 amino acids, numerous domains, motifs and other signatures

tifs are also apparent from the comparison of human APC amino acid sequence to that of *Drosophila* APC [22].

An issue central to understanding APC function is the determination of which cellular processes become deregulated as result of its inactivation. This lost suppressor activity likely relates to proteins that bind to those regions of APC deleted in cancers. Among those features of APC that are generally ablated by mutation are the human discs large protein binding site, the microtubule interaction domain, the EB1 binding site, and several of the seven repeated sequences of 20 amino acids each contained in the central region of the protein (Fig. 1). The remaining mutant APC proteins typically retain binding sites for β-catenin [12,16] and are capable of oligomerizing with wildtype APC or a second mutant APC protein [13]. This raises the possibility of an interfering function that might result from the expression of an aberrant APC gene product. Although this model is inconsistent with the formation of intestinal adenomas, as both alleles of APC are frequently inactivated [4,5,23], certain extracolonic manifestations of the FAP syndrome do correlate well with the position of the APC germline mutation [24–28]. There is also evidence that the site of the APC mutation may correlate with the severity of cancer in FAP [29–32].

It is clear that loss of APC function results in tumor formation, but it is not apparent how this translates to a cellular phenotype that can be observed in vitro. Loss of APC could positively effect the steady state cell count in the intestine by altering cell cycle parameters, slowing cell migration, altering cell adhesion, or preventing programmed cell death. All of these possibilities have been proposed as roles for the APC tumor suppressor in vivo. In this review, I summarize the genetic analysis of APC inactivation and its potential for cooperation with other gene defects. The mutational spectrum of APC is presented as framework for discussing the consequences of these mutations with respect to the APC protein and the various domains that have been mapped to its amino acid sequence. Particular emphasis is placed on proteins that interact with these domains and how their functions might relate to the proposed roles for APC. Cell biology experiments, designed to investigate the function of APC, are reviewed and, finally, the relationship between APC genotype and pheno-

type is discussed with respect to protein structure and function.

## 2. Genetic analysis

### 2.1. Mutational spectrum

The hundreds of mutations in the APC gene that have now been documented provide a clear description of mutation type and position. Previous reviews, one offering a well-documented data base, have covered this area extensively [9,10] providing us with a distinct pattern of mutations that accurately represents the entire spectrum (Fig. 1). Nearly all mutations predict the premature termination of the polypeptide chain. Two-thirds of these mutations are frameshifts with the remaining third being nonsense point mutations. Missense point mutations are extremely rare and it is unclear whether these single amino acid substitutions actually inactivate APC. Ninety-nine percent of the transitions at CpG dinucleotides occur as C to T transitions. Nearly all of these transitions occur at CGA codons, which again underscores the selective pressure to introduce a stop codon in the APC reading frame [9]. Almost all of the APC mutations occur in the 5′ half of the open reading frame with the somatic mutations exhibiting a clustering in a region referred to as the mutation cluster region [5] (Fig. 1). The spectrum of somatic mutations compiled from many tumors from a single FAP patient does not differ from the spectrum of somatic mutations compiled from individual tumors resected from many different patients [23]. This last point demonstrates that genetic background and environment likely do not influence the position of the somatic mutations.

### 2.2. One hit or two?

Many cases of biallelic inactivation of APC have been documented, but for some tumors only a single mutant APC allele has been identified [4,5,23,33]. The failure to see inactivation of both APC alleles in all cases could result from technical inadequacies, but may also indicate that mutation of a single copy is enough to promote tumor growth. However, statistics best support the former explanation. The probability

of detecting an APC mutation in germline cells from  
a diagnosed FAP patient is approximately equal to  
that of detecting a somatic mutation in one of their  
tumors [23]. If we assume all FAP patients have a  
germline mutation, then most, if not all, of their  
tumors contain a somatic mutation. Indeed, examination  
of 100 tumors from a single FAP patient resulted  
in the identification of 75 somatic mutations [23].  
These results indicate that in the vast majority of  
human FAP adenomas both copies of APC are likely  
to be inactivated. In the APC<sup>min</sup> mouse, this argument is even more compelling in that the wildtype  
copy of APC was found deleted from all adenomas  
examined [34–37].

If tumors do result from the inactivation of only a  
single APC allele, one must presume a mechanism  
involving either insufficient levels of the APC gene  
product or a dominant function on the part of the  
mutant APC protein. The latter hypothesis is appealing as the mutant APC proteins hetero-oligomerize  
with the wildtype protein [15], however, a recent  
mouse model argues against this mechanism in intestinal tumor formation. Forced expression of APC  
proteins truncated at either amino acid 716 or 1287 in  
the intestinal epithelium of otherwise wildtype mice  
did not promote intestinal adenoma formation [38].  
High level mutant APC protein expression was verified by immunoblotting of intestinal lysates. These  
results argue against a gain-of-function or dominant  
interfering modes of action for truncated APC proteins in intestinal tumorigenesis. Interestingly, three  
of the transgenic chimeric mice exhibited solid tumors in the intestinal cavity suggesting that high  
levels of truncated APC may have dominant effects  
in extracolonic tissues.

successive mutations in tumor suppressors and oncogenes [39]. APC inactivation is an early event followed by activation of ras and loss of p53 and DCC  
or related genes. Mouse models have been used to  

examine the cooperativity of both oncogenic ras and  
inactivation of p53 with APC mutations in tumor  
formation. In one study the ectopic expression of  
oncogenic ras plus inactivation of p53 resulted in  
unscheduled proliferation of gut epithelial cells but  
did not promote the formation of adenomas [40].  
When this was superimposed on a mutant APC background, the number of tumors were only modestly  
increased above that observed with the mutant APC  
mouse alone. It was suggested that the failure of  
oncogenic ras and p53 inactivation to promote tumorigenesis was due to the continuous process of  
epithelial cell renewal that occurs in the intestine, and  
the failure of the transgenes to be expressed in the  
stem cells of intestinal crypts. Initiation of tumors in  
the intestine of the APC mutant mouse may occur in  
the crypt cells and cooperation between various gene  
defects may have to occur here or, more specifically,  
in a stem cell in order to promote tumors. A second  
study in which APC + /− mice were crossed with  
p53 − /− mice resulted in progeny with no increase  
in intestinal adenoma formation relative to APC  
+ /− controls [41]. Surprisingly, the APC + /−;  
p53 − /− mice were prone to pancreatic neoplasias,  
supporting a role for APC in the genesis of extracolonic cancers.

### 3.2. Mismatch repair deficiency and APC

Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is attributable to germline mutations in  
genes responsible for DNA mismatch repair [42,43].  
Mutations in these mismatch repair genes, which also  
occur in a subset of sporadic colorectal tumors, are  
thought to contribute to the overall frequency of  
replication errors (RER) that ultimately affect genes  
controlling cell growth. An important question is  
whether the APC gene represents a target of mismatch repair deficiency in either HNPCC or in sporadic tumors. Heinnen et al. examined 12 colorectal  
cancer cell lines and reported a negative correlation  
between the presence of wildtype APC and microsatellite instability, a hallmark of mismatch defects [11]. This exclusivity of mutations in APC and  
mismatch repair genes led the authors to propose  
independent pathways to tumor formation, one characterized by microsatellite instability, and another in  
which inactivation of APC was involved. However,

in a much more extensive sampling involving both cell lines and tumor samples, Huang et al. reported an equal propensity for APC mutations in cell lines and tumors with or without microsatellite instability [44]. Moreover, their data indicated that the mismatch repair deficiency contributed to the inactivation of the APC gene. This was evident from the significant excess of frameshift mutations in APC in the RER background relative to the nonRER background. The frameshift mutations were characteristic of those expected from the RER phenotype as 81% occurred in microsatellite repeat sequence, while this was the case for only 37% of the APC frameshifts in the nonRER background. Using a mouse model, Reitmair et al. also concluded that defects in mismatch repair genes contributed to mutations in APC [45]. Mice heterozygous for wildtype APC and carrying a germline defect in a the MSH2 mismatch repair gene developed more and faster growing adenomas than mice carrying only the APC mutation. Additionally, adenomas from the APC + / - mice all exhibited deletion of the wildtype APC allele while the adenomas from APC + / - ; MSH2 - / - mice appeared to inactivate the wildtype APC allele by somatic mutation. Taken together the above studies indicate that APC is a target of the RER phenotype in colon cancer.

### 3.3. APC and gene methylation

Although hypomethylation was originally proposed as a contributing factor in the multistep progression of colorectal cancer [39], more recent evidence has demonstrated this to be a protective effect [37]. APC + / - mice that were heterozygous for DNA methyltransferase and treated with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors were far less prone to the development of adenomas than control APC + / - mice [37]. It was suggested that C to T transitions resulting from methylation of cytosine occurred at a lower frequency in the methyltransferase compromised animals. However, the target of protective effect of methyltransferase inhibition was likely not the wildtype APC allele as this is almost always inactivated through LOH in the polyps of APC - / + mice, and not through point mutation [34–37]. The authors suggested p53 as a possible target since it commonly undergoes C to T transitions, but as noted

above, p53 - / - mice carrying a mutant APC allele are not more prone to polyp formation than APC + / - mice alone. Therefore the suppression of neoplasia by methyltransferase inhibition occurs through an unknown mechanism which either prevents LOH at the wildtype APC locus or prevents polyp formation even though LOH has occurred.

## 4. Protein structure

As nearly all mutations in APC result in the truncation of the protein product, it is relevant to examine the pattern of mutations with respect to loss of specific APC protein structure. In addition, protein structure retained by the mutants may also indicate selection for gain- - of-function or interfering functions. The truncations resulting from the germline mutations appear somewhat randomly arrayed throughout the 5' half of the gene, albeit with a few 'hot spots' localized to specific codons [9,10]. Accordingly, the protein products resulting from these mutations would not exhibit any uniform molecular size and may even, in many cases, be too small to exist as stable products. Naturally occurring APC mutant proteins smaller than \(M_r \sim 80000\) have been difficult to detect [13]. The dispersion of these germline mutations is somewhat uninformative then with respect to telling us what it is about the APC protein that the tumor cell is selecting against or trying to retain. On the hand, the somatic mutations show a distinct clustering in the central region of the APC open reading frame and predict mutant proteins terminating between amino acids 1280 and 1500 (Fig. 1). Thus, mutant proteins retain structure, and perhaps function, ascribed to domains encoded by sequence 5' to the site of the mutation. This mutation cluster region [5] will be used as focal point in the discussion of APC protein domains and their potential relevance to disease.

### 4.1. Oligomerization domain

Protein structure that is typically retained by the mutant protein includes the extreme amino-terminal oligomerization domain. That APC could associate with itself was reported by Su et al. in immunoprecipitation experiments using lymphoblastoid cell lines established from FAP patients [15]. These cells coex-

press wildtype and mutant APC alleles and antibodies specific to carboxy-terminal structure of wildtype APC coimmunoprecipitated the truncated mutant protein. This indicated an association of wildtype and mutant APC proteins through amino-terminal structure. Ectopic expression of a series of APC deletion constructs defined a fragment consisting of the amino-terminal 171 amino acids as sufficient to confer oligomerization with a larger APC fragment produced in vitro. Moreover, elimination of 45 amino acids from the APC amino-terminus was sufficient to ablate oligomerization. The amino-terminal third of the APC protein contains a series of heptad repeats that are characteristic of amino acid sequences predicted to form coiled-coil structures mediating certain protein-protein interactions [46]. Although APC is replete with potential coiled-coil domains, it appears that the first heptad repeat (amino-acids 6–57) is specifically involved in the homo-oligomerization of APC [15]. Other amino-terminal fragments consisting of several heptad repeats did not exhibit oligomerization. This is consistent with a study by Joslyn et al. in which APC sequences were enlisted to provide dimerization of the cI repressor of phage lambda [14]. An APC fragment consisting of the first 55 amino acids scored positive for dimerization in this system and a larger fragment lacking the first 45 amino acids was negative. In this study, the CD spectrum of the APC 55-amino acid fragment indicated it consisted of 98% α-helical structure. Based on these results it is likely that wildtype APC polypeptides exist as oligomers and that mutants form mixed oligomers with wildtype APC protein. It is also possible that the protein products of certain splice variants of APC may be devoid of an oligomerization domain [47].

ily of proteins, the smgGDS guanine nucleotide exchange factor, the PF16 microtubule-associated protein, and the APC protein [1,48–54]. Although disparate activities including nuclear transport, cell adhesion, cell cycle control and microtubule stability have been ascribed to the armadillo-containing proteins, it is generally agreed that the armadillo domain represents a site of protein-protein interaction. An NMR solution structure for a synthetic armadillo domain based on APC sequence suggests a large content of α-helical structure [55].

The armadillo domains in β-catenin are essential for its interaction with APC [56–58], cadherins [56–59], the TCF/LEF transcriptional enhancer proteins [60,61], and fascin [62]. Based on deletional analysis with β-catenin, armadillo motifs may have to function in concert to provide high affinity binding to protein substrates. Amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal halves of β-catenin, containing five and seven armadillo motifs, respectively, failed to bind to APC or cadherin [56,57,63]. Although the APC protein contains armadillo repeats, it is clear that neither wildtype APC, nor fragments containing the armadillo domains, associate directly or indirectly with cadherins [12,57]. The function of the APC armadillo motifs remain elusive, although a potential binding protein is discussed below. The pattern of somatic mutations indicate that the armadillo repeats are typically retained by the mutant APC proteins and therefore cannot independently convey tumor suppressor activity. However, the incidence of congenital hypertrophies of the retina (CHRPEs) in FAP patients correlates positively with the retention of these motifs as predicted from the APC germline mutations [24,25,27,28]. This suggests that the armadillo motifs may confer dominant interference or gain-of-function activity in this setting, thereby promoting CHRPEs.

### 4.2. Armadillo repeats

The APC amino acid sequence contains identity to the Drosophila β-catenin homolog armadillo [1]. This remote but significant identity is confined to the 42 amino acid motif that is repeated 13 times in the central region of the armadillo protein [48]. Varying numbers of the armadillo motif have been identified in a variety of proteins which possess little or no apparent common function. These include the armadillo/β-and γ-catenin proteins, the p120<sup>cas</sup> src kinase substrate, the SRP1/importin/pendulin family

### 4.3. β-catenin binding sites

Initial papers on the binding of β-catenin to APC demonstrated that both the wildtype and truncated mutant APCs associate with β-catenin [12,16]. This indicated an amino-terminal localization for the β-catenin site and that loss of this site was not critical for loss of tumor suppressor activity. Using fusion constructs encoding small pieces of APC protein, Su et al. narrowed the location of the β-catenin binding

site to a sequence of 15 amino acids, repeated three times between APC amino acids 1020–1169 [16]. A small fragment containing only the first of these three motifs independently associated with β-catenin [16], and a dissociation constant of approximately 5 nM was estimated for the binding of β-catenin to APC fragments containing these sites [57]. The sequences of the 15-amino acid binding sites (Fig. 2) represented a unique motif for β-catenin binding as they did not resemble any sequences contained in the cytoplasmic β-catenin binding domain of cadherins [64,65].

### 4.4. 20-amino acid repeat motifs

On identification of the APC gene it was noted that the central region of the predicted protein sequence contained a series of 7 motifs of 20 amino acids each with high identity to each other [66]. The consensus sequence of this repeated motif includes 7 perfectly conserved residues with the signature TPXXXFSXXXSXSSL, as well as several residues exhibiting highly conserved substitutions (Fig. 2). The importance of conservation in the signature consensus sequence is also apparent from the corresponding motif identified in the *Drosophila* homolog of APC [22]. Again, most of the signature amino acids are perfectly conserved, in particular, the prolines and serines. On close inspection, it is apparent that the 20-amino acid motifs share some sequence identity with the β-catenin binding sites of 15 amino acids each, noted in the previous section. Considering the conserved proline as the nexus, there is an absolute requirement for a serine at the +4 position and a tyrosine substitutes for the phenylalanine at +3. The prolines and +4-serines are also conserved in the 15-amino acid β-catenin binding sites in the *Drosophila* sequence [22]. Additional conservation of sequence can also be identified between species and between the 20- and 15-amino acid motifs.

The sequence identities between the 15-amino acid β-catenin binding sites and the 20-amino acid motifs suggests the latter may also bind β-catenin. Although this has not been formally proven using a peptide fragment that contains only this sequence, it has been demonstrated that independent small fragments of APC containing the 20-amino acid motif do associate with β-catenin [57]. It is also clear that APC frag-

ments completely lacking the 15-amino binding sites still bind β-catenin with high affinity, provided they contain at least one of the 20-amino acid motifs. Additionally, the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins contain the conserved SLSSL sequence found in 4 of the seven 20-acid motifs from APC. This SLSSL sequence in cadherin maps to its β-catenin binding site [67,68]. Considering the 20-amino acid motifs as true β-catenin sites, the total number of binding sites in APC could be as high as ten and occupy a stretch of polypeptide covering about one-third of the entire APC sequence. Here the implications for the protein truncation due to somatic mutation are more relevant. The 3′ boundary for APC mutation cluster region corresponds to encoded sequence terminating at approximately amino acid 1500 [5,23]. Therefore, most mutants would lack at least five of the seven 20-amino acid motifs suggesting that this structure is targeted for elimination in tumorigenesis. As discussed below, it is this region of APC that not only binds β-catenin but possesses the capacity to promote its downregulation in cells.

### 4.5. The basic domain

The C-terminal third of the APC protein contains a stretch of approximately 200 amino acids originally referred to as the basic domain [66]. The limits of the basic domain are somewhat arbitrarily defined as amino acids 2200–2400. There is an obviously high content of arginine and lysine residues in this region as well as an abnormally high percentage of prolines. This region of APC contains no significant amino acid identity with other known proteins, but the presence of a basic domain interspersed with proline residues is common for many microtubule-associated proteins such as the MAP and tau proteins [69–71]. It is the C-terminal region of APC that confers microtubule binding observed on transient expression in epithelial cells [18,19] and mediates tubulin polymerization in vitro [19]. Additional deletional analysis of APC demonstrated that a much smaller fragment encompassing amino acids 2225–2560 also exhibited this activity (P. Polakis, S. Munemitsu; unpublished data), suggesting microtubule binding is likely mediated by the basic sequence. The basic domain is almost always deleted by the APC mutations associated with colorectal cancer.

4.6. Human discs large (hdlg) protein binding site

In a two hybrid screen using a C-terminal region of APC as bait, a cDNA encoding the human homolog of the *Drosophila* discs large tumor suppressor protein was recovered [21]. When 72 amino acids were deleted from the extreme C-terminus of the APC fragment, the association with hdlg no longer occurred. Moreover, GST fusion protein containing 72 amino acids derived from the APC C-terminus associated with hdlg and the association was competed out by a 15-amino acid synthetic peptide based on the APC C-terminus. That the hdlg binding site is located at the extreme C-terminus of APC is consistent with the previously defined consensus site, S/TXV, found at the C-termini of both the potassium ion channel and NMDA receptors, both known to bind the PDZ/DHR domain found in discs large protein [72,73]. The C-terminus of the APC protein also contains this binding motif [21].

[78]. The amino acid sequences identified as 4.1 protein binding sites in hdlg are distinct from those that interact with APC [21,77] and therefore a ternary complex with APC, hdlg and the 30 kDa-containing proteins is possible. However, the precise relationship between these proteins is unclear.

In the amino-terminal half of hdlg there are three copies of the PDZ/DHR domain; a repeated 90-amino acid sequence that has been identified in numerous signaling proteins including the post synaptic density protein PSD-95, the tight junction protein ZO-1, serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, syntrophins, nitric oxide synthase, the wingless signaling component disheveled, the Tiam racGTPase exchange factor, and the AF-6 ras-binding protein (reviewed in [79]). It was the DHR/PDZ domain of hdlg that was identified as the binding site for the APC protein [21]. In this report it was shown that both APC and hdlg are concentrated at sites of synaptic density in rat hippocampal neurons and at sites of cell-cell contact in epithelial cells. Although APC is largely considered a colon-specific tumor suppressor, its localization and high concentration in the central nervous system [80] are consistent with its mutation in some brain tumors associated with Turcot syndrome [81,82].

Recently, the hdlg homolog PSD95/SAP90 has been implicated in the clustering of substrates known to interact with the PDZ domain. Cotransfection of shaker-type potassium channels with PSD95/SAP90 resulted in formation of micron-sized clusters of ion channels not seen on transfection of either gene alone [73]. A similar clustering of neurotransmitter receptors may also be mediated by PSD95/SAP90. The NMDA receptor and PSD95 were highly enriched in a post synaptic density fraction from rat brain [83] and the two proteins exhibited colocalization in cultured neurons [72]. The binding of both the potassium channels and NMDA receptors to PSD95 occurred through the interaction of the PDZ/DHR domain with a T/SXV motif located at the extreme C-terminus of both the ion channel and receptor [72,73,84]. An extrapolation of these findings suggests that the PDZ domain-containing proteins may serve as assemblers of protein complexes that are concentrated at sites near the plasma membrane. This may be relevant to the binding of the hdlg protein to APC as the endogenous APC protein has recently

5. Associated proteins

5.1. Human discs large (hdlg) protein

Deletion of particular genes in *Drosophila* can lead to a phenotype resembling tumorigenesis in higher organisms [74]. It was the manifestation of such neoplastic growth and loss of epithelial cell polarity in the imaginal discs of *Drosophila* that led Bryant and colleagues to the identification of the discs large tumor suppressor [75]. The discs large protein localizes to the cytoplasmic surface of the septate junction, a barrier-forming junction found in the epithelial cells of invertebrates [76]. Subsequently a human homolog of discs large gene was cloned and the gene product was localized to sites of cell-cell contact in epithelial cells [77] and in presynaptic nerve termini of the central nervous system [21]. The localization of discs large to sites of cell-cell contact may be due to its interaction with cytoskeletal proteins such as the 4.1 protein, which associates with discs large through its amino-terminal 30 kDa domain [77]. The 30 kDa domain of 4.1 protein is conserved in other family members that include ezrin, talin and merlin, which have been localized to sites of cell-to-cell contact as well as cell-to-substrate contact

been localized to punctate clusters appearing at the leading edge of migrating epithelial cells [85]. Also, the APC found in neuronal processes appears clustered at synaptic densities, as does hdlg [21]. Therefore hdlg may promote localization of APC to higher order protein complexes. Loss of hdlg binding to APC would likely impair APC function in some fashion but perhaps not enough to promote polyposis, as mutations in APC predicted to eliminate only the hdlg binding site are extremely uncommon.

### 5.2. EBl

Using the yeast two hybrid system with a fragment of APC encompassing amino acids 2167–2843 as bait, Su et al. identified a cDNA encoding a novel protein termed EB1 [20]. EB1 associated with wild-type, but not truncated mutant APC, when a GST-EB1 fusion protein was incubated with cell lysates. The reciprocal fishing experiment was also demonstrated and the two proteins formed a complex when cells were cotransfected with the APC and EB1 genes. The EB1 gene was mapped to chromosome 20q11.2 and the cDNA encodes a 268-amino acid protein without significant homology to proteins of known function, although identity to unknown yeast and human sequences was noted. A smaller fragment of APC refined the EB1 binding site to the final 284 amino acids of full length APC. Morin et al. demonstrated that EB1 and β-catenin could simultaneously bind to the same full length APC molecule in cells, suggesting they may function in the same pathway [86]. As with hdlg, APC mutations that would limit the C-terminal deletion of APC to the EB1 binding site are rarely identified in FAP or colorectal tumors.

### 5.3. β-Catenin

β-Catenin was originally identified as a cell adhesion molecule by virtue of its association with the cadherins [49,65,87]. Cadherins are transmembrane proteins responsible for homotypic calcium dependent cell-cell interactions prominent at the apical lateral boundary of epithelial cells and their direct interaction with β-catenin is essential for their normal function in cell adhesion [88,89]. Cadherins make indirect contacts with the actin-based cytoskeleton through α-catenin [90,91], which binds directly to β-catenin amino-terminal sequence [56–59,68]. As with cadherin, β-catenin binds directly to APC and serves as a bridge for α-catenin association [56–58]. Importantly, APC and cadherin never interact, either directly or indirectly through mediation by catenins [57]. Thus APC and cadherin form complexes with the catenins in a similar fashion but represent completely independent physical systems. The APC protein also associates with the β-catenin homolog plakoglobin, also known to bind α-catenin [57,92–94].

That β-catenin has functions in addition to cell adhesion is supported by recent reports that implicate it in signaling pathways that are independent of, and even antagonized by, its interaction with cadherins [63,95]. The wingless/wnt-1 developmental signaling pathways in *Drosophila* and *Xenopus* likely employ β-catenin in the activation of gene transcription [96,97]. In this pathway, β-catenin is stabilized following occupancy of the wingless/wnt-1 transmembrane receptors and consequently accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus [58,98,99]. This translocation presumably involves its association with the transcriptional enhancers of the LEF/TCF family [60,61]. Transcriptional activation by XTCF-3 has been shown to be β-catenin-dependent in the *Xenopus* system [60]. In addition to binding cadherins, APC and LEF/TCF, β-catenin also associates with the EGF and her-2 tyrosine kinase receptors [100,101] and the actin bundling protein fascin [62]. Thus the regulation of β-catenin levels and stability appears to represent a signaling package that impacts upon several downstream targets.

The ability of β-catenin to associate with APC, cadherin, LEF/TCF, the EGF receptor, and fascin is mediated by a series of centrally located armadillo repeat sequences. β-Catenin contains approximately 13 of these tandem repeated motifs [48]. α-Catenin binds to β-catenin independently of APC or cadherin at a site just prior to, and probably partially overlapping, into the first armadillo repeat [57,58,92,98,102]. The amino-terminal region of β-catenin also contains sequence that is essential for its rapid turnover in the cell [99,103]. A mutant lacking 89 N-terminal amino-acids, and still competent for α-catenin binding, exhibited a prolonged half-life relative to wild-type protein [103]. Moreover, mutation of four serine/threonine residues in the amino-terminal region

of Xenopus β-catenin increased its stability and signaling output, suggesting that phosphorylation at specific residues are required to initiate the turnover event. The carboxy-terminal region of β-catenin may contain sequences that are essential for its reception of the wnt-1 signal which promotes the stabilization of β-catenin. This is based on the inability of C-terminal deletion mutants of the Drosophila armadillo protein to accumulate in response to the wnt-1 homolog wingless [98].

### 5.4. Tid 56

Although not confirmed as a protein that normally associates with endogenous APC in cells, a human homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene tid56 was cloned in a yeast 2-hybrid screen using armadillo domains of APC as bait (B. Rubinfeld, P. Polakis, unpublished data). The recombinant protein associated with APC in vitro and coexpression with APC in epithelial cells resulted in its binding APC. Tid56 is homologous to members of the DNAJ family of proteins and its deletion in Drosophila led to hyperplastic growth of epithelial cells in the imaginal discs [104]. Most intriguing is the finding that a yeast DNAJ homolog ydji is required for the rapid turnover of the cyclin Cln3 protein [105]. Given the implications for APC in the turnover of β-catenin, Tid56 may play a similar auxiliary role in this process.

### 6. Cell biology

#### 6.1. Effect of APC on cell growth

The establishment of colon cancer cell lines ectopically expressing full length APC has proven problematic, thus leaving few studies to draw upon. In a study by Groden et al., no clones could be obtained using the SW480 colorectal cancer line, even though numerous vector controls were viable [106]. However, several clones were generated with the HCT116, which unlike the SW480, already contains wildtype APC. Nevertheless, the APC-transfected HCT116 clones exhibited markedly reduced colony formation in soft agar and weaker tumor formation in mice. Morin et al. also noted the inability to achieve stable expression of wildtype APC in the colon cancer cell

HT29, which expresses only mutant APC [86]. In this case, a conditional expression system was employed to obtain two positive cell clones, out of the 250 analyzed, that expressed detectable wildtype APC protein upon induction. Following sustained expression of the APC protein the growth of the cells was strongly retarded. Flow cytometric analysis indicated the cells were not blocked in any particular part of the cell cycle and further analysis demonstrated that their reduction in growth resulted from apoptotic death. The authors concluded that mutations in APC may disrupt the normal balance of cell birth and death that occurs along the crypt-villus axis in the intestine. Cells mutant for APC still undergo apoptosis in vivo, however, as apoptotic bodies were detected at much higher frequency in adenomatous tissue from FAP patients compared to normal mucosa [107]. Although apoptosis occurs in adenomas lacking wildtype APC, it may nevertheless be incapable of keeping pace with an enhanced rate of cell proliferation.

Expression of APC has also been reported to inhibit proliferation of fibroblasts by blocking their progression into S phase of the cell cycle [108]. In a colony formation assay, 10-fold fewer colonies of kidney fibroblast CV-1 cells were obtained following transfection with full length APC compared to vector control. A reduction in BrdU-positive cells was also observed following microinjection of plasmid expressing APC into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Although an approximate 77% reduction in BrdU-positive cells was obtained with wildtype APC, mutant APCs, expressing only codons 1–1338 and 1–932 also inhibited BrdU incorporation by 33% and 55%, respectively. Coinjection of these mutant constructs with full length APC retarded its ability to inhibit BrdU incorporation, leaving Baeg et al. to conclude that the mutants may have a dominant negative effect on wildtype APC. The block to S-phase entry by wildtype APC was overcome by coinjection of plasmids expressing cyclins D and E, particularly when accompanied by their respective cdk catalytic subunits. This intriguing finding implies that the cell cycle block by APC may involve inhibition of cell cycle components.

Although it is still unclear whether the inactivation of a single APC gene can contribute to tumor progression in vivo, D'Abaco et al. demonstrated synergy

between mutation of one APC gene and activation of ras in the transformation of cultured murine colon epithelial cells [109]. Conditionally immortalized cell lines, derived from either the Immorto mouse [110] or a cross of this mouse with the APC<sup>min</sup> mouse [111], were tested for transformation following ectopic expression of viral ras. On release from immortalization, both types of ras-infected cells continued to proliferate but only the cells carrying mutant APC formed colonies in soft agar. In tumorigenicity assays, the ras-infected cells expressing mutant APC were much more efficient at growing tumors when injected subcutaneously into mice suggesting that the combination of APC+/− and activated ras is sufficient to initiate tumor growth.

### 6.2. Regulation of β-catenin and the wnt-1 pathway

A reasonably well-defined signaling pathway involving β-catenin has been derived from genetic and biochemical studies in Drosophila [112]. Here, the wingless ligand is thought to activate its receptor frizzled [113] leading to the phosphorylation of the disheveled protein [114], inactivation of zeste-white-3 kinase [115,116], accumulation of the β-catenin homolog armadillo [115], and finally transcription, resulting in cell fate determinations (Fig. 3). Each of these genes have vertebrate counterparts and some parts of the pathway have been demonstrated in Xenopus development [96,117]. Overexpression of the wingless homolog wnt-1 results in Xenopus dorsal axis duplication [118] which is also the endpoint for both the overexpression of β-catenin [58] and a dominant negative form of glycogen synthase kinase 3β, a zeste-white 3 homolog [119,120]. Studies performed with mammalian cells in culture also demonstrated that wnt-1 promoted the posttranscriptional stabilization and consequent accumulation of β-catenin [121,122]. That the APC protein associates with β-catenin raises the issue of whether it too is involved in this pathway, and if so, does it act upstream or downstream of β-catenin accumulation.

The ability of wildtype APC to downregulate the level of cytoplasmic β-catenin when introduced into colorectal SW480 cells, suggests APC functions upstream of β-catenin [123]. This APC activity was localized to the central region of the protein and ascribed specifically to fragments of APC which

housed at least three of the 20-amino acid repeat sequences (Fig. 4). These 20-amino-acid repeats likely represent β-catenin binding sites and their elimination appears critical to tumor formation in vivo. Moreover, fragments of APC containing these 20-amino acid repeats require phosphorylation by glycogen synthase β (GSK3β) in order to bind β-catenin [17]. GSK3β also associated with the APC-β-catenin complex under conditions where cytoplasmic β-catenin was in excess. Together, the observations suggest that APC and GSK3β may function in concert to control cellular β-catenin levels. This is consistent with immunohistochemical data from a study in which β-catenin staining was performed on tumors and normal intestinal mucosa from eight FAP patients. In all cases, β-catenin was confined only to cell to cell contacts in the normal tissue but was also distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus in the adenomas and cancers [124]. Quantitative immunoblotting also revealed overexpression of β-catenin in tumors relative to normal mucosa. Senda et al. noted that β-catenin distribution in adenomas

Fig. 3. The wnt-1 pathway. The secreted wnt ligand interacts with its putative serpentine transmembrane receptor at the plasma membrane. On the cytosolic side, the receptor activates the disheveled protein (dsh) which impacts negatively on glycogen synthase kinase3β (GSK3). Repression of GSK3β results in the accumulation of β-catenin, promoting its association with LEF/TCF. The β-catenin-LEF/TCF complex translocates to the nucleus where target genes (TGs) are transcribed. In this model, APC is depicted as cooperating with GSK3β in the negative regulation of β-catenin.

from APC<sup>min</sup> mice differed from that of normal epithelium in that the pattern appeared diffuse rather than concentrated at the lateral sites of cell to cell contacts [125]. The authors suggested that APC may effect the localization of β-catenin in intestinal epithelial cells.

The downregulation of β-catenin by APC, and the localization of this function to a genetically relevant region of the protein, is compelling evidence for the importance of this APC activity in regulating cell growth. However, a model in which the regulation of

β-catenin is the sole in vivo function of APC is tentative and has obvious limitations. Not all colorectal cancer cells with mutant APC, such as the HT29, exhibit either an obvious maldistribution or excess of β-catenin (P. Polakis, B. Rubinfeld, unpublished data). Moreover, a *Drosophila* homolog of APC has been identified, but its zygotic inactivation does not result in aberrant cell fate determination involving the wingless/armadillo signaling system [22]. Although it is difficult to rule out maternal contribution in *Drosophila* embryonic development, the results sug-

In this experiment, the SW480 colorectal cancer cell is transiently transfected with the indicated APC constructs and total β-catenin is determined by quantitative immunoblotting. β-catenin is normalized to p120rasGAP protein and expressed as a ratio indicated as β-catenin remaining. E-cadherin and empty vector were also included as negative controls.

gest there are ways to regulate β-catenin which do not involve APC. Finally, overexpression of wildtype APC in Xenopus oocytes promotes dorsalization, demonstrating that APC does not antagonize β-catenin signalling in this system, but cooperates with it [126]. Until these inconsistencies are resolved, alternative explanations for the ability of APC to regulate β-catenin levels must be entertained. Perhaps this activity represents an a function intrinsic to APC that allows it to terminate a signal it receives in response to binding β-catenin. Also, it remains possible that the downregulation of β-catenin in cells does not directly involve APC, but is secondary to its more global effects on cell metabolism.

Paramount to the hypothesis that loss of β-catenin regulation contributes to tumor progression is the demonstration that β-catenin accumulation and/or redistribution might contribute to abnormal cell growth. It is already clear that a major outcome of wnt-1 proto-oncogene signaling is the stabilization of

β-catenin and its accumulation in the cytoplasm [121,122]. Accumulation of β-catenin also correlated with its translocation to the nucleus [58,99]. Wnt-1 promoted the development of tumors in mouse mammary epithelium and was mitogenic to and partially transformed epithelial cells in culture [127,128]. Whether all these wnt-1 effects are an outcome of β-catenin stabilization is unclear, but recent evidence suggests this may be the case. Deletion mutants of β-catenin have now been identified that render the protein resistant to rapid turnover in the cell. These mutants accumulate in the cytoplasm, associate to high levels with endogenous wildtype APC [103], as is the case for wnt-1 stimulation [129], and strongly drive the wnt-1/wingless pathway in both Drosophila and Xenopus [58,98,130]. Thus the artificial stabilization of β-catenin can mimic many aspects of wnt-1 expression. Ongoing studies involving the forced expression of such stabilized mutants of β-catenin in mouse mammary gland will help clarify

Fig. 5. The dynamics of β-catenin. Left side: Under normal steady-state conditions, β-catenin associates with cadherin and α-catenin at the adherens junction. Free β-catenin is short-lived and at low concentrations in the cytoplasm. Right side: Under special circumstances, β-catenin is stabilized and free pools accumulate in the cytoplasm and on APC, and possibly LEF and other target proteins (?). The special circumstances include stimulation by wnt-1, specific mutations or deletions in β-catenin amino acid sequence, or loss of wildtype APC. In the later case, introduction of wildtype APC restores the conditions illustrated at left.

the role of β-catenin in wnt-1 oncogenesis. It is also worth noting that some APC<sup>min</sup> mice eventually develop mammary tumors indicating that loss of APC function and overexpression of wnt-1 share a common outcome [131].

Given the potential connection between deregulation of β-catenin and loss of cell growth control, one might expect to find stabilized mutants of β-catenin in cancer. Accordingly, a deletion mutant of β-catenin lacking N-terminal structure required for protein turnover was identified in a cell line derived from a stomach cancer [132, 133]. A melanoma cell line containing a point mutation in an amino-terminal serine residue critical for β-catenin turnover has also been identified [134, 135]. Moreover, an N-terminal deletion mutant of β-catenin was selected for by random expression cloning of cDNAs in NIH3T3 cells, followed by isolation of morphologically transformed colonies [136]. Although circumstantial, the ability of the wnt-1 proto-oncogene to stabilize β-catenin, the overexpression of β-catenin in some cancer cells, and the expression of stabilized mutants of β-catenin in certain transformed cells, points to β-catenin accumulation as an important event in growth control. This accumulation likely provides for the stable interaction of β-catenin with numerous targets, including cadherins, fascin, APC, the EGF receptor, and the TCF/LEF transcriptional enhancers, all of which might contribute to a common program for cell growth control (Fig. 5).

### 6.3. The microtubule connection

The APC protein is expressed at fairly low levels in the cell and is consequently difficult to detect by immunofluorescent staining of fixed cells. The first reports on the intracellular localization of APC resulted from its detection following transient overexpression in various cell lines. In these studies the ectopically expressed wildtype APC colocalized with the microtubule network, whereas a truncated APC, representative of that expressed in colon cancer cells, did not [18, 19]. Subsequently, high resolution immunofluorescent images of endogenous APC in epithelial cells were reported. In these images wildtype APC is present in highly concentrated clusters localized to actively migrating regions of the cell membranes, with microtubules extending into the clusters

[85]. The punctate APC staining pattern became diffuse and cytoplasmic on disruption of microtubules by nocodazole, whereas disruption of the actin filament network had little effect. Induction of cell migration either by wounding the monolayer or treatment with HGF/scatter factor resulted in the intensification of APC clusters to the migrating edge of the cell membrane. It was concluded that APC might contribute to the process of epithelial cell migration. This hypothesis is consistent with a model for adenoma formation in which intestinal crypt cells are rendered incapable of migration and accumulate rather than exit along the axis to the luminal surface.

## 7. Genotype-phenotype correlation

### 7.1. Classical polyposis

Is there any relationship between the severity of intestinal polyposis and position of APC germline mutation? The first study to address this issue reported that profuse polyp formation correlated with mutations between codons 1250 and 1464 and sparse formation occurred with mutations elsewhere [30]. This is consistent with additional studies reporting that a five base pair deletion at codon 1309 mutation, the most common APC germline mutation, was usually associated with severe polyposis, in comparison to mutations elsewhere or of unknown location [29, 31, 32, 137]. In two of these studies, it was noted that the second most common germline mutation, a five base pair deletion at codon 1061, was not associated with the severe phenotype [31, 137]. By contrast, Paul et al. reported innumerable polyps in some patients carrying the 1061 mutation [138]. In addition, patients with a constitutional germline deletion of the APC gene exhibited a classical FAP phenotype [139]. Although a more severe phenotype is generally associated with the 1309 mutation site, there appears to be considerable heterogeneity among individuals with this mutation [29, 136, 137, 140]. Sixteen patients from nine unrelated families all carrying the 1309 mutation had polyp densities ranging from 3.8 to 13.1/cm² and variation within the same family was also apparent [140]. However, even given the heterogeneity in polyp number, the entire range indicated here still falls under the category of severe polyposis.

The interfamilial heterogeneity is not surprising when considering that genetic background has a profound impact on the number of polyps presented by different strains of mice with the identical APC germline mutations. Distinct genetic loci that modify the polyposis outcome in mice have been identified [141, 142].

### 7.2. Attenuated APC (AAPC)

In some cases, mutations in the APC gene are associated with late onset or attenuated forms of FAP, where polyp count is very low and onset of colorectal cancer is delayed by two decades. However, it is not clear that these mutations result in complete inactivation of the mutant APC gene and low levels of normal product might still be produced. In some instances, such as those mutations occurring in either exon 9 or in the extreme 5′ region of the open reading frame, the mutation may be circumvented by alternative splicing of the transcripts. The so-called attenuated APC (AAPC) is due to chain terminating mutations located in either exon 3 or 4 that predict truncated proteins ranging in length from 97–156 amino [143, 144]. It was difficult to explain how constitutional germline deletions of APC resulted in classical polyposis [139] while potential expression of an extremely truncated gene product resulted in a sparing phenotype. This paradox may have been resolved by the identification of alternatively spliced transcripts lacking exons 3 and 4 [47]. This suggests that protein with an intact carboxy-terminus could still be produced by omission of the exons containing the frameshift mutations. That polyposis still occurs, albeit late, could be explained by production an insufficient amount of this near-wildtype protein. Mutations in exon 6 have also been associated with late onset FAP [145], although it is not clear if alternative splicing accounts for this.

Late onset polyposis has also been attributed to a mutation in the +5 position of the splice donor site of exon 9. This mutation results in the connection of exon 8 directly to exon 10 with a consequent frameshift introducing a stop codon at nucleotide position 1358 [146]. However, due to inefficient exon skipping, a low level of normal transcript is still produced from this mutant allele, suggesting again that low levels of normal APC protein may delay onset of the phenotype. Exon 9 is known to undergo alternative splicing [2, 66] and a mutation identified in the alternatively spliced region of this exon has been correlated with late onset of polyposis [147]. The alternate exon 9 splice form of APC is transcribed at lower levels than the longer form and therefore sub-optimal levels of wildtype APC protein may account for delayed symptoms. There is also a bias for exon 9 mutations to occur in the region of the exon not subject to alternative splicing, suggesting a trend for selection of a fully inactivated APC gene in tumor progression.

Finally, attenuated forms of FAP may result from mutations that occur significantly 3′ to what is normally regarded as the boundary for inactivation of APC by polypeptide chain termination. Late onset FAP was reported for two families with a frameshift at codon 1597 [148]. Since this mutation lies somewhat downstream of the 3′ boundary of the normal mutation spectrum, it is possible that some residual tumor suppressor activity is retained by this larger truncated protein. This is particularly interesting in light of biochemical evidence delineating the minimal structure of the APC protein required for the down-regulation β-catenin in cultured cells (Fig. 3). APC fragments containing two or fewer of the 20-amino acid repeat sequences lacked this activity, those containing three had partial activity, and those with greater than 3 appeared wildtype. Therefore, the APC mutant truncated at codon 1597 would be expected to have an attenuated activity toward β-catenin in this assay. Although this agrees with the attenuated FAP phenotype for the 1597 mutant, it is inconsistent with a second, more 3′, mutation reported for a family exhibiting a wide variation in severity of polyposis and age of cancer onset. This mutation occurs at nucleotide 5934 in the APC ORF introducing a stop at codon 2044 [149]. The mutation causes a frameshift that adds 63 amino acids of nonAPC sequence prior to the stop codon. It was suggested that this additional sequence may play a role in determining the phenotype.

### 7.3. Extracolonic phenotypes

In the case of CHRPEs, an ocular lesion commonly associated with FAP, there is strong evidence for a correlation between position of the APC

germline mutation and severity. Severity of CHRPEs increased with mutations occurring 3' to approximately codon 450, contained in exon 9, and were rarely associated with mutations 5' to exon 9 [27]. This exon 9 boundary and its relationship to CHRPEs has since been confirmed numerous times [24–26,28]. One could speculate that the size of the mutant truncated APC protein may be critical to its ability to negatively interfere with wildtype APC protein by hetero-oligomerization. However, the protein structure essential for oligomerization has been mapped to the extreme amino-terminus of APC, and predicts that proteins produced from genes mutated 5' to exon 9 would nevertheless associate with wildtype protein [14,15]. It is possible these proteins are unstable and would thus never have the opportunity to form oligomers. Alternatively, mutant APC proteins of the appropriate size could acquire a gain-of-function activity independent of the wild type protein. When referring to the protein structure map of APC (Fig. 1) it is intriguing to note that the CHRPEs boundary correlates with the inclusion of the armadillo repeat sequences in the mutant protein. The armadillo repeats likely represent sites of binding for APC partners and their association with the mutant APC protein could generate a complex that contributes directly to CHRPEs formation.

An additional twist on the CHRPEs correlation was the finding that FAP patients carrying mutations 3' to codon 1444 did not exhibit this phenotype [25]. Thus CHRPEs appear to correlate with mutations occurring within a zone of the open reading frame loosely defined by codons 450 to 1444. Perhaps extension of the protein structure to amino acid 1444 allows for an intramolecular association that negates the CHRPEs forming activity of shorter APC mutant proteins. The study describing the lack of CHRPEs with mutations beyond codon 1444 also noted that 33 of 36 patients in this category developed desmoid tumors. It was suggested that there may be an inverse correlation between CHRPEs formation and development of desmoid tumors.

decorated with a number of interesting motifs and binding sites. The most prominent of these features are the β-catenin binding sites which exist in multiple copies scattered throughout the middle one-third of the linear amino acid sequence. The polyposis phenotype appears to depend upon the deletion of a number of these binding sites, usually at least five, and milder phenotypes occur if fewer sites are deleted. The purpose of β-catenin binding to these sites is unclear and can be viewed from more than one perspective. First, β-catenin, when stabilized, may associate with APC and inactivate its basal growth suppressor function. This might explain the tumorigenic properties of the wnt-1 proto-oncogene whose signaling output is the stabilization of β-catenin and its accumulation on the APC protein. Second, APC may control the overall intracellular levels of β-catenin and loss of this activity promotes hyper-interaction of β-catenin with other growth promoting downstream targets. This is consistent with elevated levels of β-catenin observed in some cancer cells with mutant APC and the ability of wildtype APC to eliminate this. Third, APC may regulate cell adhesion or migration by controlling the interaction of β-catenin with cadherin or fascin in a highly localized fashion. This agrees with the clustering of APC at sites of plasma membrane extensions. The identification of mutations in β-catenin in cancers that specifically increase its stability suggest its regulation is critical to growth control. Future research should determine whether APC controls β-catenin or whether β-catenin controls it.
