### The exogenous pathway for antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex class II and CD1 molecules

#### Colin Watts

The endosomes and lysosomes of antigen-presenting cells host the processing and assembly reactions that result in the display of peptides on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and lipid-linked products on CD1 molecules. This environment is potentially hostile for T cell epitope and MHC class II survival, and the influence of regulators of protease activity and specialized chaperones that assist MHC class II assembly is crucial. At present, evidence indicates that individual proteases make both constructive and destructive contributions to antigen processing for MHC class II presentation to CD4 T cells. Some features of CD1 antigen capture within the endocytic pathway are also discussed.

Peptide capture by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules faces challenges different from those faced by MHC class I, as reviewed elsewhere in this issue. In the case of MHC class I, the initial events of antigen processing are segregated from the events of MHC peptide assembly by the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Moreover, access to the proteasome is regulated, for example, by ubiquitination. In contrast, a single compartmental system hosts exogenous antigen processing and the loading of peptides onto MHC class II molecules. Incoming antigen substrates encounter a variety of proteases, most with broad specificity. Intuitively, it seems likely that the half-life of appropriate MHC class II binding peptides would be short and the time available for engagement by MHC class II would be limited before complete destruction occurs. Whereas MHC class I peptide capture and assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum occurs in an environment dedicated to protein folding and subunit assembly, MHC class II must accomplish a similar feat but in an environment usually associated with protein catabolism. However, the strict peptide length requirements for MHC class I are relaxed for MHC class II. MHC class I and II molecules solve these distinct challenges in different ways.

#### Overview of the MHC class II pathway

The essential features of MHC class II assembly with the invariant chain (Ii) and transport of this complex to the endocytic pathway have been reviewed well<sup>1-3</sup> and are only outlined here. The MHC class II α- and β-chains engage the Ii, a type II membrane protein that serves as both a targeting subunit and guardian of the peptide-binding site. Trimerization of the Ii, driven by both the luminal C-terminal domain and transmembrane domains, brings in three MHC class II molecules to form a nonameric complex. Removal of the Ii is accomplished by an ordered proteolytic reaction (discussed below), leading to the generation of a fragment of about 3 kilodaltons (kDa), called class II invariant chain peptide (CLIP), lodged in the peptide-binding groove. The DM protein, whose function is modulated by DO in B cells, then catalyzes the dissociation of CLIP (and sometimes longer fragments), stabilizes the empty MHC class II molecule and assists in peptide selection.

Antigen processing takes place in broadly the same compartments as Ii processing<sup>4</sup>. MHC class II molecules display peptides of variable length, often encompassing a core sequence, which is variably extended in both the N- and C-terminal directions<sup>5</sup>. Peptide-loaded MHC class II molecules travel to the cell surface after Ii removal and peptide binding has occurred. Most evidence indicates that MHC class II–Ii complexes enter the endocytic pathway early, capture peptides at different points along the pathway and can probably exit at any point, even from lysosomes<sup>6</sup>. Inhibition of Ii processing results in exaggerated accumulation of some MHC class II haplotypes in late endosomes and lysosomes. Once on the cell surface, peptide–MHC class II (pMHC) complexes are long lived, preserving a record of antigen encounters that may have been both temporally and spatially distant, such as those experienced by tissue dendritic cells<sup>7</sup>. Such pMHC complexes survive repeated exposure to the endosome environment during endocytic recycling, yet some T cell epitopes made available in early endosomes can nonetheless engage ‘recycling’ MHC class II molecules that either reach the cell surface empty or more likely, have exchanged their peptide<sup>8</sup>.

Processing enzymes

Processing of protein antigens in the MHC class II pathway is achieved by endopeptidases, exopeptidases and γ-interferon-induced lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT). Several cysteine proteases have been linked to Ii and antigen processing. At present, involvement of metalloproteases or enzymes with an active-site aspartic acid or serine is not firmly established, although reports have linked such enzymes to antigen processing^{9–11}. The principal cysteine proteases described are the papain-like cathepsins S, L, B, F and H and, in humans, cathepsin V, together with the unrelated cysteine protease asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), also known as mammalian legumain^{12–14}. Given that there are multiple enzymes mostly with broad specificity, a key question concerns the level of redundancy in the system. Thus, are specific enzyme activities required for Ii and antigen processing or is ‘generic’ protease activity sufficient? How is the hierarchy of presentation of dominant, subdominant and cryptic epitopes affected, if at all, by the processing activities available?

Ii processing

Chemical and genetic ablation of lysosomal cysteine proteases has shown that Ii processing is a staged process proceeding in a C-terminal-to-N-terminal direction (Fig. 1). In biosynthetic pulse-chase experiments, the cysteine protease inhibitor leupeptin induces the accumulation of a 22-kDa or 10-kDa Ii product in human or mouse cells, respectively^{15,16}. The leupeptin-insensitive enzyme responsible for initiating Ii processing in these conditions is AEP, which targets asparagine residue 155 (Asn155) and probably Asn132 on the outside of the trimerized C-terminal domain^{17}. Processing of mouse Ii proceeds further because of an additional, more N-terminally located asparagine residue. However, Ii processing can also be initiated by proteases other than AEP^{17}. Given the importance of Ii removal, this may not be unexpected. In human cells there are at least two subsequent steps in Ii processing (Fig. 1). Inhibition of cathepsin S leads to the accumulation of a processing intermediate of approximately 10 kDa (p10)^{18}. Processing of this smaller target is less redundant, and the terminal stages of Ii processing are dependent on cathepsin S, at least in some MHC class II haplotypes. In its absence or in leupeptin-treated cells, MHC class II I-A^b-p10 complexes accumulate in late endosomes and lysosomes, slowing but not completely inhibiting transport to the cell surface^{19,20}. The enzyme(s) that converts p22 to p10 in human cells has not been identified (Fig. 1).

Murine thymic cortex epithelial cells lack cathepsin S and instead use the related enzyme cathepsin L to process the MHC class II-Ii p10 intermediate^{21}. The enzyme(s) responsible for terminal processing of the Ii in the human thymus is uncertain and has been variously attributed to the cathepsin L-related enzyme cathepsin V^{22} and/or cathepsin S^{23}. Murine macrophages lacking cathepsin S continue to process the Ii, albeit more slowly, because of the activity of cathepsin F^{24}.

Given its importance in Ii processing, cathepsin S has been promoted as a potential target for immunosuppression. Indeed, studies using cathepsin S inhibitors have shown alleviation of CD4 T cell-mediated disease in murine models of Sjogren syndrome^{25} and pulmonary hypersensitivity^{26}, whereas cathepsin S-deficient mice are less susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis^{27}. However, in some cases these effects are unlikely to be due to interference with Ii processing. The H-2^q haplotype involved in the two autoimmune models shows little dependence on cathepsin S for removal of p10 from MHC class II, in contrast to other haplotypes such as H-2^d and H-2^b (refs. 27,28). More likely, cathepsin S may be involved in type II collagen processing in the arthritis model^{27} or in some other process needed for disease progression in the other models. Enzymes in addition to cathepsin S may be targeted by chemical inhibitors *in vivo*, where it is more difficult to administer an amount of inhibitor that is specific^{26}. The importance of these caveats is emphasized by studies reporting diminished MHC class II expression on cells treated with inhibitors of cathepsin S in conditions in which Ii processing was not affected^{29} or was unlikely to be affected^{25}.

A further Ii processing event may serve a completely different function. Mice lacking the Ii have a defect in B cell development that can be rescued by expression of residues 1–82 of the Ii^{30}. The cytosolic domain of the Ii is released by an intramembrane proteolytic cleavage at residues 42–44 and initiates a signaling cascade culminating in activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and B cell differentiation^{31} (Fig. 1). The intramembrane cleavage event occurs only after cleavage of the luminal domain of the Ii, although how much must be removed is unclear. It might be useful to assess release of the Ii cytosolic domain in cathepsin S-deficient mice in which there are defects in germinal center formation, although not, apparently, a generalized defect in B cell development^{32}.

Chaperones of the MHC class II pathway: DM and DO

Removal of CLIP, which occupies the binding groove after Ii processing, is catalyzed by the MHC class II homolog DM^{33–35}, formerly known as H2-M (mouse) or HLA-DM (human). DM induces and/or stabilizes an MHC class II conformation from which weakly bound peptides (including but not

Figure 1 Ii processing proceeds in a C-terminal-to-N-terminal direction. A nonameric complex of three MHC class II αβ dimers, each combined with the Ii, moves to the endosome-lysosome system. For simplicity, only the 31-kDa form of the Ii (p31) is shown here. Other intermediates in processing include p22, p10 and CLIP. The p22 and p10 intermediate forms are known to maintain a trimeric complex^{16,129} due to additional interactions in the transmembrane domain. DM releases CLIP and, with reduced efficiency, catalyzes release of the p10 intermediate as well^{130}. Intramembrane proteolysis of the Ii releases an N-terminal fragment that drives B cell differentiation via NF-κB activation. Scissors represent proteases.
limited to CLIP) are able to dissociate, as has been well reviewed<sup>36–38</sup>. Stabilization of the MHC class II protein by DM during the process of peptide selection parallels the function of tapasin in the MHC class I pathway<sup>39</sup>. Whether DM works mainly by influencing peptide side-chain interactions or conserved main-chain hydrogen-bonding networks is under investigation<sup>40,41</sup>. In the absence of DM, the peptide-editing process fails, leading to the appearance of weakly bound peptides (especially CLIP) and peptide-MHC class II conformations that are structurally immature and recognizable by specific T cells<sup>42</sup>. The DM-deficient phenotype varies considerably according to the MHC class II haplotype being examined<sup>43–45</sup>, probably reflecting variable dependence on DM for eviction of Ii processing products and variable dependence on DM for MHC class II stabilization in the peptide-free state. For example, loss of DM results in reduced expression of I-A<sup>k</sup>, low amounts of SDS-stable I-A<sup>k</sup> dimers and reduced antigen presentation on I-A<sup>k</sup> molecules, whereas in the same cells, I-E<sup>k</sup> is not detectably affected<sup>46</sup>. Information on the interaction interface between MHC class II and DM and *in vitro* assays for peptide loading in the presence of both should allow more detailed analysis of the DM mechanism<sup>47</sup>.

DO is another MHC class II-like heterodimer expressed mainly in B cells. Its trafficking to MHC class II compartments requires tight association with DM<sup>48</sup>. Establishment of how DO affects DM function has not been completely straightforward, with early studies demonstrating both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on DM’s ability to remove CLIP and influence peptide binding. However, in human B cells there was a clear correlation between DO expression and increased expression of MHC class II-CLIP, indicating an overall inhibitory effect on DM<sup>49,50</sup>, perhaps modulated by genetic background<sup>51</sup>. *In vitro* studies have shown that DO modifies DM function by narrowing and lowering the pH range over which DM works<sup>52,53</sup>. Thus, for DM-dependent T cell epitopes, loading in more acidic ‘later’ endosome compartments might be favored compared with loading in less acidic ‘early’ compartments. This hypothesis has led to the suggestion that DO, acting through DM, may enhance the presentation of B cell receptor-bound antigens in B cells<sup>38</sup> because they are transported more efficiently to late compartments and, moreover, may be better protected (compared with non-receptor-bound antigens) from protease attack there<sup>54</sup>. For antigens taken up nonspecifically, presentation is either inhibited or unaffected by the presence of DO<sup>55,56</sup>. In contrast, presentation of some, though not all, epitopes is indeed enhanced by DO when antigen is taken up via the B cell receptor in hapten-specific B cells from wild-type versus DO-deficient mice. However, these DO-dependent enhancements are less apparent with those hapten-B cell receptor combinations that have the highest avidity at acidic endosomal pH (ref. 56). It will be worthwhile to probe this further with B cells that have specificity for precisely defined epitopes rather than attached haptens, as B cell receptor antigen complexes with varying geometries (due to multiple hapten groups) are presumably internalized and processed in the latter conditions<sup>56</sup>. An important finding is that DO expression is downmodulated in B cells in germinal centers. Thus, DO expression may broadly suppress B cell antigen presentation function outside this environment while permitting presentation by the highest avidity B cells emerging from the affinity maturation process<sup>49,50</sup>

### Antigen processing

Immunization with synthetic peptides often blurs the distinct hierarchy of dominant, subdominant and cryptic T cell responses seen with whole antigen<sup>57</sup>. Thus, antigen processing is thought to be a key determinant of the quality and quantity of a CD4 T cell response. Evidence that individual enzymes make distinct and nonredundant contributions to this hierarchy would encourage efforts to manipulate vaccine candidates so that their processing is ‘tuned’ to the processing machinery. This could mean insertion and/or removal of protease-sensitive sites to optimize MHC class II loading. Different groups have investigated the protease requirements for antigen processing in different ways. Experiments taking advantage of mice lacking cathepsin B and cathepsin S have shown that degradation of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled F(ab)<sub>2</sub> fragments is considerably reduced in the absence of cathepsin B and, to a lesser extent, cathepsin S<sup>58</sup>. Cathepsin S was also found to be required for presentation of two of three H-2<sup>b</sup>-restricted T cell epitopes examined in hen egg lysozyme. The affected epitopes (amino acids 30–44 and 46–59) are separated by a cathepsin S cleavage site at position 45 (ref. 59). Another study described embryonic fibroblasts expressing I-A<sup>b</sup> MHC class II molecules and, additionally, either cathepsin S or cathepsin L. As expected, antigen presentation to a panel of T cell hybridomas was in most cases boosted by either cathepsin S or cathepsin L expression because of more efficient Ii processing. Analysis of peptides eluted from the I-A<sup>b</sup> molecules showed that although many peptides were loaded irrespective of cathepsin S or cathepsin L expression, display of a smaller set of peptides was positively or negatively affected<sup>60</sup>. The same group also identified a likely function for cathepsin L in the generation of peptides in thymic epithelial cells that select CD4 T cells; that is, in addition to its function in Ii processing in these cells<sup>61</sup>. Other labs have analyzed the ability of endosomal and lysosomal fractions isolated from APCs to degrade protein substrates *in vitro*. Such an approach led to the identification of AEP as the dominant processing activity for a 47-kDa C-terminal fragment of tetanus toxin<sup>62</sup>. AEP is not related to the lysosomal cathepsins but instead to caspases and separase<sup>63</sup> and has strict specificity for cleaving at asparagine and in rare cases, aspartic acid residues<sup>64</sup>. Mutagenesis of AEP cleavage sites or blockade of the enzyme with a covalent inhibitor slowed presentation of many T cell epitopes in that C-terminal fragment of tetanus toxin<sup>65,66</sup>.

More data are needed, but the available evidence indicates that specific enzymes are required for optimal generation of some T cell epitopes in the MHC class II pathway, whereas other epitopes may have less specific processing requirements. Some epitopes are susceptible to destructive processing (*Fig.* 2). For example, in the study described above<sup>60</sup>, presentation of an epitope from immunoglobulin M was diminished by cathepsin L or S expression. Presentation of residues 85–99 from myelin basic protein (MBP(85–99)) is inversely proportional to cellular AEP activity because of a destructive processing event at Asn94, which may explain why central tolerance is not established to MBP(85–99)<sup>67</sup>. This epitope binds to human DR2 MHC class II molecules and is thought to be important in the pathology of the inflammatory demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. The MBP(85–99)-DR2 complex has been detected in central nervous system tissue from patients with multiple sclerosis<sup>68</sup>; thus, differential processing of the same protein may occur in different tissues (for example, thymus versus central nervous system). Such a situation may permit the presentation of ‘self’ epitopes to which tolerance has not been established and so induce or sustain an autoimmune reaction<sup>57</sup>. Epitopes susceptible to destructive processing might survive if they can be loaded early in the MHC class II pathway, for example, onto recycling MHC class II molecules<sup>8</sup>. An association with the B cell antigen receptor that is too tight may actually put such epitopes at a disadvantage, probably by targeting to more proteolytically aggressive late endosomes or lysosomes<sup>69</sup>.
REVIEW

on other enzymes. Cathepsin L, for example, has a complex set of interactions: the autocatalytically activated single-chain 30-kDa form is converted by AEP to a disulfide-linked two-chain form<sup>78</sup>, whereas cathepsin S and other cysteine proteases contribute to the turnover of cathepsin L<sup>79</sup>. In some<sup>80</sup> but not all<sup>81</sup> cells, some of the two-chain form is stabilized and maintained in an active form at neutral pH by association with a 65-residue fragment from the p41 isoform of the Ii<sup>82-84</sup>. In interferon-γ-treated macrophages, mature cathepsin L protein is present but not active because of the expression of a potent, though as-yet-unidentified, inhibitor<sup>85</sup>. Given that the activity of cathepsin L is likely to determine the expression of at least some T cell epitopes, these various activators, inhibitors and chaperones may indirectly influence antigen presentation<sup>86</sup> and some will make their own direct contributions (Fig. 3). Thus, cathepsin L activity may be low in B cells because of efficient conversion to the two-chain form by AEP, small amounts of its chaperone p41 Ii and large amounts of cathepsin S, which degrade it. *In vivo*, where cells are closely apposed to each other, the enzyme profile of a cell may be the sum of endogenously synthesized plus exogenously captured products. In a study using bone marrow-chimeric mice, cathepsin L was shown to be acquired by cathepsin L-deficient thymocytes from cathepsin L-sufficient thymic epithelial cells and, moreover, partially rescued antigen presentation to natural killer T cells (NKT cells) mediated by thymocyte CD1 molecules<sup>81</sup>.

Regulatory influences on endosomal pH in APCs include proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines<sup>87</sup> and microbial products such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)<sup>88</sup>. LPS triggers enhanced vacuolar proton ATPase function in immature dendritic cells (DCs), lower endosomal or lysosomal pH and more efficient antigen processing<sup>88</sup>. One effect of LPS-induced maturation in both murine<sup>88</sup> and human<sup>89</sup> DCs is to drive the conversion of proteases such as AEP from inactive precursors to active mature forms. These biochemical changes are likely to act in synergy with LPS-induced alterations in the morphology of MHC class II- and DM-containing compartments<sup>90,91</sup> and with enhanced MHC synthesis<sup>92</sup>. Nonetheless, nominally ‘immature’ DC populations *in vivo* can assemble self peptide-MHC class II complexes and induce tolerance in CD4 T cells<sup>93</sup>. Consistent with this, DCs isolated *ex vivo* from lymphoid organs constitutively present self and exogenous antigens to T cells and generate mature MHC class II complexes<sup>94,95</sup>. Thus DC populations *in vivo* can apparently uncouple the development of antigen presentation capacity from the appearance of costimulatory function. LPS-induced DC maturation may nonetheless serve to increase the efficiency of the overall pathway, ‘fix’ pMHC complexes on the cell surface by reducing endocytosis<sup>92,95</sup> and coordinate the appearance of MHC class II-peptide complexes together with costimulatory molecules at the DC-T cell interface<sup>91,96,97</sup>.

Tubules are elaborated after LPS challenge and mediate the transport of MHC class II to the cell surface, as shown both at the ultrastructural level<sup>90</sup> and in living cells expressing a fusion protein of

Disulfide bonds in protein antigens can influence presentation on MHC class II molecules either when a T cell epitope sequence contains a cysteine residue involved in a disulfide bond in native antigen (Fig. 2) or when a disulfide bond distant from the actual T cell epitope constrains antigen processing<sup>12,70,71</sup>. GILT is expressed in MHC class II-positive APCs and reduces disulfide-bonded or cysteinylated antigens<sup>72,73</sup>. GILT is required for efficient presentation of T cell epitopes in both categories described above<sup>74,75</sup>, and its upregulation by interferon-γ suggests that GILT may contribute to changes in the hierarchy of T cell epitope presentation in different environmental conditions.

A class of T cell-activating zwitterionic polysaccharides from *Bacteroides fragilis* and other abscess-inducing bacteria has been reported to bind to MHC class II molecules in a DM-dependent way, but only after oxidative processing that requires a functional nitric oxide synthesis pathway<sup>76,77</sup>. These unusual features differentiate these zwitterionic polysaccharides from superantigens and raise the possibility that the MHC fold can bind not only peptide and lipid ligands but carbohydrate as well. The actual mode of binding of zwitterionic polysaccharides to MHC class II remains to be defined, however.

Regulation of processing activity

A complex set of interlinked factors is likely to influence the activity of the processing enzymes found in the MHC class II pathway. These include local pH and concentrations of endogenous inhibitors, activators and chaperones. For example, other proteases may be required to activate protease precursors or catalyze their turnover (Fig. 3). In this situation, elimination of one enzyme may have ‘downstream’ effects
MHC class II and green fluorescent protein<sup>91</sup>. In the presence of specific T cells, long MHC class II–containing tubules are directed to the DC–T cell interface, but only if the interaction is cognate; that is, if a certain amount of specific pMHC complexes is already on the cell surface<sup>97</sup>. The quality rather than the quantity of such pMHC complexes is crucial, as T cells induce the formation of MHC class II tubules in protein-pulsed but not in peptide-pulsed DCs, even though the latter are equally stimulatory for T cells<sup>98</sup>. Thus, physiological antigen presentation may deliver pMHC complexes to the cell surface in a configuration not reproduced by peptide pulsing. For example, after insertion into the plasma membrane, pMHC complexes generated by endosomal processing may stay together in a microdomain stabilized by association with tetraspan proteins and/or by glycosphingolipids and cholesterol domains<sup>99,100</sup>. Taken together, these results indicate that there is more to learn about the microenvironment of peptide loading in the MHC class II pathway.

### Epitope survival and MHC class II loading

The MHC class II compartment is a potentially hostile environment for T cell epitope survival, and professional APCs need to balance the creative and destructive proteolytic forces acting on antigen substrates. Because partially processed and unfolded antigen is likely to be even more sensitive to destructive processing, rapid engagement of MHC class II molecules would seem to be desirable, and the open-ended binding groove of MHC class II is ideally suited and perhaps designed for this process. Many studies have shown that MHC class II can engage peptides of much greater length than those typically eluted from MHC class II and that this can occur during normal processing<sup>101–104</sup>. Detailed analysis of peptides eluted from MHC class II is also consistent with the idea that processing by specific endopeptidases continues after MHC binding<sup>105,106</sup>. Moreover, the flanking residues that remain after these final ‘in situ’ cleavages can be crucial for T cell recognition<sup>107</sup>. What is less clear is whether this ‘bind first, trim later’ model is the canonical mode of operation (Fig. 2). The evidence that MHC class II molecules compete for capture of an extended ‘pro-determinant’ has been reviewed<sup>108</sup>. The ‘losing’ epitopes in such a competition do not necessarily have lower affinity for MHC class II but instead are disfavored by their constrained location in the unfolding protein (Fig. 2). Further efforts to establish which scenario prevails in different APCs are needed and may help optimize vaccine design. For example, if capture of extended sequences is the norm, there may be little point placing processing sites adjacent to T cell epitopes. Equally, tandem arrangements of multiple T cell epitopes may not achieve the desired objective of maximizing the number of determinants displayed to CD4 T cells.

### CD1

Because CD1 molecules patrol the endocytic pathway, engage ligands there for presentation to T cells and are affected by elimination of proteins that also affect MHC class II presentation, a brief summary of those aspects is presented here. However, this is necessarily incomplete, and other reviews provide a more thorough discussion<sup>109,110</sup>.

CD1 molecules are MHC-like proteins that bind β₂ microglobulin but, in contrast to MHC class I, their principal domain of action is in the endocytic pathway. Two classes of CD1 proteins can be distinguished: those that are recognized by conventional αβ T cells (CD1a–CD1c and CD1e) and that present lipid antigens such as mycolic acid and lipopeptides from mycobacteria, and CD1d, which is the restricting element for the specific subset of cells, usually called NKT cells, that express an invariant Vα14 (mouse) or Vα24 (human) T cell receptor and are selected on double-positive thymocytes rather than thymic epithelial cells<sup>109–111</sup>. By binding to lipid-based molecules,

CD1 proteins diversify the range of determinants in foreign pathogens that the immune system can recognize. In addition, CD1d is linked to regulation of antitumor, autoreactive and other immune responses through the display of self lipids, although information on these lipid ligands is still limited<sup>109,110</sup>.

The biosynthetic ‘itinerary’ and steady-state distribution of CD1 molecules is controlled by cytoplasmic tail motifs that interact differentially with sorting adaptors such as AP2 and AP3. These and probably other interactions result in continual cycling of CD1 molecules through the endocytic system but with steady-state distributions that broadly place CD1a and CD1c in early endosomes and CD1b and CD1d in late endosome and/or lysosomes. Lipid ligand selection is probably controlled by a combination of differential CD1 trafficking and by intrinsic binding-site differences among different CD1 molecules<sup>112,113</sup>. CD1b trafficking and antigen presentation are defective in cells from patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, which lack functional AP3 adaptors, consistent with an important function for CD1b trafficking in lipid sampling<sup>114</sup>. In contrast, loss of AP3 in mice affects CD1d, the only CD1 isoform in this species, resulting in defective trafficking to lysosomes and defective NKT cell development<sup>115,116</sup>.

Several groups have shown an association between CD1d and the Ii or between CD1d and MHC class II–Ii complexes<sup>117–119</sup>. The Ii corrects the defective late endosomal sorting and antigen-presenting function of CD1d that lacks a cytoplasmic tail and DCs lacking the Ii, but with normal CD1d molecules shows impaired CD1d antigen-presenting cell function<sup>119</sup>. However, the extent to which the Ii modulates CD1d trafficking and antigen-presenting function *in vivo* is less clear, because the presence of the Ii could not functionally rescue a similar germline deletion in the CD1d tail<sup>120</sup>. Two proteases, cathepsin

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Figure 3 Multiple influences on protease activity in the endocytic compartment. Possible interactions for a single enzyme. Conversion from the proform may be autocatalytic or may involve other enzymes and usually requires acidic pH. Cytokines and pathogen products can regulate endosomal and lysosomal pH. The active enzyme is then subject to inhibition, for example, by cystatins, or destruction by other proteases. Association with chaperones, for example, a fragment of the lip41 in the case of cathepsin L, can slow turnover and boost enzyme amounts<sup>80</sup>. Chaperoned proteases or protease precursors may be generated in one cell, secreted and taken up by another cell<sup>81,84</sup>.
L and cathepsin S, that are known to be involved in II processing are also linked to normal CD1d function. In different studies, defects in the development of the Vα14 subset of NKT cells were noted in mice lacking cathepsin S<sup>121</sup> or cathepsin L<sup>81</sup>, although the latter study, which examined both types of cathepsin-deficient mice, only noted defects in the absence of cathepsin L. In that study<sup>81</sup>, the defect in CD1d reactivity was specific for Vα14-expressing NKT hybridomas and was noted only when thymocytes were used as APCs. To account for the defects seen in the absence of cathepsin S, involvement not only of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes (which do not express cathepsin S) but also of thymic DCs in NKT cell development was postulated<sup>121</sup>.

The basis for defective CD1d function in APCs lacking lysosomal cathepsins is not yet resolved. It could be an indirect effect of defective Ii processing and the consequent perturbation of the endocytic pathway that is known to occur<sup>20,121</sup>. However, no obvious compartmental changes were found in thymocytes from cathepsin L–deficient mice<sup>81</sup>. An alternative possibility is that lysosomal cathepsins are required either for processing of specific protein or lipid material that binds to CD1d or for specific activating cleavages in other essential enzymes or cofactors. Sphingolipid activator proteins or saposins have been identified as essential participants in the loading of glycolipid antigens<sup>122–124</sup>. Saposins may act autonomously by extracting glycolipids from lipid bilayers to facilitate loading and lipid exchange on CD1 molecules or they may ‘present’ glycosphingolipids to luminal processing enzymes or activate them by direct interaction. Because the four known saposins (A–D) are proteins approximately 80 amino acids in length derived by ordered proteolytic processing from a single 73-kDa prosaposin precursor<sup>125,126</sup>, protease deficiencies may interfere with normal saposin function. Future studies will no doubt assess directly whether the saposins and other proteins required for loading different CD1 isoforms are fully functional in protease-deficient cells.

### Future prospects

The operation of the MHC class II pathway has often seemed more haphazard than that of MHC class I, yet emerging evidence indicates that processing enzymes can make distinct and nonredundant contributions and affect the efficiency and kinetics of antigen presentation. Future studies will continue to assess the related issues of generic versus specific protease requirement, the generality of the ‘bind-then-trim’ model for antigen capture, the microenvironment of peptide loading on MHC class II and the precise mechanisms of action of DM and DO. More information on antigen processing *in vivo* is also desirable. For example, how do the many peripheral tissue-specific proteins that are ectopically expressed in thymic epithelial cells for tolerance induction access the MHC class II pathway<sup>127,128</sup>? An autophagic mechanism or a ‘cross-presentation’ pathway, involving synthesis by one cell and uptake and processing by another, might be envisaged. In this and other tissue contexts, extracellular processing of antigens for MHC class II presentation may also be a more prominent pathway than is appreciated at present<sup>10</sup>.
