### Aldosterone Secretion
#### A Molecular Perspective
W.C. Boon, J.P. Coghlan, K.M. Curnow, and John G. McDougall

The major mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone is secreted from the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone is synthesized from cholesterol via a series of hydroxylations and oxidations. The enzymes involved in these reactions are mostly members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. The final steps of this pathway, the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) to aldosterone, require conversion via the intermediates 18-hydroxy-DOC or corticosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone. There are significant differences between species in the number of genes that encode the P450<sub>11β</sub>-related enzymes (CYP11B) involved in these steps and the zonal distribution of their expression. One enzyme is capable of 11-hydroxylation, 18-hydroxylation, and 18-oxidation of DOC to aldosterone. The genetic basis of four diseases—congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency, glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism, aldosterone synthase deficiency type I and type II—is explicable by mutations in these cytochrome P450<sub>11β</sub>-related genes.

The regulation of aldosterone secretion was once central among studies of steroidogenesis. The realization of the definitive role of angiotensin in the regulation of aldosterone secretion, and the interest in the secretion of other steroids and their production from circulating precursors, determined by compartmental analysis, have pushed aside a more complete investigation of the aldosterone control systems. This has, to some extent, been left to the cognoscenti. After more than 30 years of intense research, aldosterone has become less “trendy,” but there remains a dedicated band of investigators whose interest has never wavered, even when the technical demands became very hard.

In general, basic physiological studies have focused on the “turn-on” of aldosterone secretion, whereas turning it off is just as important and may be especially relevant in several clinical situations where aldosterone secretion can be recognized as inappropriately high. Similarly, cell biologists have concentrated on receptors, transmembrane signaling, and signal transduction mechanisms inducing aldosterone secretion. Meanwhile, biochemists and molecular biologists have applied their molecular technologies to the identification and characterization of the enzymes that are involved in steroidogenesis, especially the hydroxylases. At the level of the adrenal cortex, this new molecular knowledge has allowed a better appreciation of the functional zonation of the adrenal gland and has shed light on some nagging clinical questions.

- **Regulation of Aldosterone Biosynthesis**

Since the isolation of aldosterone by Simpson et al. (1954), much has been learned about its biosynthesis, regulation of biosynthesis, modes of actions, and metabolism. The further characterization of aldosterone regulation, particularly of the mechanisms turning off aldosterone secretion, may produce clues to the etiology of hypertensive syndromes that are characterized by overproduction of this important mineralocorticoid hormone.

During these past 4 decades, it has become widely accepted that the primary physiological stimulus for aldosterone secretion is angiotensin II (Ang

II), the effector of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). There is a high degree of correlation between plasma Ang II and the secretion rate or blood level of aldosterone in various species studied, such as the sheep (Blair-West et al. 1969), dog (Nicholls et al. 1978), rat (Davis and Spielman 1974), and human (Brown et al. 1972).

Ang II is an octapeptide produced when the decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I) is cleaved by angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). Ang I is derived from angiotensinogen by the action of the enzyme renin (Peart 1969). Renin is secreted by specialized epithelioid cells of the juxtaglomerular afferent arterioles in the kidneys in response to a decrease in intravascular volume or Na⁺ level [refer to review by Kurtz (1989)]. Glomerulosa cells respond to Ang II stimulation via specific Ang II receptors (Figure 1) [specifically the type 1 (AT₁) receptor], involving G proteins and phospholipase C (Ganguly and Davis 1994). The binding of Ang II to the G-protein-coupled receptor results in increased cytoplasmic [Ca²⁺] (Johnson et al. 1988) and rapidly activates aldosterone biosynthesis. The action of Ang II appears to be limited to the zona glomerulosa (ZG), although it has been reported that AT₁ receptors are present in the zona fasciculata cells in some species (Viard et al. 1990). In rat zona fasciculata/reticularis cells, inositol phosphate levels are increased by Ang II (Whitley et al. 1987); however, because of the lack of inositol trisphosphate receptors in these cells (Szabadkai et al. 1996), steroidogenesis is not stimulated. There has been an accumulation of data showing the dissociation of aldosterone secretion from plasma Ang II levels, for example, in the human (Best et al. 1971), despite the usual excellent correlation. These important results obtained predominantly, but not exclusively, from studies in sheep cast doubts on the primacy of Ang II in regulating aldosterone during sodium deficiency and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere (Coghlan et al. 1971, Boon et al. 1996). Briefly, with Ang II levels “clamped” at a level normally seen in the sodium-replete sheep, it was shown that sodium depletion resulted in increased aldosterone secretion despite a lack of significant activation of the RAS (Blair-West et al. 1971b). Furthermore, Ang II failed to sustain aldosterone

Figure 1. Pathways of steroid biosynthesis in an adrenocortical cell showing the intracellular locations of the five steroidogenic enzymes: P450scc (cholesterol side-chain cleavage, cholesterol desmolase), P45017α (17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-desmolase), P45021 (21-hydroxylase), P45011β (11β-hydroxylase), P450aldo (aldosterone synthase) and 3βHSD (3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase). The substrate for steroid biosynthesis is cholesterol derived from low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The circled asterisk indicates the rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis, that is, the transport of cholesterol across the mitochondrial membranes by the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein. Stimulation effect of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) on the early pathway of steroidogenesis is mainly mediated by cAMP. Actions of angiotensin II (Ang II) are mainly mediated by phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis with release of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 stimulates release of calcium into cytoplasm from intracellular stores. Potassium ions are thought to depolarize the cell membrane, resulting in the activation of plasma membrane voltage-gated calcium channels; that is, both Ang II and K⁺ trigger the calcium messenger systems and raise cytosolic free calcium concentration to stimulate aldosterone secretion. The interrupted arrows refer to the transfer of steroids between organelles.

one secretion in sodium-replete sheep (Blair-West et al. 1962) or to increase aldosterone secretion in moderately sodium-deficient sheep (Blair-West et al. 1970, Scoggins et al. 1981). In a “turn-off” study (Blair-West et al. 1971a), when sodium status was returned from a depleted level to a normal level, the Ang II level did not fall commensurately or precede changes in aldosterone secretion, even though aldosterone secretion was considerably reduced. It has been demonstrated, also in the sodium-replete rat, during administration of glycyrrhizin or 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) (Kageyama et al. 1994), that it is difficult to

The dissociation suggested that another regulatory factor(s), which responds to sodium restriction in addition to Ang II and K⁺, is important in aldosterone secretion.

As alluded to earlier, the other major directly acting stimulus of aldosterone secretion is elevated extracellular potassium [K⁺] [refer to review by Müller (1988)]. Potassium ions are thought to depolarize the cell membrane, resulting in the activation of plasma-membrane voltage-gated calcium channels; that is, both Ang II and K⁺ trigger the calcium messenger systems and raise cytosolic free \([Ca^{2+}]\) to stimulate aldosterone secretion. It has been long known that Ang II and K⁺ interact with each other to regulate their steroidogenic effects, with the two agonists interacting to potentiate each other's steroidogenic effect both in vivo (Young et al. 1984) and in vitro (Tait and Tait 1976). We (Gogerly et al. 1993a and b) have proposed, however, a two-compartment model for the acute stimulation of aldosterone by Ang II and by K⁺ in sodium-replete conscious sheep with an adrenal autotransplant. Our model proposes that even though both secretagogues stimulate aldosterone secretion, acute stimulation by Ang II results in inhibition of the K⁺-stimulated pathway, reducing the adrenal to an Ang II-dependent model. This proposal has been confirmed in isolated rat adrenal ZG cells (Aptel et al. 1996).

Other physiological regulators of aldosterone secretion are ACTH and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). ACTH, the primary endocrine stimulus to cortisol (or corticosterone in the rat) secretion, is known to stimulate aldosterone secretion, but its effect is not sustained (McDougall et al. 1980), whereas ANP is an effective inhibitor of aldosterone secretion (Ganguly and Davis 1994). Müller (1988) has reviewed in extenso the reported effects of a number of other hormones on aldosterone secretion.

- **Aldosterone Biosynthesis**

Aldosterone is synthesized from cholesterol, as are the other adrenal steroids. The transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane is the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis (Jefcoate et al. 1987). Recently, the carrier protein responsible for this transport has been identified (King et al. 1995). This protein is referred to as the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein and is associated exclusively with the mitochondria [refer to review by Stocco and Clark (1997)]. Clark et al. (1995) have shown that Ang II and K⁺ induce the expression of the StAR protein.

The initial step of the “classic” aldosterone biosynthesis pathway [refer to review by Miller (1988)] (Figure 1) is the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, involving the P450scc (side-chain cleavage enzyme) in the mitochondria. Before pregnenolone can be processed further, it is transported from the inner mitochondrial membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum by a specific binding protein (Lee and Strott 1988). In the endoplasmic reticulum, pregnenolone is converted to progesterone by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (3βHSD), the only enzyme involved in adrenal steroidogenesis that is not a cytochrome P450 protein. The progesterone generated from pregnenolone by 3βHSD is hydroxylated by P450c21 (21-hydroxylase) in the microsomes to produce DOC. This product is transported back to the mitochondria for conversion to corticosterone (B), which is finally converted to aldosterone, probably via 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OH-B). An alternate pathway has been proposed for the late aldosterone biosynthesis reaction steps; that is, DOC is 18-hydroxylated to 18-OH-DOC before being 11β-hydroxylated to 18-OH-B (Vinson et al. 1991, Boon et al. 1996).

As noted previously, aldosterone is the most potent naturally occurring mineralocorticoid. Other biosynthetic intermediates, such as DOC, which has mineralocorticoid activity, or B, which has glucocorticoid activity, may make minor contributions to the physiological activities in normal subjects but assume greater importance in some adrenocortical disorders such as congenital adrenal cortical hyperplasia.

Aldosterone is produced exclusively in the ZG under the primary influence of the RAS, whereas the glucocorticoids (such as cortisol and B in the rat) and adrenal androgens are produced in the zonae fasciculata-reticularis (ZF/R) under the influence of ACTH.

Such zonation of adrenocortical function was based initially on morphological studies of the rat adrenal cortex; hypophysectomy of rats caused atrophy of the inner zones of the adrenal cortex, whereas the width of the ZG and electrolyte balance were not altered (Deane and Greep 1946). Later, it was demonstrated in vitro that aldosterone-synthesizing activity was restricted to the capsular layer of bovine adrenal glands (Ayres et al. 1956) and rat adrenal glands (Giroud et al. 1956), which contained predominantly the ZG cells, whereas the ZF/R cells exhibited no aldosterone production. Similar results were obtained in sheep adrenal tissue (McDougal 1975). Subsequent in vitro studies of mechanically separated ZG and ZF/R cells showed that, indeed, aldosterone-synthesizing activity is restricted to ZG cells in the bovine, porcine, and rat species (Tait et al. 1980, Ohnishi et al. 1988).

In the rat (Lauber and Müller 1989, Nonaka and Okamoto 1991), mouse (Domalik et al. 1991), hamster (LeHoux et al. 1994, Veronneau et al. 1996), and human (Kawamoto et al. 1990, Curnow et al. 1991), localized production of aldosterone and glucocorticoids can be ascribed to the differential expression of two distinct forms of cytochrome P450. The most abundant enzyme [which has retained the name P450c11β, although the recommended nomenclature is CYP11B1 (Nelson et al. (1996))] is encoded by the CYP11B1 gene and found in the ZF/R and cannot catalyze aldosterone synthesis owing to a lack of 18-oxidase activity. The other protein, designated cytochrome P450aldo, P450c18 or CYP11B2, is found exclusively in the ZG by immunohistochemistry (Ogishima et al. 1992) and hybridization histochemistry (Domalik et al. 1991, Pascoe et al. 1995) in rat, mouse, and human. As its name implies, P450aldo catalyzes the last three steps (11β-hydroxylation, 18-hydroxylation, and 18-oxidation) of the aldosterone biosynthesis pathway. This protein is encoded by a second gene, CYP11B2. In humans, this gene is located approximately 50 kb upstream of CYP11B1, on chromosome 8q22 (Mornet et al. 1989, Lifton et al. 1992a). The coding regions have 95% homology (Mornet et al. 1989). CYP11B2 mRNA levels are increased in cultured human ZG cells by physiological concentrations of Ang II (Curnow et al. 1991).

In the cow, five CYP11B genes (Kirita et al. 1990) have been identified, but only two cDNAs have been cloned, encodingthe two P450<sub>11β</sub> isozymes termed P450<sub>11β</sub>-2 and P450<sub>11β</sub>-3 (Nonaka et al. 1992). These differ by three amino acids. In expression studies, both enzymes possess the ability to catalyze aldosterone biosynthesis (Nonaka et al. 1992), and both are detected throughout the adrenal cortex by immunoblot analysis (Ogishima et al. 1989). Despite the distribution of the enzymes, the production of aldosterone in the cow has been shown to be restricted to the adrenal ZG (Ayres et al. 1956). The basis of an exclusive production of aldosterone in the ZG in the cow is still not understood. In the pig (Sun et al. 1995) and sheep (Boon et al. 1995), only one type of P450<sub>11β</sub> cDNA has been isolated. Both of the enzymes encoded by the porcine (Sun et al. 1995) and ovine (Boon et al. 1997) P450<sub>11β</sub> cDNAs were shown by expression in COS7 cells to catalyze the 11β-hydroxylation, 18-hydroxylation, and 18-oxidation of DOC to produce aldosterone. The mRNA encoding the ovine P450<sub>11β</sub> is detected throughout the adrenal cortex (Boon et al. 1997) by hybridization histochemistry, although aldosterone synthesis is restricted to the ZG (McDougal 1975). Thus, there are morphological and enzymatic activity differences in the control of aldosterone synthesis among species studied, and the basis of the functional zonation in the adrenal gland remains unresolved in a number of species. No explanation of this evolutionary divergence in the aldosterone biosynthetic pathway across species has been proposed to date.

Although two distinct P450<sub>11β</sub>-related enzymes have been isolated in rat, mouse, human, and hamster, with one involved in glucocorticoid synthesis and the other in aldosterone synthesis, the sequence or mechanism by which the multiple enzymatic reactions of aldosterone synthesis take place is still unclear.

a frequency of between 1 in 5000 to 1 in 15,000 births in most white populations. A deficiency of 21-hydroxylase (P450<sub>21</sub>) accounts for 90% to 95% of these cases, and classic 11β-hydroxylase deficiency accounts for 5% to 8% of cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (Zachmann et al. 1983). In classic 11β-hydroxylase deficiency, 11-deoxycortisol (S) is not converted to cortisol. Elevated levels of ACTH (the primary physiological stimulus of cortisol secretion) cause steroid precursors to accumulate proximal to the defective step. These accumulated precursors are shunted into androgen biosynthesis, resulting in masculinization of external genitalia in newborn females and premature appearance of secondary sexual characteristics in males. In addition, elevated DOC levels may cause hypertension and hypokalemia, as DOC and 19-nor-DOC have mineralocorticoid activity. This clinical feature distinguishes 11β-hydroxylase deficiency from 21-hydroxylase deficiency in which DOC synthesis is impaired [refer to review by White et al. (1987)].

The genetic basis of this disorder has been traced to a variety of mutations located in CYP11B1, the gene coding for P450<sub>11β</sub>. A single point mutation in exon 8 of the CYP11B1 gene was detected in Jews of Moroccan origin (White et al. 1991), resulting in the R448H substitution in the P450<sub>11β</sub> enzyme in most affected individuals. Subsequent expression studies demonstrated this mutation to abrogate the 11β-hydroxylase activity of the enzyme (Curnow et al. 1993). A total of 25 different mutations in the CYP11B1 gene have now been identified to cause 11β-hydroxylase deficiency (Helmberg et al. 1992, Curnow et al. 1993, Naiki et al. 1993, Yang et al. 1995, Nakagawa et al. 1995, Skinner et al. 1995, Geley et al. 1996). Ten result in premature termination of the coding sequence, being either nonsense mutations (K174X, Q338X, Q356X, W116X, W247X, Q356X) or frameshift mutations (DC32, insertion of 2 base pairs (bp) at codon 394, a 28-bp deletion in exon 2, and a 5-bp duplication in exon 2). Most of the 14 missense mutations identified (R448H, R448C, T318M, R374Q, R384Q, R384G, V441G, E371G, A331V, V129M, G267R, G267D, R427H, C494F) and the insertion of Leu at position 464 have been shown to destroy 11β-hydroxylase activity in vitro expression studies.

As the missense mutation R448H lies in

the heme-binding region of the enzyme (Figure 2), it is likely that this mutation interferes with the binding or the functioning of the heme group. The T318 residue is conserved in almost all members of the P450 superfamily and is believed to be involved specifically in the proton transfer event that cleaves molecular oxygen. The E371 and R374 residues lie in the putative substrate-binding region and are conserved in all cytochrome P450 enzymes. Similarly, the residues at positions 384 and 427 are arginines or histidines in all P450 enzymes and, thus, presumed to have structural importance. For example, R384 lies in a region with high probability for an α-helix formation and little probability of forming a β-sheet structure (Geley et al. 1995). The residues V129 and A331 are also highly conserved, but their functions are not known. Interestingly, those residues at positions 267, 441, and 494 are not highly conserved in the CYP11B subfamily. In summary, it is clear that classic 11β-hydroxylase deficiency is a result of mutations in the CYP11B1 gene that lead to the loss of the enzymatic functions of the P450<sub>11β</sub> enzyme.

Aldosterone Synthase Deficiency (Corticosterone Methyl Oxidase I and Corticosterone Methyl Oxidase II Deficiencies)

Two inborn errors of aldosterone biosynthesis, previously known as the type I and II corticosterone methyl oxidase deficiencies (CMO I and CMO II deficiencies), were reported by Ulick (1976). Characterization of the steroids secreted in these patients indicated that the biosynthetic defects lay in the last two steps of aldosterone synthesis. In both disorders, corticosterone of ZG origin is overproduced owing to stimulation by the upregulated RAS. The two defects differ biochemically in that 18-OH-B is deficient in CMO I deficiency but overproduced in CMO II deficiency. It was postulated that two types of enzymes catalyzed the terminal steps of aldosterone biosynthesis: CMO I was responsible for the 18-hydroxylation of B to form 18-OH-B, and CMO II was responsible for the 18-oxidation of 18-OH-B to produce aldosterone.

With the isolation of the human P450<sub>11β</sub> and P450<sub>aldo</sub> cDNAs, it is now clear that the overall conversion of DOC to aldosterone (comprising the steps 11β-hydroxylation, 18-hydroxylation, and 18-oxidation)

• Clinical Studies

Characterization of diseases caused by inherited defects in cortisol and aldosterone biosynthesis confirmed the hypothesis that in the human, P450<sub>11β</sub> is required for normal cortisol synthesis and P450<sub>aldo</sub> is required for aldosterone synthesis.

in the human is catalyzed by the single
enzyme, P450<sub>aldo</sub>. Consistent with this,
mutations have been identified in the cod-
ing regions of the CYP11B2 genes in
nearly all cases of CMO I and II deficien-
cies studied. Unexpectedly, however, mu-
tations causing CMO I deficiency resulted
in total loss of aldosterone synthase activ-
ity, rather than a block in 18-hydroxylase
activity. This was first demonstrated by
Mitsuuchi et al. (1993) when they detected
homozygous inheritance of a 5-bp dele-
tion in exon 1 of the CYP11B2 gene, result-
ing in a formation of a stop codon in the
same exon, in CMO I-deficient patients.
Since then, two other homozygous inher-
ited mutations of the CYP11B2 gene have
been identified: R384P (Geley et al. 1995)
and L461P (Nomoto et al. 1997). Expres-
sion studies of the human P450<sub>aldo</sub> cDNA
carrying these point mutations demon-
strated the encoded enzymes to be inac-
tive.

In CMO II deficiency, the first muta-
tions detected in the CYP11B2 gene result
in two substitutions: R181W and V386A in
P450<sub>aldo</sub>. In expression studies, these mu-
tations, together, resulted in the loss of
both 18-hydroxylase and 18-oxidase activ-
ities (Pascoe et al. 1992b), rather than a
simple loss of 18-oxidase activity as pre-
dicted by the clinical phenotype of an ele-
vated ratio of plasma 18-OH-B to aldoster-
one. No mutation was detected in the
CYP11B1 gene. When these mutations
were introduced individually into the hu-
man P450<sub>aldo</sub> cDNA, R181W reduced 18-
hydroxylase and abolished 18-oxidase ac-
tivities but left 11β-hydroxylase activity in-
tact, whereas V386A only slightly
impaired aldosterone production. All af-
fected individuals were homozygous for
both mutations, whereas eight subjects
with homozygous R181W mutation alone
and three others with homozygous V386A
alone were asymptomatic (Pascoe et al.
1992b). This finding suggests that a low
level of aldosterone is synthesized by the
R181W mutant despite not being detected
in the in vitro assay. Apparently, aldoster-
one synthesis is only sufficiently reduced
with the double mutants to result in a
clinical manifestation of disease.

Other complex mutations in the
CYP11B2 gene have been described in
CMO II deficiency: ΔC372 and R181W on
one allele, T318M and V386A on the other
allele (Zhang et al. 1995); a gene conver-
sion-like event in exons 3 and 4 (Fardella
et al. 1996) in one allele, with no mutation

- Glucocorticoid-
(or Dexamethasone-) Remediable
Aldosteronism

Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA), also known as familial hyperaldosteronism type I (FH I), glucocorticoid-suppressible hyperaldosteronism (GSH), or dexamethasone-suppressible hyperaldosteronism (DSH), is a rare disorder that is characterized by moderate hypersecretion of aldosterone, suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA), and rapid correction of these abnormalities after administration of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. It is a disease showing autosomal dominant inheritance.

In 1992, evidence for a chimeric CYP11B1/CYP11B2 gene was presented by Lifton et al. (1992b) in a kindred in which GRA was segregating. The genetic basis of the disease was proposed to be due to the fusion of 5' regulatory sequences of CYP11B1 to the coding region of CYP11B2, leading to an aberrant expression of aldosterone synthase in ZF, control of synthesis of these steroids by ACTH, and consequent glucocorticoid suppressibility. Subsequent studies (Pascoe et al. 1992a, Lifton et al. 1992a) identified the sites of the unequal crossing-over events, in different affected individuals, to occur between intron 2 and intron 4. The finding that the crossing over of the two genes always occurred before exon 5 implied that the aldosterone-synthesizing activity of human P450<sub>aldo</sub> was conferred by amino acids specific to CYP11B2 that are encoded in exons 5–9.

In a study in which a range of chimeric constructs containing the 5' ends of the human P450<sub>11β</sub> cDNA fused to the 3' ends of human P450<sub>aldo</sub> were expressed, Pascoe et al. (1992a) showed that cells transfected with hybrids containing the exons 1–4 of P450<sub>11β</sub> and exons 5–9 of P450<sub>aldo</sub> could synthesize aldosterone, but hybrids containing the first five or more exons of the human CYP11B1 and the rest of the exons from CYP11B2 could not synthesize detectable amounts of aldosterone. This study confirmed that exon 5 encoded residues essential for the additional enzymatic activities of P450<sub>aldo</sub>. This is not the case for the rat P450<sub>11β</sub> and P450<sub>aldo</sub>. In a similar expression study of chimeric rat

in the coding sequence of the second allele. The former study (Zhang et al. 1995) indicated that the biochemical phenotype in CMO II deficiency is determined by the least affected allele, although which activity was lost in expression studies of the T318M, V386A mutant was not formally demonstrated. The latter study (Fardella et al. 1996) showed that the "converted" enzyme has full aldosterone synthase activity. Hence, mutations in the promoters or other noncoding regions or in muta-

In short, the genetic basis of both CMO type I and II deficiencies has been traced to mutations in the CYP11B2 gene. In CMO I deficiency, the mutations result in complete loss of aldosterone synthase activity rather than loss of “CMO I” (18-hydroxylase) activity; in CMO II deficiency, 18-hydroxylase activity appears to be defective. As a consequence, it has been proposed (Pascoe and Curnow 1995, Ulick 1996) that CMO I deficiency be referred to

P450<sub>11β</sub> and P450<sub>aldo</sub>, Zhou et al. (1994) showed that the chimeric cDNA containing the first five exons of the rat CYP11B1 gene and last four exons of rat CYP11B2 encoded an enzyme retaining only the 11β-hydroxylase activity as for the equivalent human hybrid. Unexpectedly, the alternative hybrid protein (that is, the product of the chimeric cDNA containing the first five exons of rat CYP11B2 combined with the last four exons of rat CYP11B1) was inactive.

Curnow et al. (1997), by studying a series of chimeric cDNAs with segments of human P450<sub>aldo</sub> cDNA sequence replacing the human P450<sub>11β</sub> cDNA sequence, have subsequently reported that efficient 18-hydroxylase activity can be conferred on P450<sub>11β</sub> by a single amino acid substitution. The required amino acid is glycine at position 288 and is encoded by exon 5. All the enzymes with aldosterone synthesis activity have a glycine residue at position 288 (Figure 2). This residue is valine or serine in the non-aldosterone synthetic P450<sub>11β</sub>. An additional amino acid, alanine at position 320, is necessary for 18-oxidase activity. This residue is encoded by exon 6 of the CYP11B2 gene. Although alanine can be present at this position in the non-aldosterone producing P450<sub>11β</sub>, it is not found in combination with the G288 residue.

### Primary Aldosteronism

Primary aldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), a disorder associated with autonomous or inappropriate secretion of aldosterone, is the most common cause of potentially curable hypertension. In the 1960s, it was estimated that the incidence of primary aldosteronism was around 1% of the hypertensive population (Neville and Symington 1966), and this estimation became accepted widely. With the recent development of a more sensitive screening test [simultaneous measurement of plasma aldosterone (PA) and PRA by RIAs; elevation of PA/PRA ratio is an indication of primary aldosteronism], it was suggested that the incidence of primary aldosteronism is around 10% in the hypertensive population, 10 times higher than previously thought (Gordon et al. 1993 and 1994). This proposition has yet to be confirmed in other laboratories or centers.

Two-thirds of patients suffering from primary aldosteronism have an aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma,

and the majority of the remainder have hyperplasia of the ZG. Malignant adenoma was observed rarely in association with Conn’s syndrome (Neville and Symington 1966). Primary excess of aldosterone causes retention of Na<sup>+</sup> by the kidneys, expansion of extracellular fluid volume, low levels of renin in plasma, and systemic arterial hypertension with high peripheral vascular resistance (Schalekamp et al. 1981). Excessive glucocorticoid production is not detected in patients suffering from primary aldosteronism.

Gordon et al. (1991) reported a familial variety of primary aldosteronism, which they referred to as familial hyperaldosteronism type II (FH II). A total of 14 families have been diagnosed (R.D. Gordon et al. 1996). Unlike GRA (FH I), no similar readily detected genetic defect has been recognized to date, but there is evidence implicating the genetic lesion of multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN I), that is, the loss or inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes on chromosome 11q13 (R. Gordon et al. 1996).

Although there are still many details of the regulation of aldosterone secretion to be clarified (the mechanisms involved in turn-off and the change of sensitivity to angiotensin, to name but two), molecular studies and their contribution to the understanding of enzyme function have led to date to the determination of the genetic basis of four inherited diseases of aldosterone production. Cloning and expression of the cDNA encoding human P450<sub>aldo</sub> showed this enzyme to possess the ability to 11β-hydroxylate DOC to produce corticosterone, and to catalyze the further oxygenation of corticosterone by 18-hydroxylation and 18-oxidation to produce aldosterone. The search for the hypothetical CMO enzymes catalyzing those terminal steps of aldosterone synthesis was definitely completed when mutations causing CMO I and CMO II deficiencies were identified in the human CYP11B2 gene encoding P450<sub>aldo</sub>. Although P450<sub>aldo</sub> is expressed exclusively in the ZG in humans and rodents, homologous enzymes with aldosterone synthase activity are produced throughout the adrenal cortex in cattle and sheep. The mechanism limiting aldosterone synthesis to ZG in these species is not known but may have a bearing on the turn-off mechanism. In the human, the most significant advance of the past 5 years has been the resolution of the molecular genetic basis of GRA. This

was intellectually tidy and abolished the requirement of some hypothetical factors in aldosterone control. The genetic basis of Conn’s syndrome and FH II is still under investigation.
