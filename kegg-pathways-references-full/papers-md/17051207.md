**Prions and their partners in crime**

Byron Caughey¹ & Gerald S. Baron¹

Prions, the infectious agents of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), have defied full characterization for decades. The dogma has been that prions lack nucleic acids and are composed of a pathological, self-inducing form of the host's prion protein (PrP). Recent progress in propagating TSE infectivity in cell-free systems has effectively ruled out the involvement of foreign nucleic acids. However, host-derived nucleic acids or other non-PrP molecules seem to be crucial. Interactions between TSE-associated PrP and its normal counterpart are also pathologically important, so the physiological functions of normal PrP and how they might be corrupted by TSE infections have been the subject of recent research.

The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) first attracted widespread scientific attention almost half a century ago. The infectious agents responsible for TSEs were unusually hard to eliminate, and were more resistant to heat and radiation than any known pathogen. This led to heretical proposals that they might lack nucleic-acid genomes. The prototypical TSE disease was scrapie, a widespread infection of sheep that was known to persist in pastures for years after the removal of infected animals. Similarities between scrapie and human kuru, which was spread by cannibalistic feasts, contributed to a lurid fascination with these devastating and fatal neurodegenerative diseases. Since then, the impact of TSEs has been greatly amplified by the recognition of more common human forms such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), and epidemics of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and cervid chronic wasting disease (CWD).

TSEs (or prion diseases) are now defined by the transmission and involvement in neuropathogenesis of abnormal forms of prion protein (PrP) (reviewed in ref. 1). The normal form of PrP, PrP<sup>C</sup>, is a glycoprotein that is usually monomeric in structure, protease-sensitive, and linked to cellular membranes through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Box 1). Pathological forms of PrP vary and are poorly defined structurally, but are most commonly multimeric (aggregated) and more protease-resistant than PrP<sup>C</sup>. They have been given various names that emphasize associations with disease (for example, PrP<sup>TSE</sup> and PrP<sup>d</sup>), infectivity (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>), toxicity (PrP<sup>tox</sup> and PrP<sup>L</sup>) and relative protease-resistance (PrPres). Each of these terms has limitations. Here, we primarily use the term PrPres to refer to partly proteinase-K-resistant, TSE-associated forms of PrP, bearing in mind that most, but not all, types of TSE infectivity have been linked to such forms of PrP. The main difference between PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrPres seems to be conformational, with PrPres having a higher β-sheet content and being multimeric. These characteristics, as well as its ability to assemble into amyloid fibrils, make PrPres similar to the abnormal protein aggregates that are associated with other protein misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease (see page 774). However, a key and intriguing difference is that PrPres preparations are infectious.

Although researchers have been able to associate PrPres with TSE infectivity (prions), the full molecular nature of the TSE agent remains unclear. This is largely due to difficulties in purifying the infective agent so that its essential components and structures can be determined. A long-suspected and widely assumed proposition is that mammalian prions are comprised solely of PrPres, which propagates itself by inducing the conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrPres (ref. 1; Box 1). Nonetheless, definitive proof of this ‘protein-only’ prion hypothesis has been lacking. Years ago, PrPres preparations were shown to convert PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrPres with strain and species specificity<sup>1</sup>, indicating that PrPres has at least some capacity to self-propagate. However, the yield of these simple conversion reactions was limited, and the newly made PrPres was not proved to be infectious (ref. 2; G. Raymond and B.C., unpublished observations).

Considerable progress has recently been made in the cell-free propagation of PrPres and TSE infectivity, making it highly unlikely that this process relies on replication of a virus or foreign nucleic acid. Nonetheless, the data so far fall short of proving that the agent is composed solely of PrPres. Indeed, as detailed below, it seems likely that other molecules are crucial for prion propagation, either as components or cofactors in the conformational conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrPres. Furthermore, PrP<sup>C</sup> may be a key mediator of the neurotoxicity of PrPres, highlighting the importance of investigating how the normal functions of PrP<sup>C</sup> might be corrupted by TSE infection. In this review, we attempt to integrate these findings, with additional consideration given to common features of various anti-TSE compounds and how they might relate to the physiological ligands of PrP<sup>C</sup>.

### Unravelling TSE prion composition

The ultimate experiment to prove the nature of mammalian prions would be the synthesis of prions *in vitro* from defined constituents. Recently, three groups have come close to achieving this feat. One team showed that synthetic truncated PrP fibril preparations can induce TSE disease when inoculated into transgenic mice that vastly overexpress the same truncated PrP construct<sup>3,4</sup>. Although these results are tantalizing, the recombinant PrP fibril preparations<sup>3,4</sup> seem to be >10<sup>8</sup> times less efficient at instigating TSE disease than *bona fide* mouse scrapie infectivity when inoculated into wild-type mice. Moreover, crucial work to demonstrate that the transgenic assay mice were not already making prions spontaneously, as has been shown with transgenic mice overexpressing a different mutant PrP transgene<sup>5</sup>, remains to be reported. To further complicate matters, Nazor *et al.*<sup>6</sup> found that in similar transgenic mice inoculation of mutant-PrP aggregates from one transgenic mouse into others promotes the accumulation of pre-existing pathological forms of mutant PrP produced as a result of transgene overexpression. Accordingly, this process was more aptly characterized as acceleration of inherent disease rather than prion transmission — an important distinction in evaluating studies of *in vitro*-generated TSE prions.

Castilla *et al.* have demonstrated the cell-free propagation of PrPres and accompanying robust TSE infectivity, but many molecules besides

Box 1 | The cell biology of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies

As a GPI-anchored plasma-membrane glycoprotein (panel a), the PrP<sup>C</sup> polypeptide is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), processed in the Golgi apparatus and then carried, in its mature form, to the cell surface (panel b). PrP<sup>C</sup> is usually associated with detergent-resistant membrane subdomains known as rafts.

In cultured scrapie-infected cells, the generation of PrPres from PrP<sup>C</sup> occurs after the arrival of PrP<sup>C</sup> at the cell surface<sup>82,83</sup>. This conversion is directly induced by pre-existing PrPres and apparent cofactors through an ill-defined templating mechanism that results in PrP<sup>C</sup> joining the inducing PrPres oligomer or polymer. Important modulators of this conversion include sulphated GAG-containing proteoglycans such as HSPG (Box 2), raft membrane lipids<sup>84</sup> and LR/LRP<sup>16</sup>. The scrapie-associated conversion site for membrane-anchored wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup> seems to be on the cell surface and/or in endosomes that are drawn in from the cell surface<sup>82,83,85</sup>. However, PrP<sup>C</sup> released from the cell due to lack of a GPI anchor<sup>19</sup> may be converted to extracellular deposits such as amyloid fibrils and plaques (Fig. 1). In familial TSE-associated mutant PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules, spontaneous folding abnormalities can occur in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or the Golgi apparatus (for a review see ref. 30).

Misfolded PrP<sup>C</sup> can be subject to the ER-associated degradation pathway (ERAD; panel b). Under conditions of proteasome inhibition, cytoplasmic forms of PrP aggregates associated with neurotoxicity (such as PrP<sub>cyto</sub> and aggresomes) have also been described<sup>22,52</sup>, but the implications of these findings remain controversial. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which such aggregates are generated (for instance, the translocation of PrPres from the lumen of endocytic and lysosomal vesicles into cytosolic aggresomes, and the cause of proteasome inhibition) are unknown. The release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from chemokine-activated microglial cells<sup>26</sup> could contribute to ER stress and/or the ERAD process by inactivation of ER-chaperones<sup>86</sup> (for example, protein disulphide isomerase (PDI)

and GRP58), one of which has been shown to protect against prion neurotoxicity<sup>23</sup>. Excessive levels of misfolded proteins in the cytosol might impair proteasome function, either directly or after incorporation into aggresomes.

Once PrPres has been made, it can accumulate on the cell surface, in intracellular vesicles such as lysosomes or autophagosomes, or in extracellular deposits. PrPres and TSE infectivity can be released from cells in association with membrane-enclosed vesicles such as exosomes<sup>87</sup>. Uninfected neuronal cells can incorporate PrPres from the extracellular milieu by means of a mechanism that involves HSPG and LRP/LR<sup>10,11,58,59</sup>, distribute it along neuritic pathways, and initiate propagation of new PrPres<sup>72</sup>. Panel c shows a pseudo-coloured image of cultured neuronal cells to which fluorescently tagged scrapie PrPres (red) has been added. During the infection process, the cells have taken up PrPres particles into acidic vesicles and transported them along the neurites to points of contact with other cells<sup>72</sup>.

PrP were also present<sup>7</sup>. A cyclical conversion reaction (known as protein misfolding cyclic amplification; PMCA) was initiated by diluting scrapie-infected brain homogenate in normal brain homogenate (the latter provides the PrP<sup>C</sup> substrate and other potential cofactors for PrPres amplification). The products were further diluted in normal brain homogenates for subsequent serial amplification cycles. That the infective agent of TSEs can replicate in a cell-free environment greatly strengthens the argument against prions being a viral agent requiring amplification of an exogenous pathogen-derived genome. However, the complexity of brain homogenates makes it difficult to establish which host molecule or molecules comprise the infectious prion ‘unit’.

To begin to address this problem, Deleault *et al.* have shown that similar PrPres amplification can be supported using only PrPres, PrP<sup>C</sup> purified from brain samples, and polyanionic accessory molecules such as nucleic acids and heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG)<sup>8</sup>. This involvement of HSPG extends earlier observations that sulphated glycans can strongly influence (both positively and negatively) PrPres formation *in vitro*<sup>9</sup> (Box 2), co-localize with PrPres deposits *in vivo*, and serve as PrPres receptors on the surface of cells *in vitro*<sup>10,11</sup>. Perhaps endogenous polyanions could associate with synthetic PrP fibrils after inoculation to bolster infectivity levels. However, it is not yet clear whether infectivity is generated in any of the polyanion-stimulated conversions of purified PrP<sup>C</sup>.

In summary, none of the recent reports provide conclusive evidence that the infective TSE agent is composed of protein alone. On the contrary, it seems just as plausible to argue that other host-derived molecules besides PrP, particularly polyanionic polymers such as sulphated glycosaminoglycans<sup>9,12,13</sup> or host-derived nucleic acids<sup>8,14,15</sup>, might be required for robust TSE infectivity. Certain other proteins<sup>16</sup> also seem to be important, at least as cofactors in the conversion of normal PrP to pathological PrP in intact cells. Whether or not PrP molecules ultimately prove to be the only essential component for infectivity, the necessary conditions, cofactors, conformational changes and aggregation required for TSE-agent propagation *in vivo* remain to be determined.

**Box 2 | Anti-TSE compounds**

A variety of compounds have been identified that can inhibit PrPres formation in cell culture and promote survival in TSE-infected animals. These include cyclic tetrapyrroles<sup>88,89</sup>, sulphated glycans (for example, GAGs), sulphonated dyes and phosphorothioated oligonucleotides (PS-ONs)<sup>57</sup> (reviewed in ref. 90). The most effective examples can more than triple the survival times of rodents inoculated intraperitoneally with high scrapie titres (for example, \(10^3\)–\(10^4\) times the lethal dose) and completely protect animals receiving lower titres. Under experimental conditions, a few compounds have been shown to have beneficial effects after infection of the central nervous system (reviewed in refs 88, 90, 91), but none are known to be effective against TSEs in clinical settings.

Many known anti-TSE compounds bind directly to PrP<sup>C</sup> (and in some cases PrPres) and share a common structural feature in being (or having the capacity to assemble into) linear polyanionic chains<sup>92</sup>. This suggests that these compounds exert their inhibition by binding to PrP molecules at the same or overlapping sites. Indeed, competitive-binding studies have shown that sulphated glycans compete with Congo red, a sulphonated dye<sup>93</sup>, and PS-ONs<sup>57</sup> for binding to PrP<sup>C</sup>. Analyses of the sulphated-glycan-binding site on PrP<sup>C</sup> have produced evidence for the involvement of residues in three different segments of the amino-acid sequence: the highly cationic amino-terminal residues, the octapeptide repeats and a more carboxy-terminal site containing residues 110–128. There is still some debate as to which residues are most important<sup>94–96</sup>. The residues involved in binding different classes of anionic PrPres inhibitors may vary somewhat, depending on the size and specific nature of the particular inhibitor.

Regardless of the precise PrP-binding mechanism(s), one net effect of at least some of these inhibitors<sup>57,65,95</sup> is the clustering and internalization of PrPC from the cell surface (see panel **a**). This results in the sequestration of PrPC in a state and/or subcellular location that is incompatible with conversion to PrPres. Some inhibitors may also bind to PrPres in a way that interferes with its ability to convert PrPC.

Because several structurally different classes of PrPres inhibitors share certain properties, PrP-binding sites, and tendencies to cause PrP aggregation and endocytosis, one wonders how these phenomena might relate to the normal function of PrPC and the mechanism of conversion to PrPres. More specifically, it seems likely that these inhibitors bind to a site normally reserved for physiological ligands that influence the conversion to PrPres. Prime candidates for this type of ligand are GAGs such as heparan sulphate that bind to PrPC, associate with PrPres deposits *in vivo*, and support PrPres formation and internalization<sup>9–11,71</sup> (panel **b**). Many of the PrPres inhibitors discussed above can be viewed as GAG analogues or mimics. These compounds also mimic nucleic acids, which, like GAGs, are often linear polyanionic polymers with repeating anionic and hydrophobic surfaces.

Finally, strong inhibition by various cyclic tetrapyrroles raises the possibility that PrPC interacts normally with natural endogenous tetrapyrroles such as haemin. Crucial interactions with other cellular components such as laminin receptors<sup>60</sup> (Fig. 2) and membrane rafts might also be directly or indirectly affected by inhibitor binding.

**Minimal and most infectious units**

TSEs, like other neurodegenerative protein-misfolding diseases, generate various abnormal protein species, which range from non-fibrillar oligomers to large amyloid plaques. Questions abound as to which of these structures are the prime cause, or causes, of disease (see page 774). To better characterize the minimal infectious unit and the most infectious particles per unit protein, Silveira *et al.*<sup>17</sup> developed new methods for gently disaggregating scrapie prion aggregates in detergent and separating them by size using flow field-flow fractionation. With respect to PrP content, marked overlapping peaks were seen for both infectivity and cell-free PrP conversion activity with 17–27 nm diameter non-fibrillar particles of molecular mass 300–600 kDa. These activities were substantially lower in larger fibrillar aggregates, and almost absent from oligomers of ≤5 PrP molecules. Thus, under the experimental conditions, non-fibrillar particles with masses equivalent to between 14 and 28 PrP molecules were the most efficient initiators of TSE disease. These observations are consistent with an emerging theme for many protein misfolding diseases, that small-to-intermediate abnormal protein oligomers are more pathogenic than their larger fibrillar amyloid counterparts<sup>18</sup>. Although PrP seemed to be the main protein of the minimal and most infectious TSE particles, it is not yet clear whether other molecules or non-protein constituents of PrP might also be essential to infectivity.

---

**Post-translational modifications**

One clear difference between the highly infectious PrPres generated *in vitro* by PMCA reactions<sup>7</sup> and the purely synthetic recombinant PrP fibrils that have little or no infectivity<sup>3</sup> is the presence of natural post-translational modifications such as N-linked glycans and GPI anchors (Box 1) on the PMCA PrPres. These non-protein attachments should influence the shapes, stabilities, interactions and activities of PrP molecules, and might be expected to be crucial in the formation of PrPres and infectivity. However, they do not seem to be essential, because both PrPres and TSE infectivity can be amplified in transgenic mice expressing only ‘anchorless’ PrP<sup>C</sup>, which lacks a GPI anchor and is greatly underglycosylated<sup>19</sup>.

---

**A role for GPI anchors**

Although scrapie-infected anchorless-PrP transgenic mice propagate PrPres and infectivity, the lack of GPI-anchored PrP molecules changes the brain distribution of PrPres drastically and eliminates typical clinical TSE disease<sup>19</sup>. Instead of the predominantly non-amyloid deposits of PrPres seen in wild-type animals, the PrPres of anchorless PrP mice is restricted to large extracellular amyloid plaques (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the appearance and distribution of the neuropathological lesions that are associated with the anchorless PrPres amyloid differ from those seen in wild-type mice, with damage more prevalent in white matter than grey matter (B. Chesebro, personal communication). The lack of

accompanying clinical disease suggests that the lesions caused by anchorless PrPres amyloid are much less problematic than those caused by wild-type PrPres. Surprisingly, in mice that express both the anchorless PrP<sup>C</sup> and the GPI-anchored wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup>, the presence of anchorless PrP<sup>C</sup> accelerates, rather than delays, the onset of clinical disease. This observation suggests that GPI-anchored PrP is important in manifesting the clinically relevant pathological effects of extracellular PrPres. This is consistent with earlier studies that described reduced PrPres-induced neuropathology in brain tissue that lacks PrP<sup>C</sup> (refs 20, 21).

### Direct or indirect neurotoxic mechanisms

The involvement of GPI-anchored PrP in TSEs is consistent with both direct and indirect mechanisms of PrPres-associated TSE pathogenesis. One possibility is that PrPres is directly toxic to neurons<sup>22,23</sup> if produced within them in a GPI-anchored state (Box 1), but much less so if it accumulates extracellularly or in non-neuronal cells<sup>21</sup>. However, this does not always seem to be the case, because TSE disease can occur in transgenic mice that express PrP<sup>C</sup> only in astrocytes<sup>24,25</sup>. In addition, there is evidence that exogenous PrPres can induce the release of chemokines such as RANTES that recruit microglia<sup>26</sup>, which, in turn, could secrete neurotoxic factors (Box 1). A second possibility is that the most neurotoxic entity is not PrPres itself, but an intermediate in, or a labile byproduct of, the conversion pathway between PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrPres that must be generated in neuronal membranes to exert its effect<sup>18</sup>. A third possibility is that clinical disease is due primarily to the corruption or subversion of the normal functions of PrP<sup>C</sup> (ref. 27). Because transgenic PrP<sup>0/0</sup> mice, which either lack PrP altogether or have their PrP<sup>C</sup> expression turned off in adulthood, do not exhibit the symptoms of TSE disease<sup>20,28,29</sup>, it is unlikely that pathogenesis is simply due to a loss of PrP<sup>C</sup> function. Instead, there may be a toxic gain-of-function resulting not only from the presence of PrPres, but from its interactions with, or influence on, PrP<sup>C</sup>. Studies of transgenic mice expressing various mutant PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules have revealed that perturbations in the structure of PrP<sup>C</sup>, its expression levels and functions can cause neurological disease, even in the absence of TSE infection (reviewed in ref. 30). It follows, therefore, that the accumulation of PrPres might also cause disease by altering the metabolism or activities of PrP<sup>C</sup>. Thus, in the quest for TSE treatments, it may be important to understand the physiological interactions and functions of PrP<sup>C</sup> as well as PrPres.

it is puzzling, given the importance of many of the proposed functions of PrP, that PrP<sup>0/0</sup> mice have normal lifespans without obvious problems under standard laboratory conditions (reviewed in refs 28, 29). Although one line of PrP<sup>0/0</sup> mice exhibited clear-cut neurodegenerative disease, the phenotype proved to be due to ectopic expression of the PrP homologue, doppel, in the brain<sup>28</sup>. Most phenotypic changes reported in PrP<sup>0/0</sup> mice have been subtle, perhaps because of backup systems that can at least partly compensate for a lack of PrP<sup>C</sup>. Alterations have been reported in circadian rhythm<sup>39</sup>, hippocampal neuronal function<sup>40</sup>, spatial learning<sup>41</sup>, brain copper and cuproenzyme levels<sup>42</sup>, oxidative tissue damage<sup>43</sup>, phagocytosis and inflammatory response<sup>44</sup>, haematopoietic-stem-cell renewal<sup>45</sup>, neural-stem-cell differentiation<sup>46</sup> and stress responses<sup>47</sup>. However, some of these phenotypes have been disputed<sup>48,49</sup>. There have also been claims and counter-claims regarding the modulation of cellular apoptosis by PrP<sup>C</sup> (reviewed in ref. 31), the neurotoxicity of PrP peptides<sup>50,51</sup>, the retrograde transport of PrP<sup>C</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm as a key neurotoxic mechanism<sup>52,53</sup>, and the use of PrP<sup>C</sup> as a receptor by *Brucella* species of bacteria<sup>54,55</sup>.

### Common themes for PrP<sup>C</sup> functions

Faced with a bewildering array of observations about the functions of PrP<sup>C</sup>, it may be useful to consider which, if any, of its known activities might be applicable in the various cell types and physiological processes that are reputed to involve PrP<sup>C</sup>. Certain known PrP<sup>C</sup> ligands, such as neural cell-adhesion molecule (NCAM), seem to be specific to the nervous system and are not likely to be involved in the function of PrP<sup>C</sup> in non-neural cells such as leukocytes and haematopoietic stem cells.

PrP<sup>C</sup> could have other activities in both neural and non-neural cells. For instance, its binding to sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as those in HSPG, and extracellular-matrix proteins, such as laminins and laminin receptors, could be relevant under diverse circumstances because these molecules are widely expressed and serve various functions. In the case of neurons, such interactions might modulate cell adhesion, the homing of neurites, synapse formation and survival. In haematopoietic cells, analogous interactions might facilitate targeting of activated or newly differentiated cells to appropriate tissue sites where their services are needed. One example of this would be the alterations seen in zymosan-induced peritoneal leukocyte recruitment in PrP<sup>0/0</sup> mice compared with wild-type mice<sup>44</sup>.

The capacity of PrP<sup>C</sup> to bind and internalize Cu(II) and Zn(II) (reviewed in refs 33, 34) could also be of functional importance to many types of cell. Although the effect of PrP<sup>C</sup> expression on Cu(II) concentrations in the brain is debatable<sup>42,49</sup>, PrP<sup>C</sup> might still serve as a sensor, scavenger or transporter of these metals. Under typical physiological conditions, the affinity of PrP<sup>C</sup> for these metal ions is much lower than that of many other Cu(II)- and Zn(II)-binding proteins. However, this affinity can be enhanced by the presence of GAGs<sup>56</sup>.

The restructuring of cells and tissue components is another common feature of the physiological processes in which PrP<sup>C</sup> is involved. During

### Diverse ligands and potential functions of PrP<sup>C</sup>

Recent studies on the functions of PrP<sup>C</sup> suggest that its significance extends well beyond TSE diseases. PrP<sup>C</sup> expression is pronounced in neurons but also occurs in various other cell types (Table 1), and diverse activities and ligands have been described for PrP<sup>C</sup> (Fig. 2; Box 2; for reviews, see refs 31–34). Particularly notable is the abundant evidence that PrP<sup>C</sup> has a role in neuronal neurite<sup>35,36</sup> (axon<sup>37</sup> and dendrite) outgrowth and synapse<sup>38</sup> formation.

Despite many interesting revelations about various functions of PrP<sup>C</sup> in health and disease, the overall picture remains chaotic. For instance,

development, learning, cellular differentiation, responses to injury, infections and stresses, some structures are being built (Fig. 2) while others are being cleared away. PrP<sup>C</sup>’s associations with raft membranes, adhesion molecules and signalling pathways are consistent with its involvement in the assembly of new cellular structures such as neurites and synapses in neurons, and projections in leukocytes (pseudopodia) and follicular dendritic cells (dendritic processes). At the same time, there is evidence that PrP<sup>C</sup> negatively modulates the phagocytic activities of macrophages and other phagocytic cells in a manner that might control inflammatory responses to damaged or apoptotic cells<sup>44</sup>. Notably, PrP<sup>C</sup> is expressed at relatively high levels in the brain, where overly aggressive inflammatory responses might be particularly damaging and irreversible.

One curious characteristic of PrP<sup>C</sup> that is not obviously connected to the assembly of cellular structures but might be related to clearance or scavenging mechanisms is its propensity to bind metals, nucleic acids, porphyrins and their analogues (Box 2). The presence of free forms of these PrP<sup>C</sup> ligands in the extracellular spaces would ordinarily be unexpected, unless they were released from pathogens, dying or damaged cells, or perhaps debris from decommissioned cellular structures such as under-used axons, dendritic spines and synapses. The detection and control of potentially harmful factors is an important part of the responses of the innate immune system and glia to infections, tissue damage, stresses, developmental changes (such as apoptosis) and restructuring. It is tempting to speculate that PrP<sup>C</sup> might modulate such responses in various cell types by scavenging nucleic acids, metals, porphyrins and similar factors for delivery to appropriate receptors or subcellular sites for degradation and/or signalling. In this context, the binding of PrP<sup>C</sup> by cell-surface GAGs might keep PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules occupied until preferred ligands appear, because GAGs can compete for the same sites on PrP<sup>C</sup> (ref. 57).

### Complex formation by PrP<sup>C</sup>

Most of the known PrP<sup>C</sup> ligands — for example, NCAMs, laminins, laminin receptors and HSPGs — are involved in cellular adhesion, and these molecules, and their binding partners, are notorious for being polymorphic. Thus, one likely possibility is that PrP<sup>C</sup> functions as a part of complexes comprising multiple proteins<sup>32</sup> and membrane subdomains that are modulated by cell type, developmental stage, differentiation state, and both extracellular and intracellular cues (Fig. 2). Precise developmental and physiological control of expression of the different polymorphs allows their interactions with PrP<sup>C</sup> to be highly context-dependent and to have diverse functional consequences.

#### PrP<sup>C</sup> ligands affecting prion formation

The list of PrP<sup>C</sup>-binding molecules is long and growing, and it is important to determine whether these molecules also interact with PrPres, identify their respective interaction sites on PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrPres, and characterize the effects of these interactions on PrPres formation. Although the mechanism of PrP<sup>C</sup> conversion to PrPres remains to be fully explained, it is clear that specific direct binding between these two molecules precedes the conformational alterations that are associated with the acquisition of protease resistance<sup>1</sup>. Unlike most other amyloidogenic proteins and peptides, full-length PrP<sup>C</sup> has long been known to be refractory to continuous conversion into PrPres-like structures in most cell-free reactions. This contributed to the hypothesis that cofactors might be required for robust PrP<sup>C</sup> conversion to occur. Accessory molecules as varied as chaperones, metal ions, GAGs and lipids can all influence the aggregation of neurotoxic polypeptides. Landmark achievements have recently been made in this area with the identification of cofactors in the form of denaturants and polyanions, such as GAGs and nucleic acids (Box 2), which support indefinite propagation of abnormal PrP aggregates *in vitro*. Importantly, many of these — and related molecules — bind PrP<sup>C</sup>, and have been shown to either promote or inhibit PrPres formation both *in vivo* and *ex vivo* (Box 2). In this section, we discuss recent advances in characterizing the role of select PrP<sup>C</sup> ligands in the generation of PrPres.

#### Laminin receptor precursor

The discovery of a positive correlation between the 37-kDa/67-kDa laminin receptor and its precursor (LRP/LR) and PrPres levels suggested that

INSIGHT REVIEW

NATURE | Vol 443 | 19 October 2006

![Figure 2](#fig2)

**Figure 2 | Model of potential PrP<sup>C</sup> interactions associated with axonal growth.** PrP<sup>C</sup> seems to be important for neurite (nascent axon<sup>37</sup> and dendrite) growth and synapse formation<sup>38</sup> in neurons. Neurite outgrowth is modulated by PrP<sup>C</sup> interactions with NCAM and STI-1, which can lead to activation of intracellular signalling pathways<sup>35,36</sup>. In the case of NCAM, this signalling pathway is mediated by activation of Fyn kinase, presumably through receptor-type protein phosphatase-α (RPTPα). PrP<sup>C</sup> binds HSPG<sup>9–11,71</sup>, laminin<sup>74</sup> and the laminin receptor (LR) and its precursor (LRP)<sup>60</sup>, which, along with NCAM, are known to mediate contacts between neurons, other cells and the extracellular matrix. Various adhesion and extracellular-matrix molecules help to guide growing neurites to their appropriate destinations. These molecules are presumably delivered to the growing tips (growth cones) of neurites through transport vesicles, perhaps as preformed complexes<sup>32</sup>.

LRP/LR may participate in PrPres formation<sup>58</sup>. Subsequent experiments in scrapie-infected cell lines have established that LRP/LR is required for PrPres propagation. More recent studies have reported evidence for direct interactions between LRP/LR and PrPres in mediating binding of exogenous PrPres to enterocytes<sup>59</sup> and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells<sup>58</sup>, implying that LRP/LR has a role in the initial infection process. A recombinant secreted form of LRP/LR that lacked the transmembrane domain was shown to impair PrPres formation when expressed in scrapie-infected cells, providing a potential therapeutic strategy<sup>58</sup>. Interestingly, direct LRP/LR binding to PrP<sup>C</sup> maps to residues 144–179 on PrP<sup>C</sup> (ref. 60), overlapping a domain on PrP<sup>C</sup> that has been proposed to be involved in binding to PrPres<sup>1</sup>. This suggests that dissociation of LRP/LR from PrP<sup>C</sup>, perhaps after endocytosis, might be required to permit PrP<sup>C</sup> binding to PrPres. It seems likely that LRP/LR serves as a transporter or mediator during conversion, bringing together the two primary substrates for the reaction: PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrPres. It will be important to fully characterize the interactions between PrP<sup>C</sup>, PrPres, LRP/LR and laminin to determine whether perturbations of binding between these ligands contribute to TSE pathology. Development of LRP/LR knockdown transgenic mice will help to evaluate the role of this protein in prion pathogenesis<sup>61</sup>.

**Copper**

Copper induces the conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to protease-resistant, detergent-insoluble aggregates<sup>62,63</sup>, which raises the question of the influence of copper binding on PrPres formation. The effects of copper on PrPres are complex. Copper treatment inhibits PrPres formation in cell-culture models of prion infection and can delay the onset of disease in scrapie-infected hamsters<sup>64,65</sup>. Paradoxically, copper-chelation therapy also delayed the onset of scrapie in mice<sup>66</sup>. Copper loading can also enhance the protease resistance and recovery of infectivity from partly denatured PrPres preparations<sup>67,68</sup>. So how can these disparate observations be reconciled? The answer may have been provided by recent studies of cell-free systems of PrP<sup>C</sup> aggregation. Copper inhibited PrPres amplification in reactions using purified, brain-derived PrP<sup>C</sup> as a substrate and PrPres as a seed<sup>69</sup>. Similarly, spontaneous polymerization of recombinant PrP (rPrP) into amyloid fibrils was inhibited by copper treatment, which apparently stabilized non-amyloid, α-helical, proteinase-K-resistant rPrP aggregates<sup>70</sup>. Together, these observations might account at least in part for the inhibitory effects of copper on PrPres formation and prion infection. However, when added to pre-formed rPrP fibrils, copper induced coiling and enhanced proteinase K resistance and aggregation<sup>70</sup>. Although the conformation of rPrP in amyloid fibrils seems to differ from that of PrPres generated during prion infection, these observations may help to explain how copper assists regeneration of proteinase-K-resistant PrP in partly denatured PrPres preparations<sup>67,68</sup>. It remains to be determined whether copper-induced effects on PrP<sup>C</sup> trafficking (perhaps to a compartment incompatible with conversion, as depicted in Box 2) or conformation are solely responsible for its inhibitory effect on cellular PrPres formation, although these processes are likely to be interdependent.

**Glycosaminoglycans**

Sulphated GAGs, particularly those involving heparan sulphate, have long been implicated in interactions between PrPres and PrP<sup>C</sup> and TSE disease<sup>9</sup> (Box 2). In addition to participating in PrPres biosynthesis<sup>71</sup>, heparan sulphate was recently identified as a cell-surface receptor for prions<sup>10,11</sup>. Consistent with observations elsewhere<sup>72</sup>, binding efficiency was independent of host-cell PrP<sup>C</sup> expression level, which suggests that PrP<sup>C</sup> is not involved in the initial uptake of PrPres as proposed earlier<sup>73</sup>. As LRP/LR also binds heparan sulphate<sup>60</sup>, and because copper can participate in heparan sulphate binding to PrP<sup>C</sup> (ref. 56), it is possible that PrPres interaction with host cells might involve the formation of complexes with all three of the PrP<sup>C</sup> ligands highlighted in this section.

**Future directions in prion research**

Great strides are being made in prion research. As we have discussed, modifications of cell-free PrPres-amplification reactions now permit the perpetual formation of new PrPres, and the first robust cell-free generation of TSE infectivity<sup>7</sup>. Nevertheless, uncertainties still remain about the precise nature of prions. We are eagerly awaiting the results of infectivity studies on cell-free amplified PrPres derived from reactions using purified components<sup>8</sup>, which may unequivocally define the minimal ingredients necessary to generate infectious prions. However, these experiments will not, in themselves, provide critical information about how PrP<sup>C</sup> and other potential components become misfolded and assembled into prions. The application of powerful separation and biophysical analysis techniques, such as flow field-flow fractionation, light scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), to highly purified PrPres preparations should ultimately provide a complete molecular and biophysical picture of what constitutes the minimal infectious particle<sup>8,17</sup>. Such studies could also help to elucidate the mechanism(s) of neurotoxicity at work in prion diseases. The most toxic PrPres oligomers — and their mode of action — need to be identified, be it through direct or indirect (or both) effects on the functions of PrP<sup>C</sup>. An obvious requirement is an improved understanding of the physiologically relevant function(s) of PrP<sup>C</sup>. We hope that future research will answer these questions and promote the development of more effective TSE therapeutics (Box 2).

Although the issues listed above are of great importance, none of these address one of the most intriguing outstanding questions in the field of protein misfolding diseases: why are TSEs transmissible? There is a long list of diseases that are associated with polypeptides that can misfold into amyloid fibrils and other pathological oligomers, but the transmissible nature of TSEs under natural circumstances makes this class of diseases unique. In some cases, a lack of transmissibility might be attributable to intracellular localization of the amyloidogenic protein at a site at which cell-to-cell transfer is difficult. However, many amyloidogenic polypeptides are extracellular. One feature that clearly distinguishes PrP<sup>C</sup> from the other amyloidogenic polypeptides is its GPI anchor. This anchor could have numerous effects on the biochemical, biophysical and neurotoxic properties of PrP molecules<sup>19</sup>. For instance, GPI anchoring could help to maintain PrPres as a small, membrane-bound oligomeric species — with efficient spreading,

seeding and neurotoxic activities — as opposed to its forming large extracellular amyloid plaques (Fig. 1). Furthermore, there are cellular mechanisms that mediate the exchange of GPI-anchored proteins between cells, including secreted membrane vesicles (such as exosomes and microparticles) and transport via small intercellular projections known as tunnelling nanotubes. These exchange processes could provide a mechanism for the efficient spread of GPI-anchored-protein aggregates to new host cells to seed the formation of new protein aggregates<sup>73</sup>. It is noteworthy that although TSE infectivity is produced in mice expressing anchorless PrP, it seems to be transmissible only to mice with wild-type, GPI-anchored PrP, which can, in turn, make GPI-anchored PrPres<sup>19</sup>. Thus, it is possible that GPI anchoring is key to the unique transmissibility of TSE diseases.
