Oxytetracycline (OTC) is a 19-carbon polyketide antibiotic made by *Streptomyces rimosus*. The *otcC* gene encodes an anhydrotetra- cycle oxygenase that catalyzes a hydroxylation of the anthracy- cline structure at position C-6 after biosynthesis of the polyketide backbone is completed. A recombinant strain of *S. rimosus* that was disrupted in the genomic copy of *otcC* synthesized a novel C-17 polyketide. This result indicates that the absence of the *otcC* gene product significantly influences the ability of the OTC “minimal” polyketide synthase to make a polyketide product of the correct chain length. A mutant copy of *otcC* was made by site-directed mutagenesis of three essential glycine codons located within the putative NADPH-binding domain. The mutant gene was expressed in *Escherichia coli*, and biochemical analysis confirmed that the gene product was catalytically inactive. When the mutant gene replaced the ablated gene in the chromosome of *S. rimosus*, the ability to make a 19-carbon backbone was restored, indicating that OtcC is an essential partner in the quaternary structure of the syn- thase complex.

Oxytetracycline (OTC)⁴ and related tetracycline polyketide com- pounds are potent inhibitors of bacterial protein synthesis displaying broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-nega- tive pathogens. Although the clinical use of the tetracyclines has declined in recent years due to the emergence of resistance in these bacteria, OTC is still the first drug of choice for the treatment of intra- cellular infections caused by *Rickettsia*, *Chlamydia*, and mycoplasma in penicillin-sensitive patients incapable of tolerating macrolides (1). Gly- cylcyclines are a new class of semi-synthetic tetracycline derivatives that exemplify how modification of a known antibiotic can be a successful strategy to obtain new compounds effective against pan-drug-resistant strains (2). To this end we have been elucidating the biosynthetic path- way leading to OTC in the producing actinomycete *Streptomyces rimo- sus*, as a potential route to clinically useful OTC products by combina- torial biosynthesis (3).

Polyketide synthases (PKSs) catalyzing the formation of aromatic products such as OTC are dissociable enzyme complexes of largely monofunctional proteins that follow a mechanistic pathway similar to fatty acid biosynthesis (4). The synthesis of aromatic Type II polyketides usually begins with the condensation of an acetate unit derived from the decarboxylation of a malonyl-S-acyl carrier protein (ACP) to a malonyl- S-ACP extender unit. This reaction is catalyzed by a heterodimeric ketosynthase chain length factor (KSα-KSβ) (5, 6). Preference for non- acetate primers has also been recognized in a number of aromatic PKSs including OTC, although presumably decarboxylative chain initiation catalyzed by the heterodimer can still occur in the absence of these non-acetate starter units (7). Manipulating the mechanism of non-ace- tate priming has lead to biosynthesis of novel polyketides (8, 9). The active site of the KSα also catalyzes iterative elongation of the polyketide chain by a decarboxylative condensation of additional malonyl moieties. The malonyl-S-ACP intermediates are recruited following acyl transfer between malonyl-CoA and holo-ACP catalyzed by a malonyl-CoA:ACP acyl transferase; self-malonation of the ACP has been demonstrated also *in vitro* but is of limited physiological relevance *in vivo* (9–12). The crystal structure of a KSα-KSβ polymerase has recently been resolved and suggests that elongation occurs inside an amphipathic tunnel at the heterodimer interface followed by the first cyclization of the acyl chain (13).

Based on limited *in vivo* experimental evidence, the minimal number of enzymes required to form a polyketide of the requisite chain length was assumed originally to be the KSα-KSβ heterodimer and the ACP (14, 15). Further *in vitro* mutagenesis studies certainly implicate a level of control by the heterodimer over chain length (16). It is now recog- nized that disruption of genes encoding proteins upstream and down- stream of the “minimal” PKS can also mediate chain length control. These proteins, including ketoreductases (KR), aromatases (ARO), and cycloases (CYC), play essential catalytic roles in modifying the growing poly-β-oxo-intermediate and *in vivo* and *in vitro* evidence suggests that these proteins must also exert considerable structural integrity on the dissociable complex during polyketide biosynthesis (16, 17). To date there is no three-dimensional structure for an aromatic PKS complex,

strain M15883 (30). The *otcC* gene is a post-polyketide OTC biosynthetic gene whose product hydroxylates the tetracyclic nucleus at the C-6 position (anhydrotetracycline (ATC) oxygenase), many steps after the nascent polyketide chain has been synthesized and folded. The gene had been located by a “reverse genetics” approach, using a degenerate oligonucleotide designed against the amino-terminal peptide sequence of the purified enzyme protein (27) lying outside the transcription units of all genes involved in biosynthesis and folding of the OTC backbone, some 20 kb from the OTC “minimal” PKS (31). The combined results of transcriptional analysis (32) revealed co-transcription from the *otcCp1* promoter of *otcC*, *otcZ* encoding a biosynthetic methyltransferase (33), and the resistance gene *otrA*. During vegetative growth, *otrA* is also transcribed independently of *otcCp1* from its own promoter. In this paper, we present data on the disruption of the *otcC* gene and the influence of its post-polyketide gene product on the polyketide chain length.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—The OTC producer *S. rimosus* R6-500 (34) was used for the disruption of the *otcC* gene. The strain was maintained and grown in fermentation medium as described previously (35, 36). *Streptomyces* plasmid pPFZ46 (26) was used as a source of the *otcC* gene and flanking sequences. *Escherichia coli* plasmid pIBI24 (37) was used to construct a disrupted *otcC* gene by the insertion of the *gmr* gene, which confers resistance to gentamicin (38). *Streptomyces* plasmid pIJ486 (39), carrying the *tsr* gene, that confers resistance to thiostrepton, was used to construct a bifunctional vector capable of replication in *E. coli* and *Streptomyces*. All DNA manipulations were in *E. coli* strain TG1 (40). Plasmids were passed through *E. coli* GM31 (*dcm*) (41) to generate unmethylated DNA prior to transformation of *S. rimosus*.

General DNA Techniques—The general methods used for DNA manipulation in *Streptomyces* were described by Kieser et al. (42) and those in *E. coli* by Sambrook et al. (43). DNA was introduced into *S. rimosus* by electroporation, as described by Pigac and Schrempf (44).

Site-directed PCR Mutagenesis—Mutations in the *otcC* gene were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR (45) with the primers mp1 (5′-GCC GCC GCG ACC GCC CTG ATG CTC-3′) and mp2 (5′-GGC GGT CGG CGC GGC GGC GAT CA-3′) were used. The underlined nucleotides denote point mutations: G → C and C → G.

Two primers were used to amplify and clone the mutated *otcC* gene: forward, *otcCp1* (NH₂ terminus): 5′-AGC GCA TAT GCG GTA CGA CGT GGT GAT CGC-3′ and reverse, *otcCp2* (COOH terminus): 5′-TGG GAA GCT TCG GGC GCG GAA GGG CAG GGA-3′; thus the NH₂- and COOH-terminal regions were modified (in italics) by introducing NdeI and HindIII restriction sites (underlined).

A primer was designed to introduce an NdeI site at the beginning of the *otcC* gene: using Stratagene’s ExSite™ PCR site-directed mutagenesis system: mp3 (5′-CAT ATG GAT CCG AGG AGC GTG TAT GCG GTA-3′, NdeI site underlined) and a second, mp4 (5′-ATC AGT GGG TTG CCG CCG AGC ATG-3′). *Pfu* DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used to amplify the *otcC* gene.

Biochemical Methods—cell-free extracts of *E. coli* BL21(DE3) were prepared by sonic disruption of washed cell pellets. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using the procedure of Laemmli (46). The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated from the relative mobilities of standard proteins. Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie Blue binding assay (47), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The ATC oxygenase activity was determined as described previously (48, 49).

Isolation and Purification of Metabolites—The fermentation broths (2.0 liters) from *S. rimosus* R6-500 and recombinants ZGL1 and ZGL5 were saturated with NaH₂PO₄ and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 2 liters). The evaporated solid was fractionated by silica gel chromatography. Compound Cl-1 eluted on a methanol gradient (8–16%) in chloroform. It was purified further on a Sephadex LH-20 column (6% methanol:94% chloroform). Compound Cl-2 eluted from the silica gel in ethyl acetate (65–80% in *n*-hexane), while compound Cl-3 eluted in ethyl acetate (30–45%) in *n*-hexane. The extraction, concentration, and purification of polyketides were monitored by TLC on silica gel plates using chloroform/methanol/water (9:1:0.1) or acetonitrile/methanol/0.2 M oxalic acid (1:4:4) as mobile phases and by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on an Eclipse XDB-C8 column with gradient elution using acetonitril, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2.2) as the mobile phase. Commercially available OTC was used as a control in TLC and HPLC.

Structural Elucidation of Metabolites—The structures were resolved largely on the basis of two-dimensional homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR (400 MHz) studies using the COSY-45 technique for direct H-H coupling, the HMQC technique for 1-bond (¹J), H-C interactions, and the HMBC technique for 2-bond (²J) and 3-bond (³J) H-C interactions, as described previously (3).

RESULTS

Construction of an *otcC* Disruption Mutant in *S. rimosus*—The *otcC* gene was subcloned from pPFZ46 onto *E. coli* plasmid pIBI24. The gene was sequenced initially using a universal primer and then by gene “walking” using the derived sequence to specify the next primer. Sequencing of both strands used “Big-Dye” terminators on an ABI 373 DNA sequencer at the University of Strathclyde, by standard protocols. The annotated sequence has been deposited at GenBank™ with accession number AY916128.

To mark the *otcC* gene in *S. rimosus* and to replace it with a mutated copy, the gene was inactivated by insertion of a *gmr* marker that confers resistance to gentamicin. A bifunctional vector containing the *otcC* gene, pUC for replication in *E. coli*, and a thiostrepton-resistance gene (*tsr*) for selection in streptomycetes was constructed in two steps. First, both the 4.5-kb SphI₁₄-SacI₂₁ *S. rimosus* genomic fragment carrying the *otcC* gene with a XbaI linker (between KpnI₁₈-KpnI₁₉ sites) (Fig. 2) and a 1.6-kb XbaI fragment carrying the *gmr* marker were cloned to create pGLW74. Second, pGLW74 was linearized and ligated to the *Streptomyces* vector pIJ486 to create shuttle vector pGLW75. This construct, which was expected to result in insertional inactivation of the *otcC* gene in the host genome upon recombination, was introduced into *S. rimosus* R6-500. Many primary transformants that were resistant to thiostrepton (the vector marker) were obtained. These were propagated under non-selective conditions to eliminate the plasmid. After three rounds of subculture, the transformants were plated onto media containing gentamicin; more than 50% of the colonies were resistant to gentamicin. Chromosomal DNA was isolated from a representative number of thiostrepton-sensitive, gentamicin-resistant colonies and compared with DNA from the parental R6 strain. Southern blot hybridization confirmed that the *gmr* marker had been inserted into the target *otcC* gene through the expected double crossover (data not shown). A transformant designated ZGL1 was fermented to determine whether insertion of the *gmr* marker had led to inactivation of the *otcC* gene.

Characterization of Metabolites Produced by *S. rimosus* Mutant ZGL1—Preliminary TLC profiles of extracts from the fermentation broths of the *otcC*-disrupted strain *S. rimosus* ZGL1 did not contain OTC, but two products that were not detected in extracts from wild-type *S. rimosus* R6-500 could clearly be visualized. Further HPLC analysis revealed five potentially novel compounds (data not shown). Three of these compounds designated Cl-1, Cl-2, and Cl-3 were major metabolites that could be purified in sufficient quantities for structural determination. However, full structural determination of compounds Cl-2 and Cl-3 were not possible because of conflicting NMR assignments that warrant closer investigation beyond the scope of this present investigation. Moreover, the empirical formula of Cl-3 was C₁₉H₁₇NO₇ with a mass calculated to be 371.1005 (error 0.8 ppm) indicating that it might be a methyl derivative of Cl-1 formed during the isolation procedure. Although the remaining compounds were also purified, structural determination was not possible because of conflicting NMR assignments that warrant closer investigation beyond the scope of this present investigation.

The molecular formula of compound Cl-1 was established as C₁₈H₁₅NO₇ by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy data (observed monoisotopic mass *m/z* 358.0927 (M + H)⁺, calculated *m/z* 357.3228, error 3.9 ppm]. The structure of this compound was resolved by the analysis of various NMR experiments (¹H, ¹³C, and two-dimensional homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR studies using the COSY-45 technique for direct H-H coupling, the HMQC technique for 1-bond (¹J) H-C interactions, and the HMBC technique for 2-bond (²J) and 3-bond (³J) H-C interactions) (Fig. 3, A and B). The NMR assignments are given in TABLE ONE.

For compound Cl-1 the quaternary aliphatic carbon (δ 69.4) was coupled with two protons, H-1 and H-8, that belong to separate aromatic rings and with methyl protons (δ 1.51) suggesting that a methyl group is attached directly to it. Since the resonance was still low for a *sp*³ hybrid, it was concluded that it must also carry a hydroxyl group (δ 6.29). There were no correlations for a carbonyl carbon (δ 191.5) with any proton; this was assigned to the opposite site of the quaternary aliphatic carbon in the same ring of the anthroquinone.

primer otcCp1 introducing a NdeI site at the $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ terminus and primer otcCp2 containing a HindIII site at the COOH terminus. Amplification was achieved with 25 cycles of denaturation at $94^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $30 \mathrm{~s}$ followed by annealing at $55^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $30 \mathrm{~s}$ and by extension at $72^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $2 \mathrm{~min}$. The resulting 1.6-kb PstI${}_{17}$-SphI${}_{20}$ PCR product from each putative mutant was purified and analyzed using restriction enzyme NarI to identify mutant fragments. NarI digestion showed five fragments in the wild-type cells and four in the mutant cells, since one NarI site within the otcC coding region was lost as a result of replacement with the otcC mutant gene. This result confirmed that the otcC::gmr of strain ZGL1 had been replaced. Three positive PCR fragments (from recombinants named ZGL5.1, ZGL5.2, and ZGL5.3) were digested with NdeI and HindIII. The fragment was cloned directly and sequenced to reconfirm the desired alteration of the otcC sequence (data not shown).

Preliminary TLC profiles of extracts from the fermentation broths of S. rimosus strains ZGL5.1, ZGL5.2, and ZGL5.3 contained OTC as the major metabolite. Further HPLC analysis confirmed this by comparison of retention time and UV spectra against an OTC standard. There was no evidence for the production of compound C1-1 or any of the other major metabolites (data not shown).

Anhydrotetracycline Oxygenase Activity in E. coli—The activity of the wild-type otcC gene in cell-free preparations of E. coli BL21 DE3, quantified by conversion of anhydrotetracycline into 6-deoxycycline (49), was $11.2 \mathrm{nmol} \cdot \mathrm{min}^{-1} \cdot(\mathrm{mg}$ protein$)^{-1} \pm 0.16$ (five determinations). Background activity (reduction in $A_{440}$ in the absence of NADPH) was $4 \%$ of this value. E. coli recombinants of the mutant otcC gene, which had the essential glycine residues in the NADPH binding site mutated, had no net enzyme activity in this assay (limit of detection $<0.016 \mathrm{nmol} \cdot \mathrm{min}^{-1} \cdot(\mathrm{mg}$ protein$)^{-1}$ ), confirming that the mutations had the desired effect.

## DISCUSSION

ZGL1, a Strain Disrupted in otcC, Makes Novel Polyketides of Shorter Chain Length—The otcC gene encodes an anhydrotetracycline oxygenase that catalyzes hydroxylation at position C-6 during the biosynthesis of OTC in S. rimosus. Modification of existing antibiotics by combinatorial biosynthesis is a strategy that we wanted to evaluate as a route to new compounds with novel biological activity. To this end, the absence of otcC from the OTC cluster was expected to provide a biological route for production of doxycycline, which is currently made by a semi-synthetic route. A disrupted copy of otcC was constructed by introducing a gentamicin-resistance cassette into a restriction site within the coding region of otcC. The disrupted copy was exchanged for the wild-type copy located on the chromosome of the OTC production strain S. rimosus R6-500 by a double crossover event. Selection of stable integrants proved difficult, presumably because of the location of the OTC gene cluster within an amplifiable unit of DNA located close to one end of the linear chromosome predisposing this region to either DNA amplifications or deletions (34). One stable integrant, designated ZGL1, failed to produce OTC but instead synthesized at least five compounds absent from the wild-type strain. One of the compounds characterized was an anthracycline polyketide but was of shorter chain length than OTC. This implies that the absence of the otcC gene product has a very strong effect on the ability of the minimal OTC producing PKS to determine chain length. This is consistent with earlier predictions that auxiliary PKS subunits such as KRs, AROs, and CYCs can significantly modulate the intrinsic specificity of the minimal PKS with respect to both the folding pattern and the chain length of the final product. For example, analysis of a set of actinorhodin (act) and griseolin (gris) ARO/CYC-derived hybrid proteins expressed together with

been associated with in dimethylation of 4-amino-anhydrotetracycline, are close orthologs. Therefore, it is conceivable that the *otcZ* gene product could be involved in C-4 methylation. As insertional inactivation of *otcC* also likely affected the *otcZ* gene (which is normally co-transcribed with *otcC* as part of a polycistronic message; data not shown), and the ZGL1 mutant produces polyketides with a methyl group in the C-6 equivalent position, we now suggest a role of OtcZ in C-4 N-methylation. Careful disruption of the *otcZ* gene, without destroying the complex transcriptional pattern around this locus, is in progress to establish whether 6-demethyl-OTC will be made in the recombinant.

Restoration of a Structurally Intact but Catalytically Inactive OtcC Restores the Fidelity of the Polyketide Synthase—OtcC is a redox enzyme, with three essential glycines (GxGxxG) at the binding pocket. From this we postulated that OtcC is likely to have an active site located near the NH₂-terminal region and within the highly conserved flavin-nucleotide binding site. Since we predicted that glycine residues would play a role in hydroxylation activity of OtcC, these were altered by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis without altering the protein-reading frame. Expression of the mutant gene in *E. coli* showed that the protein was structurally intact but catalytically inactive. The mutant gene was used to replace the null mutation in ZGL1, creating ZGL5. The synthase, now in a recombinant that makes the OtcC structural protein, had regained its programming. Moreover the “6-hydroxyl” derivative was being made, but such adventitious hydroxylation of polyketide backbones by other hydroxylases in the cell is not unprecedented. The presence of the hydroxyl group at C-6 indicates that, in the absence of *otcC*, this reaction may be undertaken to some extent by other hydroxylases present in *S. rimosus*. In the initial cloning of the OTC gene cluster, the function of the *otcC* gene had to be validated by “reverse genetics” (27), as it was not possible to use a strategy that involved complementation. In hindsight, this is because of redundancy of functional specificity among some hydroxylases.

We have used cell-free extracts to investigate the activity of ATC oxygenase. Mutagenesis has shown that Gly⁹, Gly¹¹, and Gly¹⁴ residues play an essential role in the function of ATC oxygenase.

Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence, for the first time, that proteins with post-PKS modifying activities can also interact with the minimal PKS in a processive as well as a post-assembly manner.
