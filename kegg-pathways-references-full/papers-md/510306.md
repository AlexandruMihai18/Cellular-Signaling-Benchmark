(Received May 22/August 30, 1979)

A new enzyme, strictosidine synthase, which catalyzes the synthesis of 3-α(S)-strictosidine from tryptamine and secologanin was isolated from the soluble protein extract of *Catharanthus roseus* cell suspension cultures and was purified approximately 50-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation, column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Ultrogel AcA34 and isoelectric focusing. The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme was 34000. The pH optimum was 6.8, apparent \( K_{\mathrm{m}} \) values for tryptamine and secologanin were 2.3 mM and 3.4 mM respectively for the enzyme to synthesize strictosidine. Strictosidine synthase shows high substrate specificity. No apparent cofactor requirement could be demonstrated. Of several enzyme inhibitors tested, only *p*-chloromercuribenzoate inhibited the enzyme. The enzyme was relatively stable and could be stored at −20°C for periods of up to 1 year without appreciable loss of catalytic activity. The enzyme was demonstrated to occur in suspension cultures of 15 different species belonging to 9 different genera of the indole-alkaloid-producing subfamily Plumerioideae of the Apocynaceae family.

This enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of strictosidine the key intermediate in the formation of the majority of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids occurring in the plant kingdom.

The indole alkaloids, of which about 1200 are known to date [1], make up the largest class of alkaloids. They comprise such chemically diverse structures as ajmaline, gelsemine, quinine, strychnine, vinblastine etc. By feeding experiments *in vivo*, it was shown that most of the monoterpenoid alkaloids are formed through the condensation of the iridoid secologanin with tryptamine (reviewed [2]). Recently the key enzyme, catalyzing the stereospecific condensation of tryptamine with secologanin to yield the alkaloidal glucoside strictosidine with 3-α(S) configuration, was discovered [3–5] and some properties of the enzyme from crude extracts of cell cultures of alkaloid-producing Apocynaceae plants were preliminarily reported for the first time [6]. Strictosidine is the universal precursor for the multitude of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids both of the 3-α as well as of the 3-β series [7,8]. This enzyme catalyzes a Pictet-Spengler-type reaction between the aldehyde function of secologanin and the amino group of tryptamine as shown in Fig. 1. This cyclisation suggests a Schiff-base formation followed by an electrophilic attack of C-2 of the indole ring. During this attack the hydrogen atom of C-2 of the indole was eliminated, which formed the basis for a convenient and sensitive assay of this

enzyme using the ring \([2-{ }^{3} \mathrm{H}]\) tryptamine as substrate and analysing the \(\mathrm{HO}^{3} \mathrm{H}\) formed for radioactivity [6].

In extension of our previous work [6], we have now purified strictosidine synthase from *Catharanthus roseus* (= *Vinca rosea*) cell suspension cultures. This

plant is of considerable theoretical and economic importance [2], since it yields the hypotensive alkaloid ajmalicine, as well as serpentine and the antineoplastic alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine. Furthermore the distribution and some properties of this enzyme derived from several other cell cultures from plants of the subfamily Plumerioidea of the family Apocynaceae is reported herein. It is this new enzyme catalyzing the formation of strictosidine which opens the pathway for monoterpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis which eventually leads to some of the most complex low-molecular-weight compounds encountered in nature.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Plant Material

The cell cultures used were provided by our cell culture laboratory. Cell suspension cultures of Catharanthus roseus as well as the other Apocynaceae plants were propagated in the dark at 30°C on rotary shakers (100 rev./min) either in 1-l or 5-l conical flasks containing 250 ml or 2000 ml respectively of fully synthetic growth or alkaloid-production medium [9]. For larger amounts of tissue 30-l airlift fermenters containing the same medium were inoculated with 10% inoculum and aerated at 0.5 vol./min at 27°C. After about 2 weeks the tissue was harvested by filtration and immediately deep frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at –20°C for periods of up to one year.

Chromatographic Methods

Thin-layer chromatographic separations were usually performed on silica gel plates (Macherey, Nagel and Co, Düren) using the following solvent systems: (I) Me₂CO/petrol (b.p. 40–60°C)/NHEt₂ (2:7:1); (II) CHCl₃/MeOH/H₂O (65:35:10; organic layer); (III) Me₂CO:MeOH:NHEt₂ (7:1:1).

Buffers

The assays for the determination of the pH optimum were conducted in the presence of the following buffers in a final concentration of 0.1 M: citrate/phosphate (pH 3.0–7.0), potassium phosphate (pH 5.7–7.5) and borate (pH 7.7–8.7) buffer respectively.

Enzyme Assay

The assay procedure utilizes the elimination of the hydrogen atom at C-2 of the indole ring during the formation of strictosidine from tryptamine and secologanin. Using [2-³H]tryptamine as substrate this reaction can be measured by the method given in [6].

Strictosidine Synthase

The standard assay was performed as follows: 0.26 μmol (1.21 × 10⁶ dis./min) [2-³H]tryptamine was incubated with 0.8 μmol secologanin, 20 μmol phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), enzyme protein and water in a total volume of 0.2 ml. The temperature was kept at 35°C. Samples of 50 μl each were withdrawn after 45 min incubation time and the HO³H was recovered by sublimation for 90 min. The sublimation was conducted in duplicate using methods and apparatus as described in [10, 11]. To the frozen tritium-enriched water 10 ml Quickszint scintillation fluid (Koch-Light) were added and the samples counted for radioactivity. By this method 92.5 ± 6% of the HO³H formed by the strictosidine synthase reaction could be detected.

Stoichiometry of ³H Release and Strictosidine Formation

The stoichiometry of ³H release and strictosidine formation was determined by using [2′-¹⁴C, 2-³H]-tryptamine as substrate for the synthase. After the incubation, part of the reaction mixture was taken for HO³H determination by sublimation, the other part was chromatographed in solvent system III, the product (strictosidine) localized by scanning, was eluted with MeOH and its ¹⁴C activity determined and corrected for loss during chromatography.

Protein Determination

Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Folin method [12] using bovine serum albumin as a standard or by the spectrophotometric method.

Synthesis of [2-³H]Tryptamine

The synthesis of [2-³H]tryptamine was carried out by synthesizing [2-³H]indole first and converting this by standard procedures [13, 14] to tryptamine. [³H]-Indole was synthesized as follows: 6.2 mmol indole-2-carboxylic acid was dissolved in 5 ml absolute dioxane and 1 Ci HO³H (0.2 ml) was added. The mixture was allowed to stand for 24 h. Dioxane and HO³H were recovered by freeze-drying. To the residual indole-2-carboxylic acid, whose carboxyl proton had been largely exchanged for tritium, was added 40 mg CuO and 10 ml absolute quinoline. The mixture was refluxed under N₂ for 16 h to achieve decarboxylation [15]. The indole formed under these conditions was extracted into diethyl ether (200 ml). The ether layer was extracted with 150 ml 1 M NaOH to remove residual indole-2-carboxylic acid. Subsequently the organic phase was extracted with a total of 400 ml 1 M HCl to remove quinoline. The ether solution was dried over anhydrous Na₂SO₄, the solvent carefully evaporated and the indole sublimed *in vacuo*. Yield: 5.58 mmol indole (90%), spec. act. 13.8 mCi/mmol.

J. F. Treimer and M. H. Zenk

The labelled indole was transformed into indole-3-yl-glyoxyl chloride and subsequently into indole-3-yl-glyoxylamide according to standard procedures [13]. Indole-3-yl-glyoxylamide was reduced to tryptamine using LiAlH₄ [14]. The labelled tryptamine was finally purified using preparative layer chromatography (Sil gel, 0.25 mm) using solvent I.

The overall yield of tryptamine was 22% of the indole-2-carboxylic acid used; the specific activity was 5.9 Ci/mol, which was adjusted by dilution with unlabelled material to 2.1 Ci/mol. To prove the position of the label in the tryptamine thus formed, it was transformed into tetrahydroharman under physiologically mild conditions [16]. \[^3\text{H}]\)Tryptamine (280 μmol, 33.5 μCi) was reacted with acetaldehyde at pH 5.2 and tetrahydroharman (57% yield) isolated and recrystallized three times. m.p.: 179°C (lit. [16] 179–180°C); mass spectrometry: 186 (78, M⁺); 185 (20, M⁺ – H); 171 (100, M⁺ – CH₃); 157 (47, C₁₁H₁₁N).

Tetrahydroharman contained 17% tritium, which means that 83% of the label resided in the 2-position of the indole ring. The radioactivity removed from tryptamine was quantitatively found as water in the aqueous reaction mixture. \[^2'\text{-}^{14}\text{C}]\)Tryptamine bisucinate was from NEN (Dreieichenhain), and \[^7\text{-}^3\text{H}]\)-secologanin was prepared according to [8].

### Crude Protein Extracts

All of the following operations were carried out at 4°C. Cells of different plant species which have previously been frozen with liquid N₂ and subsequently been stored at –20°C were crushed in a cooled high-speed mill (Jahnke and Kunkel, Staufen, F.R.G.). To the cell powder was added an equal weight of polyvinylpyrrolidone wetted with the buffer given below and 1.5 vol. 0.1 M borate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 20 mM mercaptoethanol. The mixture was stirred for 20 min and the homogeneous suspension pressed through cheese-cloth. The filtrate was centrifuged at 48000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.

Solid \((\text{NH}_4)_2\text{SO}_4\) was slowly added to the soluble extract to give a concentration of 35% saturation. The precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation and a further addition of \((\text{NH}_4)_2\text{SO}_4\) was made to give a final saturation of 50%. After 15 min of equilibration the precipitated protein was centrifuged off as above and the sediment dissolved in 2 ml of 0.1 M KPO₄⁻ buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20 mM mercaptoethanol. The solution was stirred with Dowex 1X4 ion-exchange resin (100–200 mesh) equilibrated in the above borate buffer at a concentration of 0.5 g/20 g tissue. The resin was stirred for 10 min and filtered off. To the filtrate was added dextran-coated charcoal (25 mg/20 g tissue) and this mixture again was stirred for 10 min, during which period most low-molecular-weight substances were absorbed, leaving the protein in solution. The charcoal was finally centrifuged off and the supernatant used for enzyme determination.

#### Enzyme Purification from *C. roseus*

**Step 1.** 1 kg tissue of frozen stored *C. roseus* cells was crushed as above and extracted using, however, only the 0.3-fold weight of polyvinylpyrrolidone, and yielding about 2 l crude extract after filtration and centrifugation as above.

**Step 2.** To the supernatant of step 1 was added with stirring about 20 ml of 4 M acetic acid until the pH of the solution reached 4.0. The solution was stirred for a further 15 min and the precipitate formed removed through centrifugation (15 min at 14000 × g). The supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.0 by the addition of about 25 ml 4 M NH₄OH.

**Step 3.** Solid \((\text{NH}_4)_2\text{SO}_4\) was slowly added to the supernatant of the acid precipitation step and a 35–50% saturated fraction was prepared as above. The precipitate was taken up in 30 ml 0.1 M KPO₄⁻ buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20 mM mercaptoethanol. The solution was stirred with 20 g Dowex1X4 for 10 min and filtered through cotton. To the filtrate was added 500 mg dextran-coated charcoal, stirred for 10 min and the charcoal removed by centrifugation. The filtrate was then dialysed.

**Step 4.** The dialysed filtrate (39 ml) was loaded onto a DE-52 DEAE-cellulose column (1.5 × 10 cm) previously equilibrated with 0.1 M KPO₄⁻ buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20 mM mercaptoethanol. The column was washed with the same buffer until the wash buffer contained only traces of protein. Then 150 ml 60 mM KCl in the above buffer was added and non-enzyme-containing protein removed. Subsequently a linear gradient from 60 mM to 200 mM KCl in 250 ml of the above KPO₄⁻ buffer was applied at a flow rate of 70 ml/h. Fractions of 5 ml were collected and assayed for protein and enzyme activity. Enzyme-containing fractions (74–90) were pooled. The enzyme was eluted at about 120 mM KCl. The enzyme-containing fractions were concentrated to about 2.5 ml using a fiber ultrafiltration apparatus Berghof (Tübingen, F.R.G.) type BMU.

**Step 5.** To the concentrated enzyme solution (2.5 ml) was added glycerol (0.3 ml) and the mixture applied to an Ultrogel AcA34 column (1.5 × 36 cm). The column had previously been equilibrated with 10 mM KPO₄⁻ buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20 mM mercaptoethanol. The gel filtration was conducted using the same buffer at a rate of 24 ml/h. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and the enzyme-containing fractions (24–28) were dialysed against glycine (0.13 M).

**Step 6.** The dialysed fraction (8.5 ml) was subjected to isoelectric focusing using a type 8101 (120 ml)

column (LKB Instrument GmbH, Gräfelfing, F.R.G.) and Ampholine carrier ampholytes at a pH range from 4.0 to 6.0 were used. The focusing was performed for 45 h at 1000 V and \(0.5^\circ\)C. The column was finally emptied and 2-ml fractions collected. The enzyme peak was found at pH 4.4. The enzyme was contained in a total of 10 ml, which was used for the enzyme characterisation. In several determinations the isoelectric point of the enzyme was found to be at pH 4.4 at \(0.5^\circ\)C.

### Molecular Weight Determinations

The estimation of the molecular weight of the purified strictosidine synthase was carried out by gel filtration on a calibrated Sephadex G-100 superfine column. Although only the Stokes' radius of a protein can be determined by this method it is often used for the estimation of the molecular weight on the premise of a globular shape of the protein tested. The column \((2.4 \times 71 \, \text{cm})\) equilibrated with \(25 \, \text{mM} \, \text{KPO}_4^{-}\)buffer, pH 7.0, containing \(20 \, \text{mM}\) mercaptoethanol, was eluted at a rate of \(24 \, \text{ml/h}\). The eluates were collected in 2.0-ml fractions. The column was calibrated with globular proteins of known molecular weights: cytochrome \(c\) (12500), chymotrypsinogen A (25000), ovalbumin (45000) and bovine serum albumin (67000). Ferritin (450000) was used for the determination of the void volume of the column. The standards were monitored by their absorbance at \(280 \, \text{nm}\). The results are given as Stokes' radii. Calculation of molecular weights from these results is not possible as no sedimentation constants were determined. Nevertheless on the premises mentioned above the elution volumes and molecular weights were correlated as described by Andrews [17].

### Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis

In order to search for the existence of isoenzymes and to check the purity of the enzyme polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis was performed. The system used was a \(7.5\%\) polyacrylamide gel containing Tris-HCl, \(0.38 \, \text{M}\), pH 8.8, as buffer. The electrophoresis was conducted at \(4^\circ\)C and \(4 \, \text{mA/gel}\), using Tris/glycine \((0.02 \, \text{M})\), pH 8.3, as electrode buffer. The gels were sliced and the strictosidine synthase activity eluted in \(160 \, \mu\text{l} \, 1 \, \text{M} \, \text{KPO}_4^{-}\)buffer, pH 7.0, overnight at \(4^\circ\)C. The enzyme activity was measured by adding the substrates, incubation and sublimation of the aqueous phase as described above.

### Radioactivity Measurements

Distribution of radioactive material on thin-layer plates was determined by scanning using a Berthold (Wildbad, F.R.G.) radioscaner II. The determination

Strictosidine Synthase

of \({}^3\text{H}\) activity in the sublimed water dissolved in \(10 \, \text{ml}\) Quickszint 212 scintillation fluid (Koch-Light) and of \({}^{14}\text{C}\) activity was conducted in a Berthold Betaszint 5000 scintillation counter.

#### RESULTS

##### Stoichiometry of Reaction

The basis for the successful application of the test principle was the fact that \({}^3\text{H}\) of the \([2-{}^3\text{H}]\) tryptamine was removed during the enzymatically catalysed condensation with secologanin. Therefore the stoichiometry of the reaction had to be determined first. \([2'-{}^{14}\text{C}]\) Tryptamine and \([7-{}^3\text{H}]\) secologanin were incubated in a \(1:1\) molar ratio \((18 \, \text{nmol}; 0.99\) and \(1.17 \, \mu\text{Ci}\) respectively). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 45 min and the strictosidine formed was isolated. The glucoalkaloid showed on the basis of the \({}^3\text{H}/{}^{14}\text{C}\) ratio a \(1:1\) condensation of both reaction partners. Substitution of \([2-{}^3\text{H}]\) tryptamine for \([2'-{}^{14}\text{C}]\)-tryptamine showed, after correction for the \(17\%\) tritium atoms not being located at the 2-position of the indole ring, a stoichiometric formation of strictosidine and \(\text{HO}^3\text{H}\) release during the enzyme-catalyzed condensation.

##### Purification of Strictosidine Synthase

The enzyme under investigation was isolated from Catharanthus suspension cells by extracting cell powder

J. F. Treimer and M. H. Zenk

with borate buffer, pH 7.6. Partial purification was achieved by acid precipitation to remove inactive protein, ammonium sulfate fractionation (35–50% of saturation), DEAE-cellulose column chromatography at pH 7.0 with a linear gradient of KCl was successfully applied. The elution profile of the DEAE-cellulose column is shown in Fig.2. Desalting and molecular sieving on Ultrogel AcA34 and finally preparative isoelectric focusing (which was possible since the enzyme was relatively acid-stable under these conditions) yielded a purification of about 50-fold. The data for a typical purification procedure are summarized in Table 1. The protein solution at this stage did not contain glucosidase activity or any other enzyme activity involved in heteroyohimbine alkaloid formation, such as cathenamine reductase(s) etc. Disc gel electrophoresis of the enzyme at this stage of purification showed only traces of contaminating proteins.

**Enzyme Stability**

The purified enzyme was stable when frozen at –20°C. At this temperature the enzyme could be stored without loss of activity for periods of up to 12 months. Repeated thawing and freezing had only little effect on its catalytic activity.

**Properties of the Synthase**

**Effect of Substrate Concentration on Enzymic Reaction Rates.** Under conditions of the standard enzyme test no chemical condensation of secologanin and tryptamine could be observed. Thus the tritium set free by the enzymatically catalysed Pictet-Spengler reaction served as a convenient test. Under standard conditions the appearance of tritium in the ambient reaction water was linear for a period of up to 45 min using 6 μg of the 50-fold purified synthase. The reaction was absolutely dependent on protein and gave a typical saturation curve. The effect of tryptamine concentration on the activity of strictosidine synthase is shown in Fig.3. Double-reciprocal plots of the activity with respect to substrate concentration gave a linear relationship. The apparent \(K_m\) values were 2.3 mM for tryptamine and \(V\) 7.8 nmol/min. For secologanin as substrate an apparent \(K_m\) of 3.4 mM and a \(V\) of 3.3 nmol/min were determined under standard conditions. Tryptamine concentrations higher than 1.2 mM were clearly inhibitory to the enzyme reaction (substrate inhibition) an effect which was not observed using secologanin as substrate.

**Effect of pH and Temperature on the Enzyme Reaction.** The activity of the enzyme was measured at a range of pH values 3–9 in different buffers as shown in Fig.4. The synthase from Catharanthus shows a broad pH tolerance ranging from pH 8 to pH 4 with a clear optimum at 6.8. The enzyme exhibits a temperature optimum at 45°C. The Arrhenius plot shows an activation energy of approximately 71 800 J in the range 15–35°C.

**Aromatic Substrate Specificity.** The activity of strictosidine synthase was examined using a number

**Fig.2. Elution profile of strictosidine synthase activity from a DEAE-cellulose column.** The protein solution from step 3 of the purification procedure was dialyzed against 10 mM \(\mathrm{KPO}_4^{2-}\) buffer (pH 7.0) containing 20 mM mercaptoethanol and then applied to a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with the same buffer. The adsorbed proteins were first eluted with 60 mM KCl, then with a linear KCl gradient (---). Fractions (5.0 ml) were collected and analysed for their protein contents (\(\cdots\)) and the synthase activity (●—●)

**Monoterpenoid Substrate Specificity.** The partially purified enzyme proved to be very specific for the monoterpenoid substrate. Neither secologanic acid, iridodial, nor tarennoside was found to be substrates. Only 2′-O-methyl and 3′-O-methylsecologanin and dihydrosecolanin proved to be reactive. The reactivity was slightly less with 3′-O-methyl ($K_{\mathrm{m}} = 8 \times 10^{-3}$ M) and dihydrosecolanin ($K_{\mathrm{m}} 3.5 \times 10^{-3}$ M) as compared with secolanin ($K_{\mathrm{m}} = 3.4 \times 10^{-3}$ M).

**Effect of Potential Enzyme Inhibitors on Strictosidine Synthase.** The effects of different potential enzyme inhibitors on the reaction rates of the enzyme were examined. Of five –SH reagents tested only $p$-chloromercuribenzoate showed an appreciable inhibition (73%) of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at 1 mM concentration. Metal ions were tested at 10 mM concentrations but no inhibition was found using $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Co}^{2+}, \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}, \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}, \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ or $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$.

**Estimation of Stokes Radius.** Estimation of the Stokes radius of strictosidine synthase from *C. roseus* was carried out by measuring the elution volume on a calibrated Sephadex G-100 column using globular proteins of known Stokes radii as internal standards. The Stokes radius of the synthase was calculated from a plot of Stokes radii of marker proteins versus their relative migration distances in the gel. The calculated Stokes radius for the Catharanthus synthase was about 2.75 nm ± 3%. The relative migration distance of the enzyme can be correlated to that of a globular protein of a molecular weight of about 34000 ± 3%.

**Occurrence of Strictosidine Synthase in Different Plant Cell Cultures**

A number of cell cultures derived from indole-alkaloid-producing Apocynaceae and Rubiaceae plants as well as several non-indole-alkaloid-containing plant suspension cultures were surveyed for the presence of the synthase. The results are shown in Table 2. Enzyme activity was detected in all of the Apocynaceae cultures of the subfamily Plumerioideae. The specific activity and yield per volume of medium showed considerable variation within the different species. It should, however, be noted, that the cell cultures, with the exception of *C. roseus*, were not optimized either for alkaloid or for strictosidine synthase formation. This applied also for the Rubiaceae cell cultures of Guettarda and Mitragyna neither of which showed any formation of alkaloid and synthase in spite of the fact that the differentiated plants are a rich source of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids [18, 19]. Up to now, however, no attempt has been made to induce these cultures to alkaloid formation. The enzyme was also completely absent from those species which did not contain indole

of aromatic substrates as potential acceptors for the secolanin moiety. The assay was performed by incubating the enzyme with [7-³H]secolanin and the substrate in question at 1.5 mM concentration. After incubating the mixture for 180 and 360 min, an aliquot of the incubation was chromatographed and the plate scanned for glucoalkaloids formed. Using tryptamine as a control showing 100% activity, only 7-methyltryptamine (15%), 6-hydroxytryptamine (9%), 7-fluorotryptamine (8%), 5-fluorotryptamine (6%) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (4%) were found to be active. No reaction was found to occur with: 5-methyl and 5-methoxytryptamine, 5,6 or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, DL-$\alpha$-methyltryptamine, $N$-methyltryptamine, $\alpha$-ethyltryptamine as well as L or D-tryptophan. Also no reaction took place with

alkaloids in the differentiated stage (Galium, Nicotiana and Trifolium). Based on unit growth medium a considerable amount of strictosidine synthase can be obtained especially in the case of cell cultures of Rauwolfia, Catharanthus and Rhazya.

### Properties of Synthase from Different Plant Sources

Using crude enzyme extracts of eight plant species in cell cultures some properties of the strictosidine synthase were determined. The following species were examined: Amsonia salicifolia, Amsonia tabernaemontana, Catharanthus pusillus, Catharanthus roseus, Rauwolfia verticillata, Rauwolfia vomitoria, Rhazya orientalis and Voacanga africana. The Stokes' radius of the enzyme varied in the different species between 2.10–2.75 nm. The elution volumes can be correlated to those of globular proteins of molecular weights between 26000 and 34000. In none of the eight tissues was there any indication of the occurrence of iso-enzymes of strictosidine synthase. \(K_m\) values both for the substrates tryptamine and secologanin varied around an average value of \(3.5 \times 10^{-3}\) and \(3.6 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\) respectively. The optimal pH value for the catalysis of the reaction varied between 6.0 (Rhazya orientalis) and 6.9 (C. pusillus). Careful determination of the temperature optimum showed that in most of the cases \(45^\circ \text{C}\) was optimal, only Rauwolfia vomitoria, Rhazya and Voacanga showed an optimum at \(50^\circ \text{C}\). Using unpurified protein fractions from these different species the stereochemistry of the reaction product was determined. This was achieved by the incubation of \([2'-^{14} \text{C}]\)tryptamine with secologanin for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of unlabelled strictosidine and vincoside and the reaction mixtures subjected to thin-layer chromatography using solvent II.

Fig. 5. Nature of the reaction product of a crude enzyme preparation of Rhazya orientalis. The assay was conducted in a total volume of 0.1 ml. \([2'-^{14} \text{C}]\)tryptamine (80 nmol; 2.2 μCi) was incubated with 10 μmol KPO₄⁻ buffer, pH 7.0, 0.5 μmol secologanin and 45 pkat (59 μg) strictosidine synthase at \(35^\circ \text{C}\) for 45 min. The subsequent chromatographic procedures were performed as described. The scanning record of the second chromatography (solvent system III) is shown

Under these conditions strictosidine and vincoside have nearly the same \(R_F\) value. The band containing both glucoalkaloids was isolated and rechromatographed in solvent III. Under these slightly alkaline conditions, the 3-β epimer vincoside is transformed quantitatively into its lactam [4, 5], clearly separated from strictosidine which is absolutely stable under
these conditions. The plates were subsequently scanned and the radioactivity of the vincoside lactam and strictosidine zones determined. In all the cases tested only the 3-α(S) epimer of strictosidine was formed, there was absolutely no indication for any formation of the 3-β(R) epimer vincoside. The scanning record of a typical experiment using *Rhazya* tissue demonstrating the exclusive formation of strictosidine is shown in Fig. 5. Since non-purified crude protein extracts have been used in these experiments the possible existence of a vincoside synthase can therefore be excluded in these plants.

### DISCUSSION

Recent work in this laboratory [3–5] has demonstrated that, unlike previous findings [20, 21] it is not vincoside, with the 3-β(R) configuration, but rather its epimer 3-α(S)-strictosidine [22] that is the universal [7, 8] biosynthetic precursor for the vast majority of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. This result was made possible by using cell-free extracts of *C. roseus* cell suspension cultures which produced substantial amounts of indole alkaloids [9]. Under conditions of alkaloid biosynthesis *in vitro*, and in the presence of δ-D-glucono lactone, a specific glucosidase inhibitor, the condensation product of tryptamine and secologanin accumulated in the form of a glucoalkaloid which was rigorously proven to be 3-α(S)-strictosidine [3–5]. The enzyme catalyzing this reaction was named strictosidine synthase [4]. In a preliminary communication this novel enzyme was partly characterized introducing also a new assay for this type of synthase [6]. Use was made of the fact that, during a Pictet-Spengler-type condensation of tryptamine with the secoiridoid secologanin, the hydrogen atom at C-2 of the indole ring was removed, which appeared as water in the ambient aqueous enzyme incubation mixture. This assay, after the 1:1 stoichiometry of the condensation reaction had been established, allowed the partial purification and characterization of this enzyme, which was the object of the present study. The isolation and purification of strictosidine synthase from *C. roseus* suspension cells was successfully attempted. The enzyme at the final stage of purification was free of other detectable enzyme activities responsible for the formation of cathenamine or heteroyohimbine type alkaloids, using strictosidine as substrate. The purified enzyme did not show any dependence on cofactors (including pyridoxal phosphate).

The enzyme from *Catharanthus* and also from four other genera of the subfamily Plumerioideae did have a very similar molecular weight ranging, without exception, between 26000 and 34000. No evidence for the occurrence of isoenzymes of strictosidine synthase was found either by DEAE-cellulose chromatography

or disc gel electrophoreses (not shown). The enzymatic activity without exception resided in one fraction. The enzyme had a high degree of specificity for its substrates, which were transformed with similar $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ values into the product. Only secologanin and its closely related derivatives dihydrosecologanin, 2′-O-methyl and 3′-O-methylsecologanin showed activity as substrates. Neither secologanic acid (methyl ester group in secologanin removed) nor any of the other aldehydic intermediates tested showed activity in the enzymatic reaction. The enzyme had also high specificity towards the amine part. Tryptamine was by far the best substrate, but minor activity was also found with 5, 6 and 7 substituted tryptamines. For instance, 6-hydroxytryptamine was converted into the corresponding 9-hydroxystictosidine at about 10% of the rate of unsubstituted tryptamine. Vindoline, containing an 11-methoxy group in the aromatic ring is a prominent alkaloid in *C. roseus*, its formation via 9-hydroxystrictosidine is possible in the light of the above result. On the other hand strictosidine itself was incorporated into vindoline in good yield [4] which demonstrates that hydroxylation of the 9-position of the aromatic ring is possible even after the strictosidine stage. Since 6-hydroxytryptamine up to now has not been found in *C. roseus*, we assume that the hydroxylation of the indole occurs after strictosidine formation, which may also apply to the other position of substitution during alkaloid formation [1]. It is noteworthy that dopamine (as well as veratrylamine and others) is totally inactive as substrate for strictosidine synthase. This fact completely rules out the possibility that this enzyme takes part in the formation of desacetylipecoside and desacylisopecoside, the immediate precursor of the monoterpenoid ipecac alkaloids [23, 24]. Strictosidine synthase is also completely inactive with L-tryptophan, thus it has to be assumed that 5-α-carboxystrictosidine [25] and related compounds, which were found to co-occur with strictosidine in *Rhazya orientalis*, are not formed by catalytic action of this enzyme. For the formation of this metabolite a second enzyme catalysing the condensation of L-tryptophan [25] with secologanin has to be postulated. Since strictosidine synthase does not accept N-methyltryptamine as substrate, we cannot visualize the formation of dolichantoside (N-methylstrictosidine) [26] via a condensation of secologanin with N-methyltryptamine; rather this lack of enzymatic activity with the substituted tryptamine suggests a subsequent N-methylation of strictosidine during its course of biosynthesis. As in the other cases strictosidine should be formed as a primary metabolite in *Strychnos gossweileri.*

The enzyme strictosidine synthase has been found to occur in a number of different plant species [4, 6] belonging to the indole-alkaloid-containing family Apocynaceae. The properties of the synthase from

different plant material reported here gives the impression of a high degree of similarity of these enzymes in cell material of taxonomically different origin. Using crude extracts (which precludes the loss of enzyme activity during the purification process) of eight different species, the stereochemistry of the glucoside formed was investigated. In all these cases the epimer 3-α(S)-strictosidine was exclusively formed. There was no indication whatsoever for the enzymatic formation of the epimer 3-β(R)-vincozide. Numerous examples show that the synthesis of secondary metabolites in higher plants is under the same stringent enzymatic control as that for primary metabolites; therefore strictosidine synthase is responsible for the synthesis of the natural intermediate strictosidine only. On the basis of this and previous [3–5, 7, 8] results we are entitled now to assume that the previously reported natural occurrence of vincozide in Catharanthus roseus [20, 27] is either an error or a chemical artefact during feeding or work-up. The alkaloidal glucoside strictosidine isolated and characterized by G. N. Smith [22] is indeed the key intermediate in monoterpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis, as he had already assumed in 1968.

The novel enzyme strictosidine synthase discovered in this laboratory, which catalyses the formation of this key intermediate, will be a useful tool for the preparative-scale synthesis of the stereochemically pure biologically active epimer for further biosynthetic, biomimetic and enzymatic work.
