**ABSTRACT** An increasing number of reports underscore the frequent association of fibrosclerotic diseases of lung, liver, arterial wall, brain, etc., with the accumulation of oxidatively modified lipids and proteins. A cause-and-effect relationship has been proposed between cellular oxidative damage and increased fibrogenesis based on the fact that experimental treatment with antioxidants either prevents or quenches the fibrotic process. With some peculiarities in the different organs, fibrosisclerosis is essentially the result of the interaction of macrophages and extracellular matrix-producing cells. The cross-talk is mediated by fibrogenic cytokines, among which the most important appears to be transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). This report describes treatment of different types of macrophage, of both human and murine origin, with 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal (HNE) a major aldehyde end product of membrane lipid oxidation found consistently to induce both mRNA expression and synthesis of TGF-β1. Since increased HNE levels have been demonstrated in the cirrhotic liver and in the oxidatively modified low-density human lipoproteins associated with atherosclerosis, the up-regulation of macrophage TGF-β1 by HNE appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of these and similar diseases characterized by fibrosisclerosis.

AN EXCESS OF FREE RADICAL-MEDIATED OXIDATIVE reactions, a biochemical condition termed oxidative stress, is now recognized as potentially interfering with cell function and tissue homeostasis not merely through irreversible cell damage and deletion. The intense oxidative stress achievable only in experimental models exerts acute toxicity alone; conversely, more physiological degrees of oxidative unbalance can stimulate enzyme activity, gene expression, and even cell and tissue proliferation (1–3).

In particular, moderate oxidative damage has been reported to be associated with increased fibrogenesis in several different fibrosclerotic diseases, both in experimental animals and in humans (see ref 3 for a review). In other words, a large body of evidence suggests that the enhancement of membrane lipid peroxidation is able to trigger and sustain an inflammatory process in which cells of the macrophage lineage are known to interact with the extracellular matrix-producing cells with eventual expansion and degeneration of the fibrotic tissue component (3, 4). However, the biochemical reactions by which lipid peroxidation may modulate fibrogenesis are still to be elucidated.

We previously reported that CCl₄-induced stimulation of lipid peroxidation in the liver of chronically treated rats was paralleled by increased gene expression of the fibrogenic cytokine transforming growth β1 (TGF-β1)³ and of procollagen type I. Moreover,

dietary supplementation of the animals with the natural antioxidant α-tocopherol was able to prevent both enhancement of lipid peroxidation and gene up-regulation (5, 6). TGF-β is produced mainly by macrophages; it is a chemoattractant and growth factor for fibroblasts and fibroblast-like cells, and stimulates the synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix (4, 7).

In relation to the lipid peroxidation products involved in TGF-β overexpression, a great variety of aldehydes are produced after the decomposition of membrane lipid hydroperoxides (8–11). In particular, the most represented aldehyde of the hydroxyalkenal class, 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal (HNE), shows a wide spectrum of biochemical effects (12, 13) and can diffuse distant from the production site (14). Its steady-state level is increased in fibrosclerotic lesions of the liver, e.g., after chronic in vivo CCl₄ rat treatment (6), and its occurrence has also been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques (15, 16). In both cases it reaches at least micromolar concentrations (10⁻⁶–10⁻⁵ M). HNE concentrations in this range have been demonstrated to up-regulate the expression of procollagen type I gene, first in human cultivated Ito cells (17, 18) and then also in the liver of rats treated with CCl₄ (19). All of these considerations prompted us to investigate the effects of a single dose of externally added HNE at micromolar concentration (10 μM) on the expression and synthesis of TGF-β1 in different cells of the macrophage lineage.

### METHODS

#### Materials

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and RPMI-1640 medium, penicillin and streptomycin, L-glutamine, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, agarose, and formaldehyde were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.); newborn calf serum and fetal bovine serum, Life Technologies (Paisley, U.K.); the aldehydes 2,3-nonenal and nonanal, Aldrich (Milano, Italy); 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal was kindly provided by Prof. Esterbauer (Institute of Biochemistry, University of Graz, Austria); Ultraspec-RNA commercial kit, Biotecx Lab., Inc. Celbio (Milano, Italy); rapid-hyb buffer, multiprime DNA labeling system kit, and [α-³²P-CTP, Amersham (Milano, Italy); TGF-β1 kit, Predicta Human Cytokine Assays, Genzyme Diagnostics (Boston, Mass.); Pronase E, dodecyl sulfate sodium salt, acetonitrile, and acetic acid, Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); and collagenase type I, Biochrom (Berlin, Germany).

#### Cell lines and culture conditions

The murine macrophage line J774-Al and the human promonocyte cell line U937 (ATCC, Rockville, Md.) were cultured in DMEM and RPMI-1640, respectively, with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37°C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO₂ and 95% air. In both lines, the cells were dispensed at 1 million/ml. U937 cells were incubated in some

experiments with 150 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 24 h to induce the macrophage-like phenotype of adherence. Before treatment with the different aldehydes, the standard culture medium was removed and replaced with serum-free medium, which was left overnight. Cell viability was checked by trypan blue exclusion test during and after HNE treatment, and was above 95% at all times.

#### Animal treatment and Kupffer cell preparation

Female Wistar rats (Han-Wist) at an age of 3 months were used. The animals were housed under standardized conditions with dark-light cycle and were fed a standard laboratory chow diet (Altromin) and water ad libitum. Macronodular liver cirrhosis was obtained by treating rats with thioacetamide (TAA) added to the tap water at a concentration of 0.03% for 6 months. TAA was withdrawn 2 to 3 wk before the experiments to avoid acute side effects (20). Kupffer cells from cirrhotic rats were isolated by the method of Eyhorn (21) with slight modifications. Further, the macrophages were purified by elutriation (Beckman type JE-6 elutriator rotor). Kupffer cells recovered from elutriation were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in culture medium RPMI-1640 with 30% newborn calf serum and gentamycin. The cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 10⁶ cells/Petri capsule (60 mm). The viability of the final Kupffer cell suspension, checked by trypan blue exclusion test, was 99%. The purity of Kupffer cells was assessed by peroxidase activity and found to be above 90%. The cells were used after 48 h cultivation; 5 h before treatment with 10 μM HNE, the standard culture medium was removed and replaced with serum-free medium.

#### Aldehyde metabolism

Consumption of externally added aldehyde was monitored in U937 or J774-Al cells (1 × 10⁶ cells/ml) incubated in the presence of 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal or 2,3-nonenal, at a final concentration of 10 μM, at 37°C. In one series of experiments, 1 μM HNE was used. Aldehyde consumption was blocked at time points from zero up to 60 min by adding an equal volume of acetonitrile-acetic acid mixture (96:4 v/v) directly into the flasks. The residual aldehyde was monitored by a specific high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method (Waters Associates, Milford, Mass.) with a RP18-column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany); the mobile phases used were 42 and 72% acetonitrile for HNE and 2,3-nonenal detection, respectively.

#### RNA extraction and hybridization

For Northern blot determination of mRNA levels, total RNA was prepared from cells with an Ultraspec-RNA kit. After ethanol precipitation, RNA was dissolved in 10% SDS and the purity of preparation was assessed via A260/A280 ratio. RNA species were then separated by electrophoresis through a denaturing 2.2 M formaldehyde/1.2% agarose gel, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (20 μg) was transferred to a nylon membrane by capillary blotting; RNA was fixed by exposure to UV light and the membranes were stored dry until required. Both prehybridization (15 min at 65°C) and hybridization (2 h at 65°C) with ³²P-labeled TGF-β1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) cDNAs were carried out with rapid-hyb buffer. After hybridization, the membranes were washed to remove nonspecifically bound probe in 0.1 × SSC/0.1% SDS, exposed to Kodak XAR film with an intensifying screen at –80°C, and finally analyzed by densitometry.
For the densitometric quantification of TGF-β1 mRNA levels, the statistical significance of the difference between experimental groups was assessed by ANOVA associated with Bonferroni's test for paired samples. Data are means ± SD.

### Evaluation of TGF-β1 protein synthesis

The concentration of TGF-β1 protein was measured after 24 h incubation of cells (1×10⁶ cells/ml) in the presence of different aldehydes (HNE, 2,3-nonenal or nonanal) at a final concentration of 10 μM; controls were untreated. Determination was with an ELISA method using a commercial kit from Genzyme.

Student’s *t* test for paired data was used to determine the statistical differences in TGF-β1 synthesis between aldehyde-treated and control groups.

### RESULTS

#### Aldehyde metabolism by macrophage cell lines

After the addition of 10 μM HNE to cell incubation medium, the amount of aldehyde actually present during the first hour of incubation was monitored by HPLC; the results are reported in Fig. 1a. In both U937 and J774-A1 cultures, the HNE level had halved after only 10 min due to active cellular metabolism (8); after 60 min, one-tenth or less of the original amount was detectable. In subsequent experiments, 1 μM HNE (the amount that residues after 60 min treatment with 10 μM HNE) was externally added to other cell preparations. In this condition, U937 cells had a much higher HNE consumption than J774-A1

(Fig. 1b), presumably because they contained specific catabolic enzymes with greater substrate specificity.

#### HNE induced increase in TGF-β1 mRNA steady-state levels

A single addition of 10 μM HNE to human promonocyte cells (U937) in culture stimulated TGF-β1 gene expression measured in terms of steady-state levels of specific mRNA (Fig. 2); the increase was statistically significant between 30 and 60 min treatment. Overexpression of the fibrogenic cytokine was more pronounced when U937 cells were pretreated with 150 nM PMA to induce the macrophage-like phenotype (Fig. 3). Further, significant up-regulation of TGF-β1 mRNA levels was obtained when murine macrophages of the J774-A1 line were treated for 30, 60, and 90 min with 10 μM HNE (Fig. 4). In this case, cells treated with 1 μM HNE were also able to stimulate TGF-β1 gene expression (data not shown).

#### HNE-induced increase of TGF-β1 synthesis

The activation of the TGF-β1 gene by HNE observed in both human and murine cell lines produced an actual increase in the synthesis and secretion of TGF-β1 polypeptide in the culture medium, as tested 24 h from aldehyde addition (Fig. 5). The TGF-β1 gene product was also measured in cell cultures treated with the 2-alkenal and the alkanal corresponding to HNE, namely, 2,3-nonenal and nonanal; both compounds were without effect on TGF-β1 synthesis (Fig. 5). Consistent with this observation is our recent find-

TGF-β in cells of the macrophage lineage of murine or human origin. By using ³H-labeled HNE, the amount of radioactivity recovered in the total corpusculate cell fraction was constantly about 10% of the amount recovered in the cell suspension at the different incubation times (E. Chiarpotto, unpublished observations). In addition, if the relatively high and fast metabolic consumption of HNE and its par-

ing that an increased procollagen type I synthesis is induced in cultivated human Ito cells by HNE but not by 2,3-nonenal or nonanal (17). This different effect is probably dependent on the chemical structures; an updated explanation for this specificity might be the macrophage’s faster consumption of 2-alkenal than of 4-hydroxy-2-alkenal. In this connection, 10 μM 2,3-nonenal practically disappeared within 15 min from the addition to culture medium of either U937 or J774-A1 cells (Fig. 6). Corresponding analyses are lacking for nonanal, undetectable by HPLC.

HNE up-regulates TGF-β1 expression in Kupffer cells from cirrhotic liver

The possible extension of the observed up-regulation to other cells of the macrophage lineage would certainly strengthen the key role proposed for aldehyde products of membrane oxidation in promoting fibrogenic processes (3). We therefore tested Kupffer cells isolated from rats in which cirrhosis had been induced by chronic feeding with thioacetamide (18). The addition of 10 μM HNE to these cells triggers a strong cytokine overexpression after only 30 min treatment (Fig. 7).

DISCUSSION

This study indicates that the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal is a specific inducer of

tial reaction with cellular thiols and amino groups are considered, the effect described would appear to be due to the concentrations of aldehyde, well below 1 μM. The different intensities and kinetics of gene modulation observed in U937, J774-A1, and Kupffer cells should partly depend on cell origin, variations in aldehyde metabolism, and/or variations due to specific disease conditions, as in the case of cells from cirrhotic animals. The faster disposal of 2,3-nonenal than of HNE in both cell lines used is certainly one reason for its lack of effect on TGF-β expression, but it is probably not the only reason. Since the corresponding saturated aldehyde—i.e., nonanal—can react with amino groups but not with thiols, the reaction with –SH appears more important and the presence of the hydroxyl group in HNE may be essential in order to bind to neighboring thiols. A similar specificity has been found for HNE-induced expression of procollagen type I gene in human cultured Ito cells; there, too, 2,3-nonenal and nonanal were without effect (18).

Having obtained evidence of an increased steady-state level of TGF-β mRNA in HNE-treated macrophages, we evaluated aldehyde's effect on the transcriptional factor required for optimal activity of the TGF-β promoter, namely, activator protein 1 (AP-1) (22). As reported elsewhere in detail (23), addition of 10 μM HNE to either U937 or J774-A1 resulted in a significant increase of AP-1 binding to cellular DNA after only 15 min incubation, whereas 2,3-nonenal and nonanal were again without effect. Thus, 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal is able to up-regulate the transcription of AP-1-dependent genes such as TGF-β. Also, procollagen type I, whose transcription

UP-REGULATION OF TGF-β1 EXPRESSION BY 4-HYDROXY-2,3-NONENAL
factor α and interleukin 6, one may indirectly assume that the profibrogenic effect of 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal is specifically exerted through up-regulation of the major fibrogenic cytokine alone. This conclusion does not rule out the possibility that, of the variety of lipid peroxidation-derived molecules, some may be able to affect the other fibrogenic cytokines by increasing nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Acute intoxication of human THP-1 cells with CCl₄ has been shown to strongly activate NF-κB (24).

Thus, lipid peroxidation may indeed be involved in the deregulation of macrophage function occurring in organ diseases with sclerotic evolution. For instance, increased levels of HNE are detectable in human alcoholics before any biochemical signs of liver damage are present (25). Autoantibodies against HNE-modified low-density lipoproteins occur in human plasma and their titer correlates with carotid atherosclerosis (26). Recently, HNE has been detected in atherosclerotic plaques from human aorta (27). Through the stimulating effect of TGF-β (and other cytokines) on matrix accumulation, the initial injury is complicated and progresses toward sclerosis. Transforming growth factor β has been shown to exert both chemotaxis and activation of smooth muscle cells and fibroblast-like cells (3, 28). HNE-induced up-regulation of macrophage TGF-β1 expression gives the first explanation of how oxidative damage can lead to abnormal deposition of fibrotic tissue.
