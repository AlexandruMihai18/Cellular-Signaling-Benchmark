## Abstract

The mechanism involved in the cellular phosphate response of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* forms part of the PHO pathway, which upon expression allows a coordinated cellular response and adaptation to changes in availability of external phosphate. Although genetic studies and analyses of the *S. cerevisiae* genome have produced much information on the components of the PHO pathway, little is known about how cells sense the environmental phosphate level and the mechanistic regulation of phosphate acquisition. Recent studies emphasize different levels in phosphate sensing and signalling in response to external phosphate fluctuations. This review integrates all these findings into a model involving rapid and long-term effects of phosphate sensing and signalling in *S. cerevisiae*. The model describes in particular how yeast cells are able to adjust phosphate acquisition by integrating the status of the intracellular phosphate pools together with the extracellular phosphate concentration.

## Introduction

The metabolism of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is highly adaptable and allows cells to respond to changes in environmental factors such as nutrient status, pH and salinity. A rapid response and quick adaptation to such environmental stress is thus essential for cell survival. In *S. cerevisiae*, the mechanism involved in the cellular phosphate response forms part of a complex cascade pathway, the PHO pathway, a genetic regulatory circuit, which allows a coordinated cellular response and adaptation to changes in availability of external free phosphate (Pi) (Lenburg & O’Shea, 1996; Oshima, 1997; Persson *et al.*, 2003). The cellular adaptation to phosphate limitation and surplus conditions also requires that the prevailing phosphate concentration is ‘sensed’ by the cells. Although genetic studies and analyses of the *S. cerevisiae* genome have produced much information on the components of the PHO pathway, little is known about how cells sense the environmental Pi level and the mechanistic regulation of carrier-mediated Pi acquisition. Recently, Giots *et al.* (2003) have shown that addition of phosphate to severely phosphate-starved yeast cells activates the protein kinase A (PKA) signalling pathway. Although the mechanisms that induce PKA activity in response to Pi sensing and signalling have not yet been elucidated, these findings demonstrate existing molecular links between glucose- and phosphate-signalling pathways. This review will emphasize recent data obtained on phosphate sensing and signalling in yeast and attempt to provide a new model on how yeast adapts to environmental phosphate changes by both rapid and long-term responses.

## The PHO pathway is activated via intracellular phosphate sensing

The PHO pathway mediates the phosphate response by controlling the activity and localization of the transcription factor Pho4 through phosphorylation by the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex Pho80–Pho85 (Toh-e *et al.*, 1988). When cells are starved of phosphate, the CDK inhibitor Pho81 inactivates Pho80–Pho85, thereby allowing unphosphorylated Pho4 to associate with the nuclear import receptor Pse1 and to enter the nucleus to induce expression of several genes (Fig. 1; Vogel *et al.*, 1989; Kaffman *et al.*, 1994). Expression of genes coding for the high-affinity transport system (PHO84, PHO89), the secreted acid phosphatases (PHO5, PHO11, PHO12) and the corresponding proteins are increased so that the cell can better

Low Phosphate

Fig. 1. Low-phosphate sensing resulting in activation of the PHO pathway. When yeast cells are starved of phosphate, the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor Pho81 inactivates the Pho80–Pho85 complex. The transcription factor Pho4 is unphosphorylated and active, leading to the induction of PHO genes to scavenge phosphate from the environment.

scavenge phosphate from the surroundings (Lenburg & O’Shea, 1996; Oshima, 1997). High-capacity uptake of free phosphate from outside the cell under phosphate-limited growth conditions is mediated by the H⁺-coupled Pho84 cotransporter (Bun-ya et al., 1991). Expression of PHO84 is derepressed when the external phosphate concentration of the growth medium decreases to about 100 μM (Persson et al., 1999; Lagerstedt et al., 2002). A metabolic signal from inside the cell, regulating the phosphate homeostasis and the phosphate starvation responses, has been proposed (Wykoff & O’Shea, 2001; Auesukaree et al., 2004). Indeed, the disruption of PHO84 results in the constitutive expression of PHO5 (Bun-ya et al., 1991), suggesting that a defect in phosphate uptake in the Δpho84 strain may lead to a lower level of intracellular phosphate that mimics the effects of phosphate starvation and thereby serves as a signal for the PHO pathway. Moreover, the levels of intracellular Pᵢ and polyphosphate (polyP) strongly influence the regulation of the expression of PHO5, the main secreted acid phosphatase (Auesukaree et al., 2004). As an additional survival strategy, polyP is synthesized and accumulated mainly in the vacuole and represents a Pᵢ reserve used during periods of Pᵢ starvation (Kulaev, 1979; Kulaev & Vagabov, 1983; Kulaev & Kulakovskaya, 2000). Upon transfer of cells to a Pᵢ-deficient medium, a rapid decrease of polyP content is seen in whole cells and vacuoles (Kulaev et al., 1999). This mobilization of stored Pᵢ is accomplished by the concerted action of several different phosphatases (Oshima, 1997). Furthermore, a lowered capacity to synthesize polyP exerts control on the rate at which Pᵢ is taken up, possibly via a transient increase in the level of Pᵢ in the cytosol. The polyP thus plays a significant role in increasing the cell’s endurance to unfavorable environmental conditions and in regulating biochemical processes. The internal reserves of Pᵢ and polyP are apparently metabolized prior to the sensing of a reduced availability of external phosphate, suggesting that the disappearance of polyP is due to a short-term response to phosphate starvation (Pratt et al., 2004). The polyP pool also acts as a buffer that can be mobilized during periods of Pᵢ limitation and enables the phosphate-responsive signaling pathway to filter transient fluctuations in extracellular Pᵢ levels (Thomas & O’Shea, 2005). Recently, additional factors such as diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate and/or bis-diphosphoinositol triphosphate have been proposed to be involved in phosphate regulation, independently of the intracellular Pᵢ level (Auesukaree et al., 2005). All these findings strongly suggest that an intracellular phosphate sensor occurs to initiate the PHO pathway when cells are shifted from high-Pᵢ to low-Pᵢ growth conditions (Fig. 1), but the intracellular phosphate sensor at the molecular level has yet to be identified.

### A rapid phosphate signalling is responsible for Pho84 degradation

Synthesis and transport activity of Pho84 is maintained at its highest levels at a cell density corresponding to mid-exponential growth phase during logarithmic low-Pᵢ batch growth, a condition at which the extracellular phosphate concentration is in the range 30–40 μM. At lower phosphate concentrations the protein is removed from the plasma membrane and is subjected to vacuolar sorting and degradation (Lagerstedt et al., 2002; Persson et al., 2003). An enhanced degradation of the Pho84 transporter is also observed within 60 min when repressive amounts of phosphate (10 mM) are added to low-Pᵢ-grown cells (Fig. 2; Lagerstedt et al., 2002; Pratt et al., 2004). Removal of the Pho84 transporter in response to external Pᵢ elevation occurs in a concentration-dependent manner with respect to Pᵢ, as evidenced by the fact that lower concentrations of added Pᵢ (0.1 and 1 mM) do not affect the stability of the transporter (Pratt et al., 2004). Down-regulation and degradation of Pho84 are also triggered by the use of the nonmetabolized phosphate analogue methylphosphonate (MP), when added at a concentration of 10 mM to low-Pᵢ-grown cells (Pratt et al., 2004). MP appears to be recognized as a Pho84 substrate and to convey a true phosphate-like response at the level of Pho84 protein expression and degradation. The usefulness of MP to dissect the phosphate signalling and expression of the PHO genes is further emphasized by the fact that de-repression of the PHO84 gene is unperturbed when MP is present in the culture media during low-phosphate growth conditions (Pratt et al., 2004). By contrast, no major accumulation of Pho84 in the

The addition of phosphate to low-phosphate-grown cells triggers activation of PKA through phosphate recognition by Pho84 and/or Pho87. Activation of the PKA pathway leads to an enhanced degradation of the high-affinity phosphate transporter Pho84 in the vacuole.

activation is cAMP-independent and does not require the Sch9 protein kinase (Giots et al., 2003). Activation of PKA seems to be essential for Pho84 down-regulation and degradation, as inhibition of PKA activity strongly alters the removal of Pho84 from the plasma membrane in response to external Pi elevation (Mouillon & Persson, 2005). By contrast, down-regulation of the secreted acid phosphatases does not require activation of the PKA signaling pathway and occurs 120 min after addition of Pi to low-Pi-grown cells (Mouillon & Persson, 2005). Together, these findings suggest that Pho84 is part of the phosphate sensor machinery involved in the cellular response to changes of phosphate concentration in the external media (Fig. 2). The use of plasma membrane-based nutrient sensing systems for rapid activation of the PKA pathway has been described for other nutrient sensing mechanisms such as for glucose, sucrose and amino acids (Thevelein et al., 2005). These authors suggested that the rapid activation of the PKA pathway in nutrient-starved cells might be due to the short-term nature of the starvation response. Stress signaling involving both rapid and long-term responses has been described for the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) system, which is activated by a large variety of cellular stresses that deplete ATP. Activation of AMPK switches on alternative catabolic pathways that generate ATP while switching off ATP consumption via both a rapid (direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes) and more long-term effects on gene and protein expression (Kahn et al., 2005).

Long-term effects of phosphate sensing and signalling on gene and protein expression

Under conditions of high phosphate, the Pho80–Pho85 complex phosphorylates and inactivates the transcription factor Pho4 by triggering the association of phosphorylated Pho4 with the nuclear export receptor Msn5. This association leads to the rapid export of Pho4 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and thus to repression of PHO genes (Fig. 3). Down-regulation of the secreted acid phosphatases does not involve the PKA signaling pathway (Mouillon & Persson, 2005) and seems to occur via repression of the PHO pathway when intracellular phosphate reserves have been replenished (Auesukaree et al., 2004). Previous studies also question the role of the high-affinity transport system in the signaling to repress the secreted acid phosphatases (Lau et al., 1998). These authors suggest a model to explain the constitutive expression of secreted acid phosphatases in Δpho84 or Δpho86 mutants, where defects in phosphate uptake might result in a low level of intracellular Pi that serves as a signal. Recent findings have also demonstrated a direct correlation between intracellular Pi and polyP pools on repression of the

major factor controlling expression and activity of the Pho84 transporter (Martinez *et al.*, 1998; Petersson *et al.*, 1999; Pratt *et al.*, 2004), whereas limitation in the carbon source results in rapid degradation of the transporter even in the presence of de-repressing levels of P<sub>i</sub> (Martinez *et al.*, 1998). The physiological regulation of Pho84 seems to depend on the availability of both de-repressing P<sub>i</sub> concentrations and an abundant carbon source. The presence of glucose is also required during phosphate signalling for PKA activation (Giots *et al.*, 2003). The authors suggest that glucose is in fact needed to maintain PKA in an active state, as inactivation of both the G-protein-coupled receptor system and the glucose-phosphorylation-dependent system reduces the cAMP level to such an extent that PKA activity is insufficient to sustain phosphate signalling (Giots *et al.*, 2003). Furthermore, rapid phosphate activation is not prevented by complete inhibition of glycolysis, suggesting a metabolism-independent process (Giots *et al.*, 2003). Whether Pho84, like many other plasma membrane proteins in yeast, is phosphorylated and/or ubiquitinated prior to endocytosis and vacuolar processing is so far unknown. Primary sequence analysis of Pho84 shows that 12 lysine residues, the target for ubiquitination, are predicted to be cytoplasmically located, according to existing two- and three-dimensional models (Lagerstedt *et al.*, 2004). It remains to be seen whether these residues are functionally important for ubiquitination/endocytosis. The Pho84 protein also contains a C-terminal sequence similar to the amino acid sequence SINNDAKSS of the C-terminal region of the membrane-bound Ste2 α-factor pheromone receptor, serving as the target site for ubiquitination and phosphorylation preceding endocytosis (Hicke *et al.*, 1998). However, C-terminal substitution and deletion mutagenesis of both green fluorescent protein- and C-MYC-epitope (EQKLISEEDL) tagged Pho84 proteins, followed by analysis of the localization and function of the transporter, did not reveal any alteration in the degradation pattern (Lagerstedt *et al.*, 2002). What is the physiological role of a rapid removal and degradation of Pho84 from the plasma membrane in response to external P<sub>i</sub> elevation? One explanation may be to avoid an excess uptake of P<sub>i</sub> into the cell. Indeed, a major uptake of P<sub>i</sub> into the cell could have dramatic consequences that strongly affect the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane generated by H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases. Previous studies of intact yeast cells (Bun-ya *et al.*, 1991; Martinez *et al.*, 1998) and inverted plasma membrane vesicles (Frisdt *et al.*, 1996) have shown that the Pho84 transporter catalyses a bi-directional H<sup>+</sup>-coupled P<sub>i</sub> uptake, where the direction of transport is determined by the directionality of the driving force rather than by the orientation of the protein. Moreover, the presence of the constitutively expressed low-affinity phosphate transport system (Pho87, Pho90 and Pho91) also allows P<sub>i</sub> uptake when repressive

secreted acid phosphatases (Auesukaree *et al.*, 2004). Our model also favours the idea that an intracellular P<sub>i</sub> signal rather than a phosphate carrier acting as a sensor is responsible for the down-regulation of the secreted acid phosphatases (Fig. 3). The CDK inhibitor Pho81 has been proposed as the intracellular sensor because of its regulatory activity in the PHO pathway and the fact that a minimal domain of Pho81 containing 80 amino acids is both necessary and sufficient to inhibit Pho80–Pho85 CDK activity (Huang *et al.*, 2001). Recently, Swinnen *et al.* (2005) have shown that full-length Pho81 is also required to control trehalose metabolism and the postdiauxic shift stress-responsive targets. Moreover, the authors suggest that the PHO pathway functions in parallel to the fermentable growth medium- or Sch9-controlled pathway and that they might share the protein kinase Rim15, which was previously reported to play a central role in the integration of glucose, nitrogen and amino acid availability (Roosen *et al.*, 2004). Several observations also indicate that activity of the Pho80–Pho85 complex appears to be linked to the status of other nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen, as shown by the inability of Δpho85 cells to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources or on media with proline as the sole nitrogen source (Lee *et al.*, 2000). Our model suggests that the downregulation of both the Pho84 transporter and the secreted acid phosphatases in response to an increase in external phosphate is a result of the two distinct pathways. Further studies are needed to elucidate how the PHO and PKA pathways are co-ordinated during phosphate sensing and signalling. Interestingly, under conditions of nonlimited carbon supply, the extracellular P<sub>i</sub> concentration serves as a

amounts of P<sub>i</sub> (10 mM) are added to low-phosphate-grown cells and the high-affinity phosphate transport system (Pho84, Pho89) is no longer operative.

# Concluding remarks

The molecular components involved in the phosphate sensing machinery are still unidentified but findings suggest that phosphate sensing from both the inside and the outside of *S. cerevisiae* cells occurs to adjust the phosphate response to cellular needs. An intracellular phosphate sensing is responsible for activation and repression of the PHO pathway and to allow the cells to respond to phosphate starvation or surplus in correlation with the cellular phosphate reserves available. Direct phosphate molecule recognition seems also to take place at the level of the plasma membrane, involving the high-affinity phosphate transporter Pho84 to adjust phosphate acquisition in response to external phosphate fluctuations. Further studies are now needed to understand how these sensing signals are integrated and coordinated by the cell.
