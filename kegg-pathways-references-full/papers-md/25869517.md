Abstract

The trapping of lipid-laden macrophages in the arterial intima is a critical but reversible step in atherogenesis. However, information about possible treatments for this condition is lacking. Here, we hypothesized that combining the polyphenol-rich fractions (PHC) of commonly consumed spices (Allium sativum L (Liliaceae), Zingiber officinale R (Zingiberaceae), Curcuma longa L (Zingiberaceae)) and herbs (Terminalia arjuna (R) W & A (Combretaceae) and Cyperus rotundus L (Cyperaceae)) prevents foam cell formation and atherogenesis. Using an in vitro foam cell formation assay, we found that PHC significantly inhibited lipid-laden macrophage foam cell formation compared to the depleted polyphenol fraction of PHC (F-PHC). We further observed that PHC attenuated the LDL and LPS induced CD36, p-FAK and PPAR-γ protein expression in macrophages and increased their migration. NK-κB-DNA interaction, TNF-α, ROS generation, and MMP9 and MMP2 protein expression were suppressed in PHC-treated macrophages. The anti-atherosclerotic activity of PHC was investigated in a high fat- and cholesterol-fed rabbit model. The inhibition of foam cell deposition within the aortic intima and atheroma formation confirmed the atheroprotective activity of PHC. Therefore, we conclude that the armoury of polyphenols in PHC attenuates the CD36 signalling cascade-mediated foam cell formation, enhances the migration of these cells and prevents atherogenesis.

# 1. Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death worldwide, and atherosclerosis is the most important factor that contributes to the aetiology and pathology of CVDs [1].

Atherosclerotic intimal thickening is a result of the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages and lymphocytes due to the uptake of 'invading' oxidized pathogenic lipoproteins in the arterial wall [2, 3]. Macrophages have evolved to protect the body from infection via the phagocytosis of pathogens. However, the same properties of macrophages are responsible for the uptake of oxidized lipoproteins and the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other immune mediators. The net effect of this process is foam cell formation and atherogenesis [4]. Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) possesses a high affinity towards macrophage CD36 scavenger receptors, which are also known as FAT (fatty acid translocase), that contribute to lipid accumulation within the cells [5]. CD36 mediates cell-specific responses, such as the inhibition of angiogenesis, promotes endothelial cell apoptosis, and stimulates inflammatory responses (activation nuclear factor-kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells [NF-κB]) and phagocytosis [6]. The uptake of bioactive lipids that directly target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) and trigger the hyper-phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) results in macrophage foam-cell formation and entrapment in the neointima. The entrapped foam cell within the intima subsequently initiates and propagates atheroinflammatory lesions [1, 7].

As a signalling molecule, CD36 plays significant roles in atherogenic processes, including foam cell formation, the release of inflammatory mediators, macrophage trapping and thrombosis. Therefore, targeting the CD36 receptor signalling cascades, ROS generation and LDL oxidation is an attractive option for the treatment of atherosclerosis. However, information on anti-atherosclerotic therapeutic leads from natural sources to target CD36 signalling pathogenic pathways is lacking.
Many spices show anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities and are less toxic than allopathic medicines [8]. Hence, the combination of spices and herbs can be translated into an anti-atherosclerotic functional food via reverse pharmacological transdisciplinary exploratory studies [9]. Based on the traditional and current ethnopharmacological literature, specific spices and herbs were selected for their anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-hyperlipidemic properties. Garlic (Allium sativum Linn.) (Liliaceae) is a potent anti-hyperlipidemic spice that inhibits cholesterol synthesis and LDL oxidation. Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Zingiberaceae) exerts potent hypolipidemic and anti-oxidant effects by scavenging free radicals. Turmeric (Curcuma longa Linn., Zingiberaceae) is known to possess anti-inflammatory properties that attenuate the NF-kB inflammatory signalling pathway [10]. The bark of Terminalia arjuna (Roxb) Wight & Am., (Combretaceae) is known to possess cardiotonic and anti-atherosclerotic properties [11]. Cyperus rotundus Linn. (Cyperaceae), a traditional medicine, possesses anti-inflammatory activity [12]. The polyphenols present in these spices and herbs exert a pleiotropic effect in terms of the prevention of atherosclerosis. However, the pharmacological potential of combined polyphenols remains to be translated [13].

These spices and herbs are being widely used individually in the form of dried powders and extracts as dietary supplements for the treatment of atherogenesis [8]. However, these spices or herbs are insufficient to counteract multi-aetiological foam cell formation and atherogenesis when used individually [2]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the combination of these spices and herbal extracts can strengthen the polyphenol armoury that will target the multiple aetiologies of atherogenesis.

2. Methods and Methods

2.1 Extraction of test materialDried test samples of *Allium sativum* Linn., *Zingiber officinale* Roscoe., *Curcuma longa* Linn., *Terminalia arjuna* (Roxb) Wight & Am. and *Cyperus rotundus* Linn were obtained from the Dabur Research and Development Centre, Ghaziabad India free of charge. The qualitative compliance of the herbal dry powder was confirmed according to the Indian Pharmacopoeia (IP) and WHO monographs (WHO). The test materials were extracted in 50% ethanolic (v/v) solvent. Briefly, 2 Kg of each sample was individually macerated and vortexed in 5 L of 50% ethanol at room temperature for 20 h. The extract was centrifuged at 200 g for 10 min, and the clarified supernatant was decanted in a graduated tube. The extraction step was repeated thrice. All extracts were pooled, and their volumes were reduced by up to 75% under a vacuum evaporator (Buchi Rotavapor R205) at < 45 °C. The extracts were finally dried by lyophilization. The dried individual extracts were stored at -20 °C until further use. The dried individual extracts (50 gm) of A. sativum, Z. officinale, C. longa, T. arjuna and C. rotundus were combined and mixed at equal ratios to obtain a polyphenol-rich combination, which is referred to as “PHC” throughout this study.

### 2.2 Filtration of PHC through column

To probe the effect of a combination of polyphenols on foam cell formation, the PHC was filtered through Oasis HLB (1 cc vac cartridge, 30 mg sorbent per cartridge, 30-μm particle size, [WAT094225]), which is a polymeric reversed-phase sorbent. Because the Oasis HLB sorbent is water wettable, it features a higher retention capability and excellent recoveries. The filtration of PHC with this syringe-barrel-type cartridge extracts a wide range of acidic, basic, and neutral compounds. The filtered fraction of PHC is called filtered PHC (F-PHC).

### 2.3 Determination of total polyphenol content

The total polyphenol contents (TPC) of PHC and F-PHC were determined by spectrophotometry using gallic acid as a standard according to the method described by the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14502-1 [14]. The TPC is expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE) in g/g material.

### 2.4 Determination of total flavonoids content

The total flavonoid contents (TFC) of PHC and F-PHC were estimated as described by Bekir [15]. Quercetin was used as the reference compound to produce the standard curve; the results are expressed as mg of quercetin equivalents (QE)/g of dw.

### 2.5 Cell culture

Mouse macrophage J774A.1 cells were obtained from the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) Pune, India and cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air–5% carbon dioxide at 37°C using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4 mM l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The IC₅₀ of PHC and F-PHC were found to be 865.1 μg/mL and 1286 μg/mL, respectively, for J774A.1 mouse macrophages using a MTT assay (unpublished data). One tenth of the PHC and F-PHC IC₅₀ doses were used to measure the in vitro foam cell formation activity.

### 2.6 Foam cell formation assay

To demonstrate the effect of polyphenols on macrophage foam cell formation, we modified the lipid uptake assays described by Park et al. [16]. Briefly, the J774A.1 cells (2 × 10⁵ cells/well) were seeded in a 6-well plate and incubated with PHC and F-PHC (1 to 200 μg/mL) for 12 h at 37°C. Following incubation, the cells were treated with LPS (5 μg/mL) and LDL (50 μg/mL) for 24 h. The cells were fixed with 6% paraformaldehyde, stained with Oil-Red O and counter-stained with haematoxylin. The lipids were then measured spectrophotometrically (520 nm) following isopropanol extraction, and a morphological evaluation was carried out via microscopy.

### 2.7 Quantification of polyphenols, and flavonoids from PHC

PHC was found to be enriched in TPC and TFP, and it inhibited foam cell formation better than F-PHC. Hence, the polyphenols were quantified, and further experiments were performed with PHC only. Polyphenols (phenolic acids, iso-flavones, flavones, flavonols, flavanols and flavan-3-ols) from PHC were extracted using 90% methanol containing 0.5% acetic acid and measured by HPLC [17]. The mobile phase was run with a combination of - 'A' (50 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate buffer: methanol) (9:1) and 'B' (50 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate buffer: 70% Methanol) (3:7) in gradient manner at a flow rate of 0.47 mL/min for 20 min. A Dionex PA2 RSLC, (Ultimate 3000) 120°AC 18 (100 mm × 2.1 mm) 2.1-µm column was used. The sample was filtered through a 0.2-µm filter for injection, and the absorbances were measured at 250, 280, 320, and 370 nm.

### 2.8 Western blot analysis

Mouse J774A.1 macrophages were incubated with PHC for 12 h and exposed to LPS (5 µg/mL) and LDL (50 µg/mL) for 24 h. The cells were then lysed in a solution of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate. The clarified lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with antibodies against CD36, PPAR-γ and phospho-FAK. After chemiluminescence detection, the membranes were stripped with stripping buffer and re-probed with antibodies against β-actin and FAK for normalization. The band intensities were quantified using ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).

### 2.9 Cell migration

To reveal the effect of the combination of polyphenols (PHC) on mouse macrophage migration, we followed the in vitro “scratch” wound-healing model previously described by Tamura [18, 19]. Briefly, in vitro “scratch” wounds were created by scraping confluent cell

monolayers on gelatine-coated (0.2%) 24-well plates using a sterile pipette tip. After a 24-h incubation in cell culture media, the cell migration was quantified by counting the number of cells that migrated from the wound edge.

### 2.10 ROS detection

J774A.1 mouse macrophages were pre-treated with PHC and then challenged with LPS (5 μg/mL) to stimulate ROS production. The cells were then stained with carboxy-H2DCFDA (25 μM) and for 30 minutes at 37°C. The nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. Labelled cells were counted by microscopy (Olympus), and the fluorescence intensity was measured with a 96-well fluorescence plate reader [1, 16].

### 2.11 Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay

J774A.1 mouse macrophage cells were pre-treated with PHC and incubated with LPS (5 μg/mL) and LDL (50 μg/mL). The medium was removed, and the concentration of TNF-α was measured using a milliplex kit. The effect of PHC on the binding of NF-κB to biotin-labelled DNA nucleotides was evaluated using a Light Shift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Thermo scientific) per the manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA method. A NF-κB subunit binding protein detection system was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the complementary oligonucleotide probes containing the NF-κB binding motifs (5′TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′, and 5′-CCACGCCCTCCCTGGAAAAGTCCCCAGCGGAAAGTCCCCTTGTAACA-3′) were labelled with Biotin at the 5′ end. The nuclear extracts, which contained 5 μg of protein, were incubated with the labelled oligonucleotide at room temperature for 20 minutes. The NF-κB-DNA binding was measured by enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified using the Image J software.

2.12 Gelatine zymography

Conditioned media samples from J774A.1 macrophage cells were incubated with and without PHC for 12 h and treated with LPS (5 μg/mL) and LDL (50 μg/mL) for 24 h. They were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels containing 1 mg/mL gelatine. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice with denaturing buffer (2.5% Triton X-100) for 30 minutes, rinsed in water and further incubated for 24 h in developing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl₂) at 37°C. The gel was subsequently fixed and stained using a Coomassie blue stain solution (methanol : acetic acid : water [50 : 10 : 40] 0.1% Coomassie Blue R 250) for 4–5 h at room temperature and de-stained with washing solution (methanol : acetic acid : water [50 : 10 : 40]) for 1–2 h. The band intensities were quantified using the Image-J analyser.

2.13 Animals

The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (IAEC# P46/IAEC/NIN/2011/12/BDK/NZ/rabbit/Male/24) of the National Institute of Nutrition, Indian Council of Medical Research, Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and family welfare, Govt. of India, Hyderabad, India. New Zealand white male rabbits (n = 25) weighing 1.5 to 2 Kg were obtained from NCLAS, NIN (ICMR) and housed for 3–4 months in accordance with the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision on Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA, India) and Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. Autoclaved food and water were provided ad libitum.

2.14 Anti-atherosclerotic activity

To evaluate the anti-atherosclerotic activity of PHC, we used rabbits fed a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet to induce atherosclerosis, as described previously [20]. Twenty-five rabbits were randomly divided into five groups (n = 5 in each group) based on body weight (1.5 to 2

Kg). The WHO posology states daily doses of 300-1000 mg of garlic extract, 2-4 g of ginger, and 0.5 to 1 g tincture of turmeric. The human (~60 Kg) to rabbit (~1.5 Kg) dose conversion factor is 0.07 [21]. Based on the pharmacometrics calculation, the doses of individual spice extracts were ~21 mg/rabbit/day of garlic, ~140 mg/rabbit/day of ginger and ~35 mg/rabbit/day of turmeric. The spices and herbs in PHC were combined at equal ratios. Hence, a 100 and 200 mg/Kg/day dose of PHC delivered 20 and 40 mg/Kg/day, respectively, of spices and herbs to each rabbit, which was found to be human equivalent dose. In addition, our previous anti-inflammatory anti-hyperlipidemic study found that 100 and 200 mg/Kg doses were potent and efficacious (unpublished data). Hence, the 100 and 200 mg/Kg/day P.O doses of PHC were selected to evaluate the anti-atherosclerotic activity. Because the t<sub>1/2</sub> of polyphenols varied from 0.5 h to 7 h [22], 50 mg/Kg b.i.d PHC (100 mg/Kg/day P.O.) and 100 mg/Kg b.i.d PHC (200 mg/Kg/day P.O.) were administered in the current investigation.

Group I, which was the negative control, received a normal NIN (ICMR) standard rabbit diet and 10 mL/Kg P.O. water. Group II, which was the positive control, was fed a high cholesterol and high fat diet (HCFD - tallow: 20%, cholesterol: 1.5%) ad libitum and 10 mL/Kg P.O. water. Group III was fed a HCFD and received 50 mg/Kg P.O. PHC in water (b.i.d = bis in die = twice a day); Group IV was fed a HCFD and 100 mg/Kg P.O. PHC in water b.i.d. Group V was the standard drug group and was fed a HCFD and atorvastatin 5 mg/Kg P.O. b.i.d. The HCFD was fed for 12 weeks. At the end of the 12<sup>th</sup> week, blood was withdrawn from the marginal ear vein to measure the biochemical (total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), HDL, VLDL, LDL, glucose, and TBARS) parameters. The animals were killed with a 100 mg/Kg i.v. dose of xylazin anesthesia and perfused with normal saline. The heart and the thoracic and abdominal aortae were isolated, and the excess surrounding tissues were removed. Sections from the aortic arch were fixed in liquid nitrogen for Oil-Red O staining or fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis.

The organs (liver, lungs, kidney, brain, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, heart, testis, stomach and intestine) were removed and stored in 4% paraformaldehyde for histopathological analyses, and the tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

### 2.15 Statistical analysis

The data were analysed with an ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. P < 0.05 was considered significant. The data are expressed as the mean ± SE. The percentage inhibitory response was plotted as a function of the log dose with a sigmoidal dose-response curve (variable slope), in which Log EC₅₀ is the X value that corresponds to a response midway between the bottom and top. The analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism Software.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Determination of total polyphenol content

The total phenolic contents (TPC) in PHC and F-PHC were found to be 232.21 mg of GAE/gm and 0.85 mg of GAE/gm, respectively. PHC was enriched with polyphenols due to the combination of spices and herbal extracts.

### 3.2 Determination of total flavonoids content

The total flavonoid content (TFC) in PHC and F-PHC was 4.18 mg of QE/gm and 0.006 mg of QE/gm, respectively.

### 3.3 PHC blocks LPS and LDL induced foam cell formation

We examined the influence of combined polyphenols (PHC) on foam cell formation, which is an important marker of the early stages of atherosclerosis. Only LDL weakly influenced the

foam cell formation, while macrophages co-treated with LDL with LPS resulted in typical foam cells formation. The foam cells formed by macrophages were analysed with Oil-red O staining. J774A.1 mouse macrophage cells treated with LPS and LDL exhibited extensive Oil-Red O droplets, unlike negative control cells (Figure 1A, 1B). Treating cells with PHC (1 to 200 μg/mL) significantly prevented lipid accumulation in cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1C–1F). However, F-PHC could not inhibit lipid deposition within the cells (Figure 1G–1J). The IC₅₀ values for the inhibition of foam cell formation were found to be 19.02 μg/mL and 284.9 μg/mL for PHC and F-PHC, respectively (Figure 1K, 1L). PHC better inhibited foam cell formation induced by LPS than F-PHC.

### 3.4 Phytochemicals in PHC

The polyphenols were quantified in PHC, as it was found to be rich in TPC and TFC. Phenolic acids, such as gallic acid (100.4 mg/100 g), catechin gallate (461 mg/100 g), quercetin-3-βD glucoside (138.5 mg/100 g), p-coumaric acid (32.9 mg/100 g), ferulic acid (3 mg/100 g), and caffeic acid (8.7 mg/100 g); flavonoids, such as catechin (30.2 mg/100 g), ellagic acid, kaempferol, daidzein, and apigenin-7-o-neohesperidoside; and phytochemicals, such as curcumin (18.31 mg/100 g), allylic sulphide (37.13 mg/100 g), alliin, and 6-gingerol, were identified and quantified in PHC (Supplementary Figure 1 and Table 1).

### 3.5 Effect of PHC on CD36, PPAR-γ, FAK, and p-FAK protein expression

Because the CD36 signalling cascade plays a critical role in foam cell formation and entrapment, the effect of PHC on the CD36, PPAR-γ and p-FAK protein levels was evaluated. Western blot analyses revealed that treating cells with LPS and LDL significantly increased the expressions of CD36, PPAR-γ and p-FAK proteins compared to the negative control cells (Figure 2A). The levels of FAK protein did not significantly differ in these cells (Figure 2C). The expression levels of CD36, p-FAK, and PPAR-γ protein (Figure 2B, 2D,

2E) significantly decreased in PHC pre-treated cells (20 to 80 μg/mL) in a concentration-dependent manner compared to the cells treated with LPS and LDL together. The CD36, p-FAK and PPAR-γ levels were reduced by 81.2%, 43.2%, and 62.0% by 40 μg/mL PHC. The phosphorylation of FAK may have been due to either direct CD36 signalling or the CD36-mediated uptake of biologically active oxidized lipids.

### 3.6 Cell migration assay

Macrophage migration is governed by a balance between detachments due to the breaking of established focal adhesion contacts and attachments due to the establishment of new focal adhesion contacts. Macrophage cell attachment and detachment are controlled by focal adhesions kinase (FAK), and these processes aid actin polymerization-mediated lamellipodia formation. Macrophage migration was examined using the in vitro wound healing assay, which consisted of creating scratch wounds in confluent monolayers of J774.A, as shown in Figure (2F and 2G). Twenty-four hours of LDL and LPS treatment inhibited >90% of macrophage cell migration. PHC-treatment significantly restored macrophage migration was in a concentration-dependent manner. A 60-μg/mL treatment of PHC significantly (74.8%) restored cell migration.

### 3.7 Inhibition of ROS generation in macrophage

Given the well-documented anti-oxidative mechanisms of polyphenols, we focused on the influence of ROS production on the PHC-mediated inhibition of foam cell formation. The cells were treated with PHC and LPS to examine the impact of the ROS-scavenging activity of PHC on macrophage migration and the phosphorylation of FAK. LPS treatment significantly increased ROS generation (70 to 80%) in macrophage cells, as indicated by intense DCF staining (merged image of both stains) (Figure 2H). Pre-incubating macrophages

with PHC 60 μg/mL resulted in greater than 90% scavenging of LPS-induced ROS (Figure 2I and 2J).

### 3.8 Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay

Because macrophages produce athero-inflammatory lesions within the intima in response to inflammatory lipids, the anti-inflammatory effect of PHC on interleukin synthesis was determined based on transcription factor NF-κB-DNA nucleotide binding. LPS and LDL treatment significantly increased the nuclear translocation of NF-κB-DNA, as evidenced by intense shifted bands in the nuclear extracts prepared from these cells. PHC treatment significantly inhibited these shifts in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3A); 60 μg/mL PHC significantly (85.4%) inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB-DNA.

#### Effect of PHC on TNF-α

Because PHC inhibited the NF-κB-DNA interaction, the subsequent effect on the release of pro-inflammatory interleukins was evaluated by ELISA. TNF-α secretion was increased (1636 ± 319.3 pg/mL) in cells treated with LPS and LDL compared to untreated negative controls (195.9 ± 49.58 pg/mL). Pre-treatment with PHC (IC₅₀: 26.13 μg/mL) significantly reduced the TNF-α concentration (Figure 3B).

### 3.9 Gelatin zymography

NF-κB-DNA increases the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP 9 and 2) in response to oxLDL, which weakens the strength of the fibrous cap atheroma. Hence, the effect of PHC on the expression of MMPs was measured by gelatin zymography. The protein expression levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 increased in macrophages treated with LDL and LPS, and treatment with PHC suppressed this expression in a concentration-dependent

manner (Figure 5C). A 60-μg/mL dose of PHC decreased the expression of both MMP-9 and MMP-2 by >60% (Figure 3D, and 3E).

### 3.10 Anti-atherosclerosis activity of PHC

To evaluate the effect of PHC on atherogenesis, we assessed the lipid profile and aortic sections of rabbits fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet. The plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL and LDL lipid parameters significantly increased in the positive control group compared to the negative control. The oral administration of 50 and 100 mg/Kg b.i.d, PHC significantly reduced the plasma Ch, ~23% and ~40%, Tg, VLDL ~87% and ~91%, LDL 7.5% and ~29% and plasma TBARS 50% and ~66%, respectively. Atorvastatin significantly reduced the plasma Ch (~51%), TG and VLDL (~49%), LDL (~48%) and TBARS (~34%) levels. The atherogenic index was reduced in PHC-and atorvastatin-treated rabbits (Table 1). The Oil-red O and haematoxylin histopathological staining indicated significant endothelial interruption, the thickening of the intima and the development of advanced atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic arch sections of the positive control groups (Figure. 4A, 4B). Administration of 50 and 100 mg/Kg b.i.d PHC inhibited atherogenesis in a dose-dependent manner and improved the aortic architecture (Figure 4D and 4E, respectively). The aortic walls appeared normal in PHC-and atorvastatin-treated rabbits. The endothelial cell lining and muscle fibres appeared normal. The morphological architecture of the LS and TS of the aorta were observed by SEM, which revealed the regular arrangement of the intima (endothelial cells) in palisades and a closely aligned smooth in the negative control (Figure 4A). An irregular arrangement of the intima, a rough endothelial surface with abundant foam cell deposition, prominent fatty plaques and a fatty area were observed in the positive control group (Figure 4B). Type V lesions: Fibrothroma (Type Va: lesions with a lipid core) were recorded in the aortae of positive control rabbits. A group of foam cells was visible near the collagen sheets of the sub-endothelium. Small groups of endothelial cells had

spread in an extreme attempt to cover the destroyed basal lamina, and a normal junction complex was lacking between these extremely flattened cells and clusters of foam cells, monocytes, macrophages and platelets. Regular arrangement, a partial smooth surface and minimum plaques were observed in PHC 50 mg/Kg b.i.d.-treated group (Figure 4C). Type III lesions (intermediate lesion/ transitional lesion, and as pre-atheroma) were observed in PHC 50 mg/Kg b.i.d.-treated rabbit aortae. The longitudinal and transverse sections of the aortic architecture of PHC 100 mg/Kg b.i.d-treated rabbit were comparable to those of the negative control and atorvastatin -treated groups (Figure 4D, 4E). Type I lesions (initial lesion) were rarely recorded in the aortae of PHC 100 mg/Kg b.i.d-treated rabbits.

A HFCD encouraged fat deposition in the liver, spleen, and adrenal glands, as indicated by the histopathological analysis. Due to the fat deposition in the liver of positive control rabbits, the extensive peri-portal fatty balloon degeneration of hepatocytes accompanied inflammation (Figure 5). This degeneration was observed beyond the portal track. In PHC-treated (50 mg/Kg b.i.d) rabbits, the livers showed a slightly expanded portal tract with mild lymphatic inflammation. The peri-portal area showed a minimally preserved normal hepatocyte area with maximum degeneration. An extensive collection of macrophages was also found in the red pulp of the spleen. The extensive deposition of fat in the zona fasciculata with cholesterol cleft formation and inflammation was also observed in the adrenal gland of positive control animals. Normal white pulp along with slightly red pulp degeneration due to fat deposition was recorded in the spleen. Marginally fat-laden cells were observed in the adrenal gland. Treatment with PHC (100 mg/Kg b.i.d) was found to preserve normal hepatocytes and reduce the extent of fatty cell degeneration. The normal architecture of the spleen was preserved in PHC-treated rabbits. The zona glomerulosa was normal and contained few fatty deposits in the adrenal grand of PHC-treated rabbits. Atorvastatin treatment expanded the portal tracks and resulted in lymphatic inflammation with defined

borders. The fat deposition within the spleen resulted in red pulp degeneration. The zona fasiculata contained a large collection of cells with fat deposition and a cholesterol cleft, along with mild lymphocyte infiltration. This histological observation also correlated with the AST, ATP, ALT, total protein, and creatinine levels (Table 1). The histopathology of the brain, lungs, stomach, intestine, heart and testis was normal in all groups.

4. Discussion

Macrophage disappearance of entrapped foam cell formation cells from the intima regresses atheroma lesions which represent a novel target for potential therapeutic intervention [23, 24]. Previous studies of atherogenesis and regression have revealed that antioxidants can be used to inhibit the production of ROS-mediated macrophage entrapment and the subsequent restoration of cell migration [1, 2]. Kishimoto et al. (2013) reported that in addition to antioxidant activity, polyphenols exert pleiotropic effects in the prevention of atherogenesis [13].

The current investigation suggests that PHC, which contains a combination of polyphenols, attenuates macrophage foam cell formation and entrapment and enhances the emigration compared to filtered PHC (F-PHC).

Previous studies have reported that oxLDL acts as an agonist of the macrophage CD36 receptor signalling cascade and ultimately facilitates lipid-laden foam cell formation [1]. In the current investigation, PHC inhibited lipid deposition within macrophage cells compared to F-PHC, which correlated with the presence of polyphenols. Hence, the individual polyphenols in PHC, such as gallic acid, ellagic acid, catechin, epicatechin, quercetin, ferulic acid, and caffeic acid, were quantified in detail. The combination of these polyphenols (PHC) inhibited lipid deposition within the cell by inhibiting LDL oxidation and/or suppressing the CD36 receptor signalling cascade.

Previous studies of foam cell signalling cascades have revealed that the CD36 signalling receptor on macrophages activates transcription factors, such as NF-κB and PPAR-γ, and mediates the sustained phosphorylation of FAK. This signalling cascade activation promotes inflammatory stress, the internalisation of oxLDL, CD36 protein synthesis and cellular immobilization via enhanced actin polymerization [25-27]. The CD36 signalling cascade enhances macrophage foam cell formation, spreading and inhibits macrophage migration [1, 25]. To the best of our knowledge, the current study demonstrated for the first that PHC attenuated the protein expression of CD36, PPAR-γ, and p-FAK and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in macrophages treated with LPS and LDL. The decrease in the protein expression of PPAR-γ correlated with a decrease in lipid deposition within the macrophages and reduced CD36 protein expression. The observed crosstalk between foam cell formation and protein expression indicates that PHC attenuated foam cell formation by abrogating the CD36 receptor signalling cascade.

The interaction between oxLDL and CD36 has been reported to activate specific Src kinases, which mediate FAK phosphorylation and actin polymerization [28, 29]. This interaction also leads to the NADPH oxidase-mediated generation of intracellular ROS, which in turn induces the oxidative inactivation of SHP-2. This inactivation further results in sustained FAK activation and perturbs cytoskeletal disassembly. The net effects are the enhancement of cell spreading with a concomitant inhibition of migration, which traps cells in the neointima [1, 30]. In the present study, the suppression of the hyper-phosphorylation of FAK in macrophages by PHC treatment correlated with the inhibition of ROS generation and acquisition of a motile phenotype. The combined polyphenols (PHC) potentially inhibited the LPS-induced generation of ROS. The ability of PHC to scavenge ROS indirectly suppressed the hyper-phosphorylation of FAK within macrophages, which facilitated the restoration of cell motility by maintaining the balance between cytoskeletal assembly and disassembly.

cytoskeletal balance resulted in short-lived, actin polymerization-driven lamellipodia extension, the disruption of existing focal contacts and the formation of new focal contacts. The treatment of macrophages with PHC facilitated cellular egress from the neointima and prevented atherogenesis.

The NF-κB-DNA interaction in lipid-laden macrophages has been reported to involve NF-κB, MMPs and the release of inflammatory cytokines, which in turn leads to atherosclerosis [25, 31-33]. The intimal entrapped macrophage secrete cytokines and increase inflammatory stress within the intima [34]. The proteases secreted at the atheromatous plaque, such as MMPs, destroy the extracellular matrix, decrease the physical strength of the fibrous cap in the atheroma and increase vulnerability [35]. Phytochemicals such as curcumin are known to interfere with NF-κB-DNA binding and inhibit inflammatory signalling pathways [36, 37].

The current investigation demonstrated that PHC inhibited the activation and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-κB and suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, and proteases, such as MMP2 and MMP9. The suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and MMP release reduced the inflammatory stress in the intima and stabilized the atheromas.

The overall *in vitro* study result signifies that the polyphenols in PHC collectively attenuated the protein expression of CD36, p-FAK, PPAR-γ, and NF-κB. The decreased production of TNF-α, MMPs, ROS and ox-LDL due to PHC treatment attenuated foam cell formation and inflammatory cascades while enhancing the migration of macrophages (Figure 6).

The antiatherosclerotic activity of PHC *in vivo* was evaluated in rabbits fed a HCFD. PHC significantly suppressed hyperlipidaemia and the atherogenic ratio in rabbits fed a HCFD. PHC inhibited the oxidation of serum lipid (TBARS), which may be due to the combination of polyphenols. Similarly, polyphenols scavenge conjugated dienes (free radicals), which has been reported to inhibit the lipid oxidative chain reaction. This inhibition may confer an atheroprotective effect [38-40]. Atorvastatin is known to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis and

reduce plasma cholesterol by inhibiting hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA) [41-43]. Similarly, phytoconstituents, such as diallyl sulphide, allicin, ajoene and allyl mercaptan from A. sativum extracts, were reported to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, which inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver [44]. PHC contains diallyl sulphide and polyphenols that have been found to reduce lipid levels and oxidation as well as prevent atherogenesis, as shown in the present investigation. We also observed a decrease in the plasma lipid concentration in PHC-treated animals, which may be due to the inhibition of pancreatic, macrophage and hepatic lipase enzymes. PHC may be more effective in reducing triglyceride levels than cholesterol levels. The liver function parameters were significantly increased in rabbits treated with atorvastatin compared to those treated with PHC. The liver and kidney histopathology of atorvastatin- and PHC-treated rabbits correlated with the liver and kidney function tests. Atorvastatin is known to increase the level of liver enzymes as a side effect; accordingly, we also found histopathological changes in addition to changes in the liver and kidney function tests in rabbits treated with atorvastatin [45, 46]. We did not observe any observable clinical and biochemical negative side effects in PHC-treated rabbits. We consider PHC treatment safer than Atorvastatin treatment. PHC treatment did not exert any other harmful effects in rabbits in the present study. Taken together, PHC was found to be moderately anti-hyperlipidemic and safer than Atorvastatin.

Advanced atheromata were observed in the sections of the aortic arch of rabbits fed a HCFD, which was accompanied by entrapped foam cells within the intimal region. PHC and atorvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of advanced atheroma in the aortic arch and entrapment of foam cells within the intimal region in rabbits fed a HCFD. The attenuation of atherogenesis by PHC treatment was due to the abrogation of foam cell formation and the entrapment or emigration of trapped foam cells from intimal lesions. PHC treatment inhibited the thickening of the intima and media as well as the spreading of fibres and maintained a
normal artery architecture, as shown in the SEM images. Type I (initial lesion) atheroma lesions were recorded in PHC-treated rabbits. The reduction of the plasma lipid levels and their oxidation (TBARS) by PHC treatment linearly correlated with the inhibition of atherogenesis. The liver and kidney functions were better in PHC-treated animals than in positive control and atorvastatin-treated animals. This finding further substantiated the improved hepatic histopathology and apparent prevention of fatty liver syndrome. Correspondingly, the histopathological evaluation showed that PHC was more effective in preventing fatty liver syndrome and safer than atorvastatin. The *in vivo* study shows that PHC can be used as a prophylactic against hyperlipidaemia, oxidative stress and atherogenesis.

**Conclusion**

The results of our *in vivo* and *in vitro* studies indicate that the polyphenol-rich extract PHC exerts a better prophylactic effect and prevents atherogenesis by inhibiting foam cell formation. This study provided a mechanism by which the armoury of polyphenols in exerts anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperlipidemic effects to counteract foam cell-mediated atherogenesis. We have also shown that PHC treatment favourably reversed macrophage immobility, which may permit the necessary foam cell movement to egress. The reduced mobility of macrophages might reverse the formation of athero-inflammatory lesions and atherosclerosis.

Figure 4. Atherosclerotic morphological changes in rabbit aortic arch.

Histological sections of aortas from five groups of rabbits (n = 5 in each group) stained with Oil red O-hematoxylin and SEM analysis (TS and LS). Note bright red-stained lipids in atherosclerotic plaques. Rabbits were fed: A) standard NIN diet (negative control): absence of atheroma, intact intima; B) High cholesterol and high fat diet (HCFD) (positive control): presence of advanced atheroma, extensive lipid deposition within the intima; C) HCFD + PHC 50 mg/Kg P.O b.i.d: presence of fatty sticks, thickening of intima, partially lipid deposition and rarely destroyed endothelial cells; D) HCFD + PHC 100 mg/Kg P.O. b.i.d and E) HCFD + atorvastatin 5 mg/Kg P.O b.i.d: occasional presence of fatty sticks, foam cell, normal architecture of endothelial cell, intact intima, media and rarely destroyed endothelial cells and presence of foam cells. M: media; A: atherosclerotic plaques stained with oil red O; and F: foam cell and fatty streak; E: Endothelial cells.

Figure 5. Histopathological observation of vital organs of rabbits

Animals were fed HCFD for three months which produces toxicity in vital organs. Typical histological pictures of liver, spleen, adrenal gland and kidney tissue structure. H&E stained tissue pictures were manifested by 20×. Arrows showing portal tract and central vein in liver, white and red pulp in spleen, zona fistula in adrenal gland and glomeruli and tubules in kidney. Positive control: extensive fat deposition, fatty ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes with infiltration of lymphocytes in liver. Deposition of cholesterol clefts, and extent of HCFD induced damage to liver, spleen, and adrenal gland and was found to be lesser at PHC 50 mg/Kg b.i.d and PHC 100 mg/Kg b.i.d as compared to positive control and atorvastatin 5 mg/Kg b.i.d. treatment. Glomeruli and tubules are marked in kidney.

Figure 6. Model depicting effect of PHC on CD36-dependent mechanism of macrophage trapping in the neointima.

PHC suppressed oxidation of LDL an agonist of CD36 receptor leading to foam cell formation. PHC abrogated foam cell formation by attenuation of CD36, PPAR-γ, p-FAK and NF-κB protein expression. PHC barred PPAR-γ mediated lipid deposition and CD36 protein synthesis within the cell. Consecutively treatment of PHC maintained balance between cytoskeletal assembly and disassembly resulted in short live actin polymerization driven lamellipodia extension, enhanced trapped cell movement. PHC reduced ROS generation and activation of FAK in breaking adhesion, and motility restoration of entrapped macrophage from inflamed intima. Continually PHC inhibited NF-κB-DNA binding and reduced release of cytokines (TNF-α) and MMPs leads and barring inflammatory lesion progression. The net effect of PHC was detraction of CD36 facilitated foam cell formation, spreading and its concomitant inhibition of migration.
