The genetic determinants of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) include the *rfe* and *rff* genes located between *ilv* and *cya* near min 85 on the *Escherichia coli* chromosome. The *rfe-rff* gene cluster of *E. coli* K-12 was cloned in the cosmid pHC79. The cosmid clone complemented mutants defective in the synthesis of ECA due to lesions in the *rfe*, *rffE*, *rffD*, *rffA*, *rffC*, *rffT*, and *rffM* genes. Restriction endonuclease mapping combined with complementation studies of the original cosmid clone and six subclones revealed the order of genes in this region to be *rfe-rffD/rffE-rffA/rffC-rffT-rffM*.

The *rfe* gene was localized to a 2.54-kilobase *ClaI* fragment of DNA, and the complete nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined. The nucleotide sequencing data revealed two open reading frames, ORF-1 and ORF-2, located on the same strand of DNA. The putative initiation codon of ORF-1 was found to be 570 nucleotides downstream from the termination codon of *rho*. ORF-1 and ORF-2 specify putative proteins of 257 and 348 amino acids with calculated *M*<sub>r</sub> values of 29,010 and 39,771, respectively. ORF-1 was identified as the *rfe* gene since ORF-1 alone was able to complement defects in the synthesis of ECA and O8-side chain synthesis in *rfe* mutants of *E. coli*. Data are also presented which suggest the possibility that the *rfe* gene is the structural gene for the tunicamycin sensitive UDP-GlcNAc:undecaprenylphosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase that catalyzes the synthesis of GlcNAc-pyrophosphorylundecaprenol (lipid I), the first lipid-linked intermediate involved in ECA synthesis.

Enterobacterial common antigen (ECA)<sup>1</sup> is a glycolipid produced by all members of the Enterobacteriaceae (1–3). The carbohydrate portion of ECA consists of *N*-acetyl-*D*-glucosamine (GlcNAc), *N*-acetyl-*D*-mannosaminuronic acid (ManNAcA), and 4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-*D*-galactose (Fuc4NAc) (4, 5). These amino sugars form linear polysaccharide chains comprised of the trisaccharide repeat unit →3)-α-*D*-Fuc4NAc-(1→4)-β-*D*-ManNAcA-(1→4)-α-*D*-GlcNAc-(1→(4). The heteropolysaccharide chains are linked to phosphatidic acid molecules through phosphodiester linkage; the phospholipid moiety serves to anchor the polysaccharide chains in the outer membrane (6). All bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae possess the phospholipid-linked ECA polysaccharide chains (ECA<sub>PL</sub>). However, certain rough strains also possess ECA polysaccharide chains linked to the core region of lipopolysaccharide (ECA<sub>LPS</sub>) (7).

The early steps involved in synthesis of ECA polysaccharide chains have been determined in considerable detail (8–10). The initial trisaccharide repeat unit is assembled as a lipid-linked intermediate (lipid III) in a sequential series of reactions that involve participation of the polyisoprenoid lipid, undecaprenyl monophosphate (Fig. 1). Subsequent steps utilize lipid III as a substrate for polysaccharide chain elongation (8). However, the mechanism of chain elongation remains to be established.

The genetic determinants of ECA synthesis include the *rfe-rff* gene cluster located between *ilv* and *uvrD* at min 85 of the *Escherichia coli* chromosome (11, 12). The *rffE* and *rffD* genes are involved in the synthesis of UDP-ManNAcA, and they code for the enzymes UDP-GlcNAc-2-epimerase and UDP-ManNAc dehydrogenase, respectively (11). The isolation and characterization of Tn10-insertion mutants of *E. coli* defective in ECA synthesis have recently resulted in the identification of additional genes involved in the ECA biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1) (13). The *rffA* gene codes for the transaminase that catalyzes the conversion of TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-*D*-glucose to TDP-*D*-fucosamine. The *rffM* and *rffT* genes specify the transferases responsible for the transfer of ManNAcA from UDP-ManNAcA to lipid I and the transfer of Fuc4NAc from TDP-Fuc4NAc to lipid II, respectively. The *rffC* locus appears to be involved in the elongation of ECA chains. In addition, his-linked *rfb* genes of *Salmonella typhimurium* have been shown to be required for synthesis of the Fuc4NAc residues of ECA (14). Accordingly, *rfbA* is the structural gene for TDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and the *rfbB* gene codes for TDP-glucose oxidoreductase.

The *rfe* gene is essential for ECA synthesis, but the function of *rfe* has not been determined. The *rfe* gene is also required for synthesis of lipopolysaccharide O-side chains in *Salmonella montevideo*, *Salmonella minnesota*, and *E. coli* O8, 09,

020, and 0101 (7, 15). Recent studies from this laboratory have established that ECA-negative *rfe::Tn10*-insertion mutants of *E. coli* are defective in lipid I synthesis (13). These observations suggested the possibility that the *rfe* gene codes for the transferase that catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc 1-phosphate from UDP-GlcNAc to undecaprenyl monophosphate to yield lipid I. However, the role of *rfe* in O-side chain synthesis is not yet understood.

The present study describes the isolation of a cosmid clone that contains all of the *rff* and *rfe* genes known to be involved in ECA synthesis. Restriction enzyme mapping of the cosmid clone and subclones combined with complementation studies has allowed the construction of a partial map of the *rfe-rff* region. We also report the cloning of the *rfe* gene on a 2.54-kb *ClaI* fragment of *E. coli* DNA. An open reading frame within the 2.54-kb fragment was identified that complements defects in the synthesis of both ECA and O8-side chains in *rfe::Tn10*-insertion mutants of *E. coli*, and the nucleotide sequence of the putative *rfe* gene is presented. Data are also presented which suggest the possibility that the *rfe* gene encodes the UDP-GlcNAc:undecaprenylphosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase responsible for lipid I synthesis.

**EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES**

**Bacterial Strains and Media**—Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Phages P1 (15) and Ω8 (16) were of the laboratory collection. Cultures were grown with vigorous aeration in either Proteose Peptone (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) beef extract medium containing 0.2% glucose (medium A) or Luria-Bertani medium (17) containing 0.2% glucose (medium B). Luria-Bertani (LB) plates (17) containing 5 mM CaCl₂ were used for the preparation of P1-lysates. Tetracycline was added to media to give a final concentration of 10 μg/ml in order to select for the presence of transposon Tn10. Ampicillin was added to media to give a final concentration of 100 μg/ml where necessary to select and maintain transformants harboring plasmid-borne ampicillin resistance determinants.

**Radiochemicals, Chemicals, and Reagents**—Uridine diphosphate N-acetyl-D-[6-³H]glucosamine (UDP-[³H]NGlcNAc, 18.9 Ci/mmol) and En³Hance were purchased from Du Pont-New England Nuclear. N-Acetyl-D-[1-³H]glucosamine ([³H]GlcNAc, 5.79 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Corp. X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-D-galactopyranoside) was purchased from Bethesda Research Laboratories. Tunicamycin (mixture of isomers A, B, C, and D) was purchased from Sigma. Stock solutions of tunicamycin were prepared by dissolving the drug in 25 mM NaOH to give a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. All enzymes active on DNA were purchased from either Bethesda Research Laboratories, Boehringer Mannheim, or New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), and they were used as directed by the manufacturer. Plasmids pBR322 and pBluescript KS were purchased from Bethesda Research Laboratories and Stratagene Cloning Systems (La Jolla, CA), respectively. Mouse anti-ECA monoclonal antibody MAb898 (IgG2a) (18) was kindly provided by Dr. Dieter Bitter-Suermann, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Federal Republic of Germany. Ready-Safe scintillation counting fluid was purchased from Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA. All other reagents and chemicals were purchased from standard commercial sources.

**DNA Methods**—The DNA methods used are those described by Sambrook et al. (19). These include the isolation of both chromosomal and plasmid DNA and the analysis of restriction endonuclease-treated plasmid DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis. Restriction endonuclease digestions and DNA ligations were carried out as recommended by the manufacturer.

**Construction of Cosmid Clone pCA11 and Subclones**—The cosmid cloning of *E. coli* DNA was carried out using total chromosomal DNA from *E. coli* strain AN2618 that had been partially cut with the enzyme Sau3A. DNA fragments (20 μg) within the 34–49-kb size range were ligated to the cosmid vector pHc79 (10 μg) following digestion of the vector with *BamHI* and treatment with alkaline phosphatase. A portion of the ligated DNA (7.5 μg) was packaged into λ-phage heads using a packaging extract prepared from strains BHB2690 and BHB2688 (19). The ECA-negative mutant strains 21546, 21548, and 21550 were each transduced with 1.5 μg of the packaged DNA and ampicillin-resistant transductants were selected. ECA synthesis was rescued in one of the transductants derived from strain 21546 as determined by passive hemagglutination and immunoblot assays; cosmid pCA11 was isolated from this clone.

Subclones of pCA11 were constructed, and they were used to transform ECA-negative strains possessing various *rff* and *rfe* mutations. All of the transformants were selected as ampicillin-resistant colonies due to the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinant in the respective plasmid vector sequences. The ability of subclones to complement the various *rff* and *rfe* mutations was determined by screening the transformants for their ability to synthesize ECA as determined by colony immunoblot and passive hemagglutination assays. Plasmid pCA25 contains the entire pHc79 vector sequence, and it was obtained by digestion of pCA11 with *XhoI* followed by religation. Plasmid pCA81 contains only a portion of the pHc79 vector sequence, and it was constructed by digestion of pCA11 with *BglII* followed by religation. Plasmid pCA32 was obtained by digestion of pCA11 with *HindIII* followed by ligation of the resulting *HindIII* fragments into the single *HindIII* site of pBR322. Plasmid pCA53 was constructed by digestion of pCA11 with *ClaI* and subsequent ligation of the *ClaI* fragments into the single *ClaI* site of pBR322. Plasmid pCA62 was constructed by digestion of pCA32 with *XhoI* and *HindIII* followed by ligation of the resulting 4.9-kb fragment into the *SalI* and *HindIII* sites of pBR322. Plasmid pRL105 was obtained by digestion of pCA25 with *BamHI* and *XhoI* followed by ligation of

the resulting 7.5-kb fragment into the corresponding sites in the poly-
linker region of pBluescript KS.

**Strategy of DNA Sequencing—** The nucleotide sequence of the 2.54-
kb *ClaI* fragment containing the *rfe* gene was obtained by the dideoxy
chain termination method of Sanger et al. (20) using Sequenase. Double-stranded plasmid templates included the intact *ClaI* fragment
in pBluescript SK and pBluescript KS as well as various subclones
obtained by restriction fragment subcloning into pBluescript SK. Sequence data were obtained using either T3 or T7 primers or
synthetic oligonucleotides as primers. The sequences of both strands
of the 2.54-kb *ClaI* fragment were determined. All sequence data were
obtained by the United States Biochemical Corporation Custom
Sequencing Service.

**Genetic Procedures and the Determination of ECA and O8-Anti-
gen—** The procedure used for P1-transduction has been described
previously (12). Transformation was carried out as described by
Maniatis et al. (17). The occurrence of nonradiolabeled ECA was
determined by colony immunoblot (21) and passive hemagglutination
(12) assays. The presence of O8-side chains was determined by sen-
sitivity to phage Ω8 (12).

**In Vivo Incorporation of \[^3H\]GlcNAc into ECA and Analysis of**
Radioactive ECA by SDS-PAGE and Fluorography—The *in vivo*
incorporation of exogenously supplied \[^3H\]GlcNAc into ECA in the
presence of various concentrations of tunicamycin was analyzed by
SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described previously (10). Briefly,
cultures of strain CA10 and transformants of strain CA10 containing
pRL100 were grown with vigorous aeration at 37 °C in medium A
containing various concentrations of tunicamycin as indicated (Fig.
5). Cultures were grown to an absorbance (600 nm) of 0.6. \[^3H\]
GlcNAc was then added to portions of each culture (10 ml) and
shaking was continued for an additional 30 min. Labeling was ter-
minated by pouring the cultures into a flask containing 10 g of crushed
ice and 1 ml each of 0.2% chloramphenicol, 2% sodium azide, and 0.1
M 2,4-dinitrophenol. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation
(10 min, 12,000 × *g*, 4 °C), and cell envelopes were isolated as
previously described (9). The cell envelopes were subsequently ana-
lyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (9). Electrophoresis was car-
ried out using 12% gels according to Laemmli (22).

**Assay Procedure for the in Vitro Synthesis of Lipid I—** Assay
procedures for the *in vitro* synthesis of \[^3H\]GlcNAc-labeled lipid I
were as previously described (9). The amount of \[^3H\]GlcNAc-labeled
lipid I in reaction mixtures was determined by ascending paper
chromatography using Whatman SG-81 paper. SG-81 papers were
pretreated by dipping them in EDTA (0.068 M, pH 7.7) and allowing
them to dry at room temperature. The EDTA-treated papers were
incubated at 110 °C for 10 min immediately prior to use. Chromato-
grams were developed with chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/
v/v). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (23).

**Computer Methods—** Hydrophilicity and secondary structure anal-
yses were analyzed according to the methods Kyte and Doolittle (24)
and Chou and Fasman (25), respectively, using the Protylze Protein
Structure Predictor software package (Scientific and Educational
Software). Primary sequence comparisons were analyzed by the Best-
fit program from the Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis
package using a gap weight of 3.000 and a length weight of 0.1000.


**RESULTS**

**Isolation of a Cosmid Clone Containing the *E. coli rfe-rff***
Gene Cluster—*E. coli* strains 21546 (*rffC::Tn10*), 21548
(*rfe::Tn10*), and 21550 (*rffA::Tn10*) were used as recipients in
transduction with an *E. coli* cosmid bank prepared with vector
pHC79. A total of 658 ampicillin-resistant clones were
screened for their ability to synthesize ECA using colony
immunoblot and passive hemagglutination assays. Of these,
177 were derived from strain 21546, 190 were derived from
strain 21548, and 291 were derived from strain 21550. One of
the clones derived from strain 21546 was found to give a
strong positive reaction for the presence of ECA as determined
by both of the above assays. The cosmid pCA11 was isolated
from this clone, and it was found to complement the defects
in ECA synthesis in all of the ECA-negative Tn10-insertion
mutants (*rfe* and *rffA, C,D,E,M*) derived from strain AB1133
(Table I) as well as the defect in ECA synthesis in strain

**Subclones Containing *rfe* and *rff* Genes—** Subclones of pCA11 were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and they were used to transform ECA-negative strains possessing various *rff* and *rfe* mutations. Partial re-
striction maps of the individual subclones are shown in Fig.
2, and their complementation profiles are presented in Table II. Plasmid pCA25 complemented mutations in all of the *rff*
genes except those in the *rffE* and *rffD* loci. However, none
of the mutations in *rfe* genes were complemented by pCA25. Only pCA53, which contained a 2.54-kb *ClaI* fragment, was able to complement mutations in the *rfe* genes. Indeed, pCA53 was able to complement the defects in all of the *rfe* mutants, but it was unable to complement any of the mutations in *rff* genes. Plasmid pCA81 only complemented the mutation in the *rffM* gene whereas pCA32 complemented mutations in the *rffA, rffC, rffE,* and *rffD* genes. Neither of these subclones were able to complement the mutation in the *rffT* gene even though this defect was complemented by pCA25. However, the mutation in the *rffT* gene was complemented by pRL105 which possesses a 7.5-kb *BamHI-XhoI* fragment that includes the region of chromosomal DNA located between the chro-
mosomal fragments in pCA81 and pCA32. Plasmid pRL105 also complemented mutations in *rffM, rffA,* and *rffC* genes.

Plasmid pCA62 complemented mutations in *rffE* and *rffD* genes but failed to complement mutations in any of the other *rff* genes.

**Complementation of 08-Side Chain Synthesis in *rfe::Tn10-Insertion Mutants* by pCA53—** *E. coli* strains 21608 (*rfb<sub>08</sub>* *rfe::Tn10-48*) and 21609 (*rfb<sub>08</sub>* *rfe::Tn10-88*) are unable to synthesize either ECA or 08-side chains due to the *rfe* defect. Both strains were transformed with plasmid pCA53, and ampicillin-resistant transformants were subsequently analyzed for their ability to synthesize ECA and 08-side chains. ECA synthesis was determined by colony immunoblot and passive hemagglutination assays, and 08-side chain synthesis was evaluated by determining the sensitivity of the transformants to the 08-specific phage, Ω8. Plasmid pCA53 complemented the defects in both ECA and 08-side chain synthesis in transformants derived from both strains (data not shown).

**Identification and Nucleotide Sequence of the *rfe* Gene—** The nucleotide sequence of the 2.54-kb *ClaI* fragment of pCA53 was determined as an initial step toward the identification of the *rfe* gene(s) responsible for both the synthesis of ECA and 08-side chain synthesis. A partial restriction map of the fragment, and diagrams of the extent and direction of nucleotide sequencing are shown in Fig. 3. The entire nucleotide sequence of the 2.54-kb fragment was determined in both directions, and the sequence is shown in Fig. 4. The sequence data revealed two open reading frames, ORF-1 and ORF-2, located on the same strand. The termination codon of ORF-1 and the putative initiation codon for ORF-2 are separated by only 11 nucleotides. The sequence data also revealed that the two open reading frames do not occur in the same translational reading frame. Open reading frames 1 and 2 specify proteins of 257 and 348 amino acids with calculated *M<sub>r</sub>* values of 29,010 and 39,771, respectively; the putative initiation codon of ORF-1 is located 570 nucleotides downstream from the termination codon of rho (26).

Experiments were carried out to identify which of the potential open reading frames corresponded to the *rfe* gene. The 2.54-kb *ClaI* fragment possesses a unique *XmaIII* site located 37 nucleotides downstream from the termination codon of ORF-1 and 25 nucleotides downstream from the initiation codon of ORF-2. Accordingly, a 1.46-kb *ClaI-XmaIII* fragment containing ORF-1 was subcloned into compatible sites of pBR322. The resulting construct, designated pRL100, was used to transform various *rfe* mutants of *E. coli*, and the ability of the transformants to synthesize ECA and 08-side chains was determined (Table III). *E. coli* strains 21548, 21588, 21591, and 21592 are *rfe::Tn10*-insertion mutants derived from the *E. coli* K-12 strain AB1133 (13). These mutants are only defective in ECA synthesis since they lack the *rfb* genes that specify 08-side chains. The defect in ECA synthesis in these mutants was complemented by the 1.46-kb *ClaI-XmaIII* fragment as determined by passive hemagglutination

FIG. 3. Partial restriction map of the 2.54-kb $ClaI$ fragment of pCA53 and schematic representation of the sequencing strategy. The locations of ORF-1 (solid bar) and ORF-2 (open bar) were deduced from nucleotide sequencing data (see Fig. 4). The stippled bar designates the 3' terminus of the $\rho$ gene. The solid arrows indicate the direction and lengths of the regions sequenced. The complete overlapping sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al. (20) as described under "Experimental Procedures." Abbreviations: $C$, $ClaI$; $Sc$, $ScaI$; $H$, $HindIII$; $B$, $BamHI$; $N$, $NheI$; $Xm$, $XmaIII$.

assay. Strains 21608, 21609, 21610, and 21611 are $rfe::Tn10$-insertion mutants derived from $E$. coli 2443; strain 2443 is an $E$. coli K-12 strain that possesses the $rfb$ genes of $E$. coli O8 (21). Accordingly, the $rfe$ lesion in these mutants renders them defective in the synthesis of both ECA and O8-side chains. However, following the transformation of these mutants with pRL100, their ability to synthesize both ECA and O8-side chains was restored as determined by passive hemagglutination assay and sensitivity to phage 8, respectively. The $rfe$-dependent synthesis of both ECA and O8-side chains was also restored in transformants of $E$. coli F1469 ($rfe$) which belongs to the O8-serogroup (12) (Table III). Transformation of the above mutants with pBR322 alone failed to complement the defects in either ECA or O8-side chain synthesis (data not shown). These data strongly support the conclusion that ORF-1 specifies the $rfe$ gene.

Relationship between the $rfe$ Gene and UDP-GlcNAc: Undecaprenylphosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate Transferase Activity—Previous investigations revealed that ECA-negative $rfe::Tn10$-insertion mutants of $E$. coli are defective in lipid I synthesis (13). These observations suggest the possibility that the $rfe$ gene specifies the UDP-GlcNAc: undecaprenylphosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase responsible for lipid I synthesis. Accordingly, experiments were carried out to determine if the 1.46-kb $ClaI-XmaIII$ fragment containing ORF-1 restored the ability of $rfe::Tn10$-insertion mutants to synthesize lipid I in vitro.

Significant synthesis of radioactive lipid I was observed when cell envelope membranes obtained from $rfe::Tn10$-insertion mutants transformed with pRL100 were incubated with UDP-[³H]GlcNAc (Table IV). Indeed, the amount of in vitro lipid I synthesis using cell envelope membranes from the transformants was markedly elevated in comparison to that observed using membranes from the parental strain, $E$. coli AB1133. Essentially no radioactive lipid I synthesis was detected when reaction mixtures contained membranes obtained from the $rfe::Tn10$-insertion mutants transformed with the vector pBR322.

Sensitivity of ECA Synthesis to Tunicamycin in $rfe$ Mutants Transformed with pRL100—The above data suggest that ORF-1 is the structural gene for the UDP-GlcNAc:undecaprenyl phosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase. Thus,

additional experiments were conducted to examine this possibility. The synthesis of ECA is inhibited by the antibiotic tunicamycin due to the sensitivity of the GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase to the drug (9, 10). Therefore, synthesis of ECA by cells harboring a cloned gene encoding the GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase should exhibit increased resistance to tunicamycin in comparison to wild-type cells. Accordingly, the in vivo synthesis of ECA was abolished when tunicamycin was added to cultures to give a final concentration of 3 μg/ml (Fig. 5A). These results are in agreement with previous observations regarding the in vivo sensitivity of ECA synthesis to tunicamycin (10). In contrast, the in vivo synthesis of ECA by transformants that possessed pRL100 was unaffected by tunicamycin up to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml which was the highest concentration of the drug administered (Fig. 5B).

It is interesting to note that apparent degrees of polymerization of ECA chains synthesized by the nontransformed strain were increased at very low concentrations of tunicamycin where inhibition was incomplete (Fig. 5A). However, the significance of this observation is not understood.

Structure of the Putative Rfe Protein—The nucleotide sequence of ORF-1 indicates the Rfe protein has a predicted $M_r$ of 29,010. Based on these data, a hydrophobic plot of Rfe was constructed according to the methods of Kyte and Doolittle (24) (Fig. 6). The hydrophobic profile of Rfe is characterized by several alternating hydrophobic-hydrophilic domains. Indeed, the Rfe protein was found to have a mean hydrophathy index of +0.94 indicating that the overall hydrophobicity of the protein is very high. The distribution of charged amino acids among hydrophilic domains is generally such that hydrophobic domains are flanked by hydrophilic domains possessing net negative and net positive charges. This charge distribution is characteristic of integral membrane proteins in which positively and negatively charged hydrophilic domains are localized on the cytoplasmic face and periplasmic face of the membrane, respectively; adjacent hydrophobic domains function as transmembrane regions.

The secondary structure of Rfe was predicted according to Chou and Fasman (25). These analyses indicated that Rfe contains relatively few α-helical regions; but rather, it is comprised primarily of β-sheet and β-turn regions. Regions of β-sheet secondary structure were particularly associated with the putative transmembrane domains. More detailed studies are clearly required in order to adequately define the topology and structure of Rfe.

A computer search of nucleotide and amino acid sequences contained in both Genbank and EMBL failed to identify any genes with significant homology to $rfe$. Nevertheless, a best-fit comparison of the amino acid sequence of Rfe with the UDP-GlcNAc:dolichylphosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferases of yeast (27) and Chinese hamster ovary cells (28, 29) revealed overall general similarities (data not shown). Indeed, the percent similarity and identity of the Rfe protein with the primary structure of the GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase from Chinese hamster ovary cells were found to be 57.5 and 23.8%, respectively. However, comparisons with the yeast and Chinese hamster ovary cell enzymes did not reveal any conserved regions with high peptide homology.

DISCUSSION

Analyses of cloned DNA fragments containing $rff$ and $rfe$ genes by both restriction mapping and complementation studies have allowed the construction of a partial map of the $rfe-rff$ region of $E$. coli K-12 (Fig. 7). The order of the genes in this region proceeding from $ilv$ toward $cyo$ was found to be

thesis in rfe mutants of E. coli. In addition, the available evidence suggests that the rfe gene may be the structural gene for the UDP-GlcNAc:undecaprenylphosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase responsible for lipid I synthesis. Thus, the synthesis of lipid I was restored in rfe mutants following their transformation with a pBR322 derivative containing only ORF-1 (pRL100). In addition, the transformants possessed increased amounts of the GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase in comparison with wild-type parental strains as indicated by (i) significantly elevated levels of GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase activity in membrane preparations, and (ii) a pronounced decrease in the sensitivity of ECA synthesis to tunicamycin in vivo. These observations most likely reflect the occurrence of multiple copies of the structural gene for the GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase in the transformants due to the copy number of the pBR322 derivative, pRL100 (32).

The primary sequence of the Rfe protein was found to be somewhat similar to that of the UDP-GlcNAc:dolichylphosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferases found in yeast cells (27) and Chinese hamster ovary cells (28, 29). However, Rfe does not contain a sequence that conforms to the putative consensus sequence for dolichol recognition found in these enzymes and other enzymes that catalyze the transfer of sugars from nucleotide sugar donors to dolichol phosphate derivatives (33). The dolichols possess a saturated α-isoprene unit, and it appears that this is a critical structural feature that is recognized by sugar transferases that utilize dolichol phosphates as substrates (33). In contrast, undecaprenols possess an unsaturated α-isoprene unit. Accordingly, the lack of a sequence in Rfe that conforms to the putative consensus sequence for dolichol recognition may reflect this difference. The possibility also exists that the rfe gene is not the structural gene for the GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase, but rather that it encodes a protein which affects activity of the transferase in some as yet unrecognized manner. Additional studies are clearly required to unequivocally establish the Rfe protein as the GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase.

The expression of rfe in mutants transformed with pRL100 clearly indicates the presence of promoter sequences of the cloned fragment located upstream from the putative initiation codon. However, these sequences have not yet been defined. In addition, the function of ORF-2 has not been established. Indeed, it is possible that its function is unrelated to either the synthesis of ECA or the assembly of ECA into the outer membrane.

The role of Rfe in O-side chain synthesis is not explained by the tentative identification of this protein as the GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase involved in lipid I synthesis. The repeat units of rfe-dependent O-side chains either lack GlcNAc completely, or they contain GlcNAc in a position that does not suggest the involvement of lipid I in their assembly. For example, the O-side chains of E. coli 08 and 09 are reported to be homopolymers of mannose that are comprised of α-(1→2) and α-(1→3)-linked mannosyl residues (34). The repeating unit of the 08-side chain is →3)-α-D-Man-(1→2)-α-D-Man-(1→ (37) whereas the repeating unit of the 09-side chain is →3)-α-D-Man-(1→2)-α-D-Man-(1→3)-α-D-Man-(1→ (38). The O-side chain of E. coli 020 also lacks GlcNAc, and this polymer is comprised of the disaccharide repeat unit →4)-α-D-Galₚ-(1→2)-α-D-Ribₗ-(1→ (34). The O-side chain of S. minnesota is comprised of a pentasaccharide repeat unit that contains GlcNAc, GalNAc, and galactose. However, the GlcNAc occurs as a branch residue (35). Accordingly, it is possible that lipid I functions in the synthesis of the above

Exponentially growing cultures of (panel A) E. coli strain CA10 and (panel B) E. coli strain CA10 transformed with plasmid pRL100 were incubated with [³H] GlcNAc for 30 min in the presence of the indicated concentrations of tunicamycin (µg/ml). Cell envelopes preparations were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography for the incorporation of radioactivity into ECA polymers. Additional details are provided under “Experimental Procedures.”

FIG. 6. Hydropathic profile and distribution of charged amino acids in the Rfe protein. Hydropathic values were calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence according to the method of Kyte and Doolittle (24) using a window of 11 amino acids. Negative hydropathic index values (above the horizontal line) indicate hydrophilicity and positive values (below the horizontal line) indicate hydrophobicity. The location of positively and negatively charged amino acids are indicated by positive and negative deflections from the horizontal line above the hydropathic profile.

O-side chains in a previously unrecognized manner. Alternatively, since the function of the Rfe protein as the GlcNAc 1-phosphate has not yet been unequivocally established, the possibility still exists that Rfe possesses a hitherto unrecognized function that affects the synthesis of both ECA and $rfe$-dependent O-side chains.
