Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly prevalent, treatment-resistant malignancy with a multifaceted molecular pathogenesis. Current evidence indicates that during hepatocarcinogenesis, two main pathogenic mechanisms prevail: (1) cirrhosis associated with hepatic regeneration after tissue damage caused by hepatitis infection, toxins (for example, alcohol or aflatoxin) or metabolic influences, and (2) mutations occurring in single or multiple oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Both mechanisms have been linked with alterations in several important cellular signaling pathways. These pathways are of interest from a therapeutic perspective, because targeting them may help to reverse, delay or prevent tumorigenesis. In this review, we explore some of the major pathways implicated in HCC. These include the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, WNT/$\beta$-catenin pathway, insulin-like growth factor pathway, hepatocyte growth factor/c-MET pathway and growth factor-regulated angiogenic signaling. We focus on the role of these pathways in hepatocarcinogenesis, how they are altered, and the consequences of these abnormalities. In addition, we also review the latest preclinical and clinical data on the rationally designed targeted agents that are now being directed against these pathways, with early evidence of success.

## Introduction

Liver cancer is the sixth most common malignancy and the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide (Parkin *et al.*, 2005). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy in adults (Pons-Renedo and Llovet, 2003). For the vast majority of patients, HCC is a late complication of chronic liver disease, and as such, is often associated with cirrhosis. The main risk factors for the development of HCC include infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis infection is believed to be the main etiologic factor in >80% of cases (Anzola, 2004). Other risk factors include excessive alcohol consumption, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, exposure to environmental carcinogens (particularly aflatoxin B) and the presence of various genetic metabolic diseases (for example, hereditary hemochromatosis, tyrosinemia and $\alpha_{1}$-antitrypsin deficiency; Llovet *et al.*, 1999; Roberts and Gores, 2005; Thomas and Abbruzzese, 2005).

One of the main reasons for the high mortality rate in patients with HCC is the lack of effective treatment options, especially for those with advanced disease. Although surgery and percutaneous ablation can achieve long-term control in some patients with early HCC, recurrence rates are high (approximately 50% at 3 years; Mulcahy, 2005). Moreover, because of the asymptomatic nature of early HCC, lack of awareness and poorly defined screening strategies, most patients (approximately 80%) present with advanced or unresectable disease (Thomas and Abbruzzese, 2005). These patients generally have a very poor prognosis and treatment options are mainly palliative. Even with treatment (such as transarterial chemoembolization, intra-arterial or systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy or hormonal therapy), the 5-year relative survival rate for patients with HCC is only 7%, and very few patients with symptomatic disease survive for >1 year (Bosch *et al.*, 2004). The paucity of effective and well-tolerated treatments for advanced HCC (Simonetti *et al.*, 1997; Zhu, 2006) highlights the need for new therapeutic approaches.

In recent years, improved knowledge of oncogenic processes and the signaling pathways that regulate tumor cell proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis has led to the identification of several possible therapeutic targets that have driven the development of molecularly targeted therapies. These drugs, which act directly on components of the signaling pathways regulating tumorigenesis, have showed clinical benefit in patients with various tumor types, including

colorectal, renal, breast and lung cancers, and more recently, HCC. Because many of the pathways are implicated in the pathogenesis of various tumor types, targeted agents seem to be effective in more than one malignancy. Here we review several major molecular signaling pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of HCC. In addition, we explore the rationale for targeting molecular components of these signaling pathways, describe the preclinical activity of targeted therapies currently in development and approved for HCC, and briefly review the evidence for their clinical activity in patients with HCC.

### Search strategy and selection criteria

Data on the molecular drivers of HCC were identified for this review by searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, ISI and PubMed. Only papers published in English from 1987 to 2010 were assessed. Recent (2006–2010) abstracts and reports from meetings were also included if relevant. In addition, the clinicaltrials.gov website was used to identify studies of agents of potential interest in HCC.

### Signaling transduction pathways implicated in HCC

HCC has a very complex molecular pathogenesis in which two mechanisms predominate: (1) cirrhosis associated with hepatic regeneration after tissue damage caused by hepatitis infection, toxin/environmental factors (for example, alcohol or aflatoxin B) or metabolic influences (for example, insulin resistance, obesity, type II diabetes or dyslipidemia in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-induced HCC; Bugianesi, 2005); and (2) mutations occurring in one or more oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (Figure 1) (Thorgeirsson and Grisham, 2002; Wang *et al.*, 2002; Feitelson *et al.*, 2004; Marotta *et al.*, 2004; Villanueva *et al.*, 2007, 2008). Both of these mechanisms have been associated with abnormalities in several critical cell signaling pathways that perpetuate the carcinogenic process. These signaling cascades are of interest from a therapeutic perspective, because targeting them may help to reverse, delay or prevent hepatocarcinogenesis. In this respect, growth factor-mediated angiogenic signaling (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-MET), and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and WNT/β-catenin pathways are among the most important (Figure 2).

#### Receptor tyrosine kinases and growth factor-mediated angiogenic signaling

The liver is a highly vascular organ that depends on effective angiogenesis for cellular regeneration. Similarly, tumor growth, vascular invasion (the hallmark of invasive disease) and metastasis are also critically dependent on efficient angiogenesis (Semela and Dufour, 2004). In HCC, angiogenesis relies on autocrine and paracrine interactions between tumor cells, vascular endothelial cells and pericytes (Figure 3) (Folkman, 2003; Roberts and Gores, 2006). During the angiogenic process, the existing microvasculature is destabilized, leading to vascular hyperpermeability, remodeling of the cellular matrix and activation of endothelial cells (Papetti and Herman, 2002). Once activated, endothelial cells proliferate, migrate and undergo cord formation to form new microvessels (Papetti and Herman, 2002). Finally, pericytes are activated and recruited to stabilize the new blood vessels.

Normal angiogenesis is maintained by the balance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors (Semela and Dufour, 2004). The angiogenic balance is disturbed in HCC as tumor cells, endothelial cells and pericytes secrete a net excess of angiogenic factors, which support the recruitment and activation of endothelial cells and pericytes. A number of angiogenic growth factors, including VEGF-A, angiopoietin-2 and PDGF, have been shown to be upregulated in HCC tumors at the level of gene expression and at the plasma protein level in patients with HCC compared with cirrhotic patients (Mas *et al.*, 2007). The principal angiogenic factors involved are VEGFs, PDGFs, placental growth factors, transforming growth factor (TGF)-α and -β, basic fibroblast growth factor, EGF, HGF, angiopoietins and interleukin-4 and -8 (Folkman, 2003; Semela and Dufour, 2004). These growth factors and cytokines induce angiogenic signaling through a variety of mechanisms, including activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathways (Roberts and Gores, 2005).

#### VEGF receptor signaling

One of the most intensely studied growth factors involved in angiogenesis is VEGF. Studies of human tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice showed that neutralization of VEGF inhibited tumor growth and decreased blood vessel density in a variety of tumor types (Kim *et al.*, 1993). Overexpression of VEGF may be induced by the hypoxic tumor environment (mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 2-α), activation of EGF receptor (EGFR) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 signaling (Avila *et al.*, 2006; Bangoura *et al.*, 2007). Increased expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors (VEGFRs; which include VEGFR-1, -2 and -3) has been observed in HCC cell lines and tissues, as well as in the serum of patients with HCC (Shimamura *et al.*, 2000; Ng *et al.*, 2001; Dhar *et al.*, 2002; Poon *et al.*, 2004a). The hepatitis B x antigen has also been associated with the upregulation of VEGFR-3 (Lian *et al.*, 2007). Furthermore, increased VEGF expression has been reported in cirrhotic and dysplastic liver tissue, suggesting a possible role for VEGF-mediated angiogenesis in hepatocarcinogenesis (El-Assal *et al.*, 1998).

Clearly has an important regulatory role in HCC; high levels of VEGF expression have been linked with HCC tumor grade (Yamaguchi *et al.*, 1998), poor outcome after resection (Poon *et al.*, 2004b), disease recurrence, poor disease-free and overall survival (OS) (Chao *et al.*, 2003), vascular invasion (Li *et al.*, 1998) and portal vein emboli (Zhou *et al.*, 2000).

**EGFR, IGF and HGF/c-MET signaling**

Although the role of VEGF/VEGFR in HCC has gained more supportive evidence, the relevance of EGFR signaling in HCC is still debatable. Despite the

high frequency (60–80%) of EGFR expression in HCC, EGFR mutation in exons 18–21 is not detected (Su *et al.*, 2006) or rare ($\leq 1\%$) (Wellcome Trust, 2008). However, the elevated expression of TGF-$\alpha$ reported in preneoplastic HCC (Feitelson *et al.*, 2004) and as a ligand of the EGFR may indicate a role for EGFR signaling during early HCC.

The IGF signaling pathway is activated by binding of the ligands (IGF-1 and -2) to the membrane-bound receptor (IGF-1R) (Alexia *et al.*, 2004). IGF-1R signaling regulates several cellular processes, including proliferation, motility and inhibition of apoptosis. Moreover, expression of IGF-1R is a key regulator for anchorage-independent growth. Ligand binding to Oncogene

IGF-1R triggers rapid receptor autophosphorylation, followed by phosphorylation of intracellular targets (mainly insulin receptor substrates 1–4), which in turn initiates downstream cellular effectors, ultimately leading to activation of PI3K, protein kinase B and the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (Pollak et al., 2004). In HCC, dysregulation of IGF signaling occurs predominantly at the level of IGF-2 bioavailability. IGF-2 is upregulated by epigenetic mechanisms after an inflammatory response to liver damage or viral transactivation, altered methylation of the IGF-2 gene, inactivation of the P1 promoter or activation of the P3 promoter (Feitelson et al., 2004). IGF-2 is overexpressed in 16–40% of human HCCs (Cariani et al., 1988), and IGF-2R (an alternative receptor for IGF-2) is under-expressed in approximately 80% of HCCs (De Souza et al., 1995). This excess ligand availability leads to elevated receptor binding and subsequent downstream signaling through the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. In animal models of HCC, IGF-2 overexpression correlated with increased cell proliferation (Schirmacher et al., 1992), whereas inhibition of IGF-2 production in HCC cells reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis (Lund et al., 2004).

HGF is a multifunctional cytokine that has been implicated in tumor invasion in several malignancies (Matsumoto and Nakamura, 1996). The HGF ligand exerts its effect by binding the high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor c-MET, which is predominantly expressed on the surface of epithelial and endothelial cells. In addition to tissue regeneration, c-MET regulates cell proliferation, migration, survival, branching morphogenesis and angiogenesis. HGF-induced activation of c-MET leads to phosphorylation of adaptor proteins (including GRB2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) and GAB1 (GRB2-associated-binding protein 1)), which then activate downstream effector molecules (including phospholipase C, PI3K and ERK). For example, activation of c-MET leads to recruitment of the GRB2/SOS (son of sevenless) complex to the plasma membrane (Ponzetto et al., 1994).

This translocation can result in GTP-loading on RAS, which initiates a protein cascade that subsequently leads to downstream activation of ERK through RAF and MEK (Schlessinger, 2000). Presumably, other pathways downstream of RAS are also activated.

c-MET overexpression, relative to levels in peritumorous liver tissue, is observed in 20–48% of HCC samples (Boix et al., 1994; Suzuki et al., 1994; Kiss et al., 1997; Ueki et al., 1997; Tavian et al., 2000). Dysregulation of c-MET is associated with various molecular-genetic factors, and overexpression has been linked with decreased 5-year survival in patients with HCC (Ueki et al., 1997). Moreover, a c-MET-regulated expression signature defines a subset of HCC in humans; these patients have a poor prognosis and an aggressive phenotype (Kaposi-Novak et al., 2006).

The ERK/MAPK pathway

The ERK/MAPK pathway (also known as the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway) is a ubiquitous signal transduction pathway that regulates crucial cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis and survival (Gollob et al., 2006). Importantly, the overexpression or activation of components of this pathway is believed to contribute to tumorigenesis, tumor progression and disease metastasis in a variety of solid tumors (Leicht et al., 2007). The ERK/MAPK pathway lies downstream of the various growth factors described above, and is thus a valid therapeutic target in HCC. Growth-factor binding results in receptor phosphorylation, which activates an adapter molecule complex known as GRB2/SHC/SOS. This in turn activates the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, which triggers a cascade of specific phosphorylation events (Avila et al., 2006). Within the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, the small GTPase RAS and the serine/threonine kinase RAF (of which there are three main isoforms—ARAF, BRAF and CRAF) are the key molecular signal regulators (Kolch, 2000; Avila et al., 2006). Intermediate signaling is regulated by the mitogen/extracellular protein kinase kinases MEK1 and MEK2, which are responsible for phosphorylating and activating the final downstream

signaling molecules extracellular-regulated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (Roberts and Gores, 2005; Avila et al., 2006). ERK1/2 regulate cellular activity by acting on more than 100 substrates in the cytoplasm and nucleus, including indirect inducers of gene expression, transcription factors and cell cycle-related kinases (Kolch, 2000; Schulze et al., 2001; Xaus et al., 2001; Sananbenesi et al., 2002; Halaschek-Wiener et al., 2004). Importantly, RAS also has a regulatory role in other signaling pathways, most notably the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, the phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway and the RALGDS (ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator) pathway (To et al., 2005; Harden and Sondek, 2006).

In HCC, the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is constitutively activated, suggesting a possible role for this pathway in tumorigenesis. Hwang et al. (2004) reported overexpression of CRAF in 100% of 30 HCC tissue specimens tested, and concluded that CRAF activation may have an important role in HCC. Furthermore, after immunohistochemical evaluation of tissue samples, there was an approximately sevenfold increase in MEK1/2 phosphorylation in HCC tissues, compared with that in adjacent benign liver tissues (Huynh et al., 2003). The MAPK negative regulatory proteins RKIP (phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1) and the Sprouty (Spry)/Spred proteins are downregulated in HCC tumors, and this decrease is postulated to have a role in the excessive activation of the MAPK pathway observed in HCC (Schuierer et al., 2006; Yoshida et al., 2006). Other studies using *in vivo* HCC models and human HCC tissue specimens have shown an increase in the expression and activity of signaling intermediates, such as phosphorylated ERK, compared with surrounding liver tissue (McKillop et al., 1997; Ito et al., 1998; Feng et al., 2001). In terms of the clinical relevance of RAF/MEK/ERK activation, MAPK/ERK activity was shown to correlate positively with tumor size, but not with HCC stage or the degree of differentiation in a histopathological investigation of 26 human HCC tissue samples (Ito et al., 1998). In a more recent immunohistochemical study of tumor samples taken from 208 patients with HCC who underwent resection or liver transplantation, ERK1/2 activation was shown to be associated with aggressive tumor behavior (Schmitz et al., 2008). More importantly, ERK1/2 activation was also shown to be an independent prognostic marker for decreased OS.

Activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in solid tumors usually occurs by one of two main mechanisms. The first is through oncogenic mutations within the RAS gene, which lead to constitutive pathway activation through CRAF (Gollob et al., 2006). Mutation of the NRAS gene has been reported in up to 30% of HCC tumors (Scharovsky et al., 2000; Downward, 2003); however, the COSMIC (Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database suggests that this figure is closer to 4%, with KRAS being mutated in another 6% of cases (Wellcome Trust, 2008). Mutations within the BRAF gene are extremely rare in HCC; only two are described on the COSMIC website (Tannapfel et al., 2003). The second main mechanism for activating the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is constitutive CRAF activation resulting from dysregulated overexpression of growth factors and their receptors (Gollob et al., 2006). Finally, the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway has been reported to be activated through HBV infection in HCC. During chronic infection, HBV integrates into host DNA and expresses two transcriptional activators, both of which trigger activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (Stockl et al., 2003). The first activator, HBX protein, interacts with PIN1 (also overexpressed in HCC) (Pang et al., 2007), which may enhance activation of the MAPK pathway through dephosphorylation of CRAF, promoting its activation by RAS (Dougherty et al., 2005), whereas the second activator, PreS2-activator large surface protein, activates the pathway through a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism (Stockl et al., 2003). Note that we have previously shown that when CRAF is activated downstream of protein kinase C, it occurs in a RAS-dependent manner (Marais et al., 1998) and hence it seems likely that CRAF activation downstream of protein kinase C in HCC cells is also RAS dependent. HCV may also activate RAF kinase through its core protein (Aoki et al., 2000).

### PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway

Constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway has been firmly established as a major determinant of tumor cell growth and survival in a multitude of solid tumors (Chen et al., 2005). In the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, binding of growth factors (most notably IGF and EGF) to their receptors activates PI3K (Avila et al., 2006). PI3K subsequently produces the lipid second messenger PIP₃ (phosphoinositoltriphosphate), which in turn activates the serine/threonine kinase AKT. In addition to regulating various transcription factors (for example, FOXO (mammalian forkhead members of the class O)) (Greer and Brunet, 2005), activated AKT also phosphorylates several cytoplasmic proteins, most notably mTOR and BCL-2-associated death promoter (BAD; Avila et al., 2006). The activation of mTOR increases cellular proliferation, and inactivation of BAD decreases apoptosis and increases cell survival (Roberts and Gores, 2005). In normal tissue, this pathway is negatively regulated by the phosphatase and tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which targets the lipid products of PI3K for dephosphorylation (Roberts and Gores, 2005).

The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway can be overactivated by enhanced stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly the IGF receptor and EGFR. Expression of both IGF and IGF receptor is upregulated in HCC and human cirrhotic liver (Alexia et al., 2004), resulting in stimulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, in addition to activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK and WNT/β-catenin pathways (Desbois-Mouthon et al., 2001; Alexia et al., 2004).

Similarly, EGF and related growth factors are commonly overexpressed in HCC (Yeh et al., 1987; Carlin et al., 1988; Kira et al., 1997; Ito et al., 2001). Evidence also suggests that anomalies in PTEN function may lead to overactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in HCC. The PTEN gene is mutated in 5% of HCCs (Wellcome Trust, 2008), is frequently deleted, and its expression is reduced in nearly half of all HCC tumors, resulting in constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (Hu et al., 2003). In addition, PTEN expression can be downregulated directly by the HBX protein in HBV-infected patients (Feitelson et al., 2004). Importantly, downregulation of PTEN expression has been shown to correlate with increased tumor grade, advanced disease stage and reduced OS in patients with HCC (Hu et al., 2003). In a transgenic hepatocyte-specific, PTEN-deficient mouse model, the livers of 40-week-old PTEN-deficient mice revealed the macrovesicular steatosis, ballooning hepatocytes, lobular inflammatory cell infiltration and perisinusoidal fibrosis that are characteristic of human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; by 80 weeks of age, 100% of PTEN-deficient mouse livers showed adenomas and 66% of the mice had HCC (Watanabe et al., 2005). AKT phosphorylation has been implicated in early HCC recurrence and poor prognosis (Nakanishi et al., 2005), and a recent microarray study found that 23% of HCC patients had elevated levels of AKT phosphorylation on Ser473 (Boyault et al., 2007). There is also some evidence suggesting that PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling may be activated by somatic mutations in the PI3K catalytic α gene PIK3CA, which encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K. In one study, somatic PIK3CA mutations were detected in 26 of 73 (35.6%) HCC specimens tested (Lee et al., 2005), whereas much lower frequencies have been reported in studies from other geographic regions (Tanaka et al., 2006; Boyault et al., 2007).

More recently, Villanueva et al. (2008) performed an analysis of integrative genomic data derived from a large cohort of human tissue samples (314 from HCC tumoral tissue and 37 from nontumoral tissue). Assessments included direct-sequencing mutation analysis, a single-nucleotide polymorphism array to detect DNA copy number changes, real-time PCR and gene expression microarray to detect mRNA levels and immunostaining to detect protein activation. Dual blockade of mTOR signaling was achieved using a rapamycin analog (everolimus) and an EGFR/VEGFR inhibitor, and the effects of this blockade were evaluated in HCC cell lines and in a tumor xenograft model. Aberrant mTOR signaling was observed with activation of either the IGF and/or EGF cascade. mTOR blockade with everolimus slowed tumor growth and increased survival in the HCC xenograft model, an effect that was enhanced in vivo with EGFR/VEGFR blockade. These results add considerably to the body of research suggesting that mTOR pathway activation has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HCC.

Taken together, these data suggest that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has a critical role in the pathogenesis of HCC. Indeed, levels of the phosphorylated form of mTOR have been shown to be elevated in 15% of cases of HCC, and levels of total p70 S6 kinase (the immediate substrate for phosphorylated mTOR) have been shown to be increased in 45% of cases (Sahin et al., 2004).

### The WNT/β-catenin pathway

A major and early carcinogenic event in the development of HCC seems to be the abnormal regulation of the transcription factor β-catenin, a key component of the WNT signaling pathway (De La et al., 1998). In the normal state, the binding of members of a family of soluble cysteine-rich glycoprotein ligands, the WNTs, to members of the Frizzled family of cell-surface receptors results in the activation of the WNT signaling pathway (Avila et al., 2006). Receptor binding activates DSH (downstream effector Dishevelled), which consequently prevents phosphorylation of β-catenin by glycogen synthase kinase-3β and its subsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. An ensuing increase in the cytoplasmic concentrations of β-catenin results in its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Avila et al., 2006). Once in the nucleus, β-catenin acts as a co-activator to stimulate the transcription of genes and expression of gene products involved in cell proliferation (for example, MYC, MYB, CJUN and CYCD1), angiogenesis, antiapoptosis and the formation of extracellular matrix (Avila et al., 2006).

According to the COSMIC database, β-catenin is mutated in 17% of HCCs, with sites of mutation including those phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (which regulates degradation of β-catenin)—an early event in HCC. It has also been reported that in 12–26% of HCCs, β-catenin accumulation and stabilization results from mutations in the β-catenin gene, and in 8–13% of cases it results from mutations in the genes that activate β-catenin signaling (Giles et al., 2003). In either case, these mutations seem to be particularly common in HCCs associated with chronic HCV infection (Giles et al., 2003). In HCC, approximately 50–70% of tumors have increased levels of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Wong et al., 2001). This accumulation of β-catenin provides a growth advantage to tumor cells by promoting proliferation and suppressing differentiation. β-catenin accumulation alone, however, does not seem to cause progression to HCC from a nonmalignant state. Studies with β-catenin transgenic mouse models indicate that abnormal WNT signaling can cause severe hepatomegaly, but is not sufficient for carcinogenic transformation (Giles et al., 2003). Interestingly, targeted disruption of the Iqgap2 gene in mice leads to the development of HCC, which is associated with Iqgap1 overexpression and the activation of β-catenin and cyclin D1. When Iqgap2-null mice were bred with Iqgap1-null mice, the HCC phenotype was reduced. This suggests that Iqgap2 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its loss can lead to β-catenin activation and the development of HCC, and it further implicates β-catenin as a key driver of HCC (Schmidt et al., 2008).

Direct mutation of β-catenin is not the only route through which the WNT pathway can be aberrantly activated in HCC. Hoshida *et al.* (2009) performed an analysis of gene expression profiles from 603 HCC patients in an effort to define molecular drivers of the disease. Three subclasses of HCC were characterized, two of which showed either increased WNT pathway activity or increased MYC/AKT pathway activity. The mechanism through which WNT pathway activation may occur was determined to be mediated by TGF-β. A strong association between WNT activation and TGF-β target genes was found, and treatment of an HCC cell line with TGF-β led to activation of a β-catenin reporter construct. Given the dearth of precise information about the key molecular instigators of HCC, such classifications may aid the stratification of patients for future clinical trials of agents targeting these pathways.

Therapeutic targets in HCC

Anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapies

As previously mentioned, several studies have established that tumor growth and invasion in HCC are dependent on dysregulated angiogenesis. There is, therefore, a strong rationale for targeting growth factors that drive the angiogenic process as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HCC. VEGF is a key angiogenic factor, and several agents that target VEGF or VEGFR are currently in development for the treatment of HCC (Table 1) (Koch *et al.*, 2005; Alberts *et al.*, 2007; Malka *et al.*, 2007; Siegel *et al.*, 2008; Toh *et al.*, 2009).

Bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA) is a recombinant, humanized, anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (Presta *et al.*, 1997) that has shown encouraging early evidence of efficacy in patients with advanced HCC (Siegel *et al.*, 2008; Zhu, 2008). In two small monotherapy studies, treatment with bevacizumab 5–10 mg/kg resulted in partial response (PR) in 8–13% of patients and stable disease (SD) in 54–72% of patients (Malka *et al.*, 2007; Siegel *et al.*, 2008). The combination of bevacizumab with either cytotoxic regimens or erlotinib ((OSI-774) Tarceva; OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Melville, NY, USA) has also shown encouraging results in patients with advanced HCC in four phase II trials (Zhu *et al.*, 2006; Sun *et al.*, 2007; Thomas *et al.*, 2009; Hsu *et al.*, 2010). In one phase II trial reported by Zhu *et al.* (2006), the combination of bevacizumab plus gemcitabine and oxaliplatin showed moderate activity, with a 20% overall response rate in evaluable patients. SD was achieved in an additional 27% of patients (median duration 9 months; range 4.5–13.7 months). Median OS and median progression-free survival (PFS) were 9.6 and 5.3 months, respectively. Sun *et al.* (2007) reported the results of a phase II trial performed to evaluate bevacizumab in combination with capecitabine and oxaliplatin. Of 30 evaluable patients, 4 (13.3%) had a PR and 23 (76.6%) had SD. Median OS was 10.3 months, and the mean time to progression (TTP) was 4.5 months. In a third phase II trial performed by Hsu *et al.* (2010), the combination of bevacizumab plus capecitabine was evaluated. On the basis of data from 44 evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 9% and the disease control rate (defined in this study as

complete response [CR] + PR + SD) was 52%. In patients with the CLIP (Cancer of the Liver Italian Program) score of ≤3, median OS and median PFS were 8.2 and 3.6 months, respectively. Finally, in a single-center phase II trial reported by Thomas *et al.* (2009), the combination of bevacizumab plus erlotinib resulted in PR in 10 of 40 evaluable patients (25%), with a median PFS of 9 months and a median OS of 15.7 months.

Sunitinib (Sutent; Pfizer Labs, New York, NY, USA) is an orally administered small molecule that inhibits members of the split-kinase domain family of receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGFR-1 and -2, PDGF receptor (PDGFR)-α and -β, the stem cell factor receptor c-KIT, FLT3 (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3) kinase, RET kinase and many others (Mendel *et al.*, 2003; Chow and Eckhardt, 2007; Zhu, 2008). Preclinical studies in a variety of tumor cell lines have shown that the antiangiogenic effects of sunitinib are mediated through VEGFR and PDGFR-β (Murray *et al.*, 2003; Abrams *et al.*, 2003a, b), although the primary target of sunitinib is likely to be VEGFR-2. Two phase II studies of sunitinib in patients with advanced HCC have been undertaken. In the first study, sunitinib was administered at a dose of 37.5 mg/day (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off). One patient (out of 34) had a PR and 17 patients (50%) achieved SD for at least 12 weeks (Zhu *et al.*, 2009). Median PFS in this cohort was 3.9 months, and TTP was 4.1 months. Sunitinib treatment resulted in increased VEGF, PDGF and stromal-derived factor-1α, whereas decreases were observed in soluble VEGFR-2, soluble VEGFR-3 and circulating progenitor cells. Patients with

decreased interleukin-6 and sc-KIT after 14 days of treatment showed improved PFS and OS. In a second phase II study (sunitinib 50 mg/day for 4 weeks out of every 6), one patient (out of 37) had a confirmed PR and 35% of patients had SD as their best response (Favire *et al.*, 2009). Median OS and PFS were 8.0 and 3.7 months, respectively. However, significant toxicities, including four deaths, were observed. A low response rate and failure to meet a primary end point based on RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) led to the termination of the trial before entering the second phase. A phase III study comparing sunitinib with sorafenib was discontinued following a review by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee both because of a greater incidence of adverse events in the sunitinib group and because sunitinib failed to demonstrate that it was either superior or not inferior to sorafenib in extending OS.

Sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc., Wayne, NJ, USA) is an orally available multikinase inhibitor originally designed to target CRAF. Although sorafenib inhibits oncogenic BRAF *in vitro* and in cell lines, it does not seem to be sufficiently potent to target BRAF *in vivo* (Eisen *et al.*, 2006). Indeed, we recently demonstrated that the anti-tumor activity of sorafenib is independent of any activity that it may possess against BRAF (Whittaker *et al.*, 2010), supporting the view that sorafenib is not a BRAF inhibitor *in vivo*. However, sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of VEGFR and PDGFR, and these receptor tyrosine kinases are likely to be among its clinical targets. Consequently, there is a good rationale for testing sorafenib in HCC (Figure 4) (Wilhelm *et al.*,

2004; Carlomagno *et al.*, 2006; Lierman *et al.*, 2006; Wilhelm *et al.*, 2006). Consistent with this, preclinical evaluations suggest that the antitumor activity of sorafenib in HCC may be mediated by inhibition of angiogenesis (through inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases), although direct effects on cell proliferation and survival cannot be excluded (Wilhelm *et al.*, 2004; Liu *et al.*, 2005).

The promising preclinical activity of sorafenib has since been supported by clinical studies (Zhu, 2008). In a phase II study of 137 patients with advanced inoperable HCC, single-agent sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) induced a PR in 2% of patients, a minor response in 6% and SD lasting ≥4 months in 34% of patients (Abou-Alfa *et al.*, 2006). In this study, median TTP was 4.2 months and median OS was 9.2 months. In the pivotal, randomized phase III SHARP (Sorafenib HCC Assessment Randomized Protocol) trial, sorafenib 400 mg twice daily significantly prolonged OS compared with placebo in patients with advanced HCC (10.7 months in the sorafenib group vs 7.9 months in the placebo group; Llovet *et al.*, 2008). Median time to radiological progression was significantly longer in the sorafenib group (5.5 vs 2.8 months). Significantly, this is the first time a systemic therapy has showed a survival advantage in a phase III study in patients with HCC. In another randomized phase III study performed in the Asia-Pacific region, sorafenib also showed improved OS in patients with advanced HCC, most of whom had HBV infection as an etiologic factor (Cheng *et al.*, 2009). OS was 6.5 months in the sorafenib group compared with 4.2 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.68; *P* = 0.014). On the basis of these data, sorafenib has become the only targeted therapy approved for clinical use in several countries, including the United States (for the treatment of patients with unresectable HCC) and in Europe (for the treatment of HCC).

Recently, encouraging data emerged for the combination of sorafenib and doxorubicin. An interim analysis of a randomized phase II study found a prolonged TTP (median 8.6 months) and OS (median 13.7 months) with this combination in patients with advanced HCC (Abou-Alfa *et al.*, 2008).

Although RAS mutations are relatively rare in HCC, and RAF mutations are almost nonexistent, the importance of the MAPK pathway in HCC is highlighted by preclinical studies showing that the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 blocks growth and promotes apoptosis in primary HCC cells *in vitro*, and suppresses tumor growth in HCC xenograft models. The antitumor activity of AZD6244 correlates with levels of phosphorylated MEK (Huynh *et al.*, 2007b) and one study suggests that AZD6244 may be effectively combined with doxorubicin in patients with HCC (Huynh *et al.*, 2007a). These data suggest that CRAF drugs could also produce antitumor activity in HCC, and a recent report has highlighted the importance of CRAF in HCV viral replication, suggesting that it may also have a role in HCC tumor initiation (Himmelsbach *et al.*, 2009). Although sorafenib was designed as a CRAF inhibitor, there is no evidence to suggest that it targets CRAF in HCC tumors—rather, the data suggest that its clinical

activity is mediated through its ability to target the receptor tyrosine kinases that drive tumor neoangiogenesis and/or through ‘off-target’ effects. The availability of potent new anti-RAF drugs, such as PLX 4032 (Flaherty *et al.*, 2009) and XL281 (Schwartz *et al.*, 2009), will allow the importance of RAF as a target in HCC to be tested in preclinical models. However, care must be exercised. PLX 4032 is a highly potent BRAF drug and is unlikely to be of value in HCC because BRAF is not implicated in HCC. More importantly, BRAF-selective inhibitors cause paradoxical pathway activation in tumor cells in which RAS is mutated or activated by upstream components (Hatzivassilou *et al.*, 2010; Heidorn *et al.*, 2010; Poulikakos *et al.*, 2010). BRAF inhibitors may therefore accelerate rather than suppress the growth of some HCC tumors. Nevertheless, results with the MEK inhibitors suggest the potential value of developing pan-RAF or CRAF-specific inhibitors in HCC; possibly as prophylaxis in HCV-infected patients.

Vatalanib (PTK787) is an oral, small-molecular-weight tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits VEGFR-1 and -2 (Wood *et al.*, 2000). In a preclinical study, it significantly reduced tumor volume and microvessel density in an HCC xenograft model (Liu *et al.*, 2005). It also inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Liu *et al.*, 2005). In addition, it induced growth arrest in HCC cell lines, which was associated with cell cycle arrest at G1 and partial blockade of the G2-M checkpoint. These preclinical findings have prompted a phase I study in which vatalanib was given at either 750 or 1250 mg/day. Patients were stratified into three groups: those with mild, moderate or severe hepatic dysfunction based on total bilirubin and aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase levels. The maximum tolerated dose of PTK787 was defined as 750 mg daily. Of patients in all groups, 18 were evaluable for efficacy. No CR or PR was observed. Nine patients had a best response of SD (Koch *et al.*, 2005).

Cediranib (AZD2171) is another selective inhibitor of VEGFR-1, -2 and -3. Preclinical studies showed that cediranib inhibits the growth of a variety of human tumor xenografts, and reduces microvessel density in human lung xenografts in a dose-dependent manner (Wedge *et al.*, 2005). Given at 45 mg daily, it is currently being evaluated in a phase II trial in patients with unresectable HCC (Alberts *et al.*, 2007).

Brivanib (BMS-582664) is a dual inhibitor of VEGFR and fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathways that can induce tumor growth inhibition in mouse HCC xenograft models. A phase II study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of brivanib in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HCC who had received either no previous systemic therapy (cohort A) or one previous regimen of an angiogenesis inhibitor (cohort B) (Raoul *et al.*, 2009). The treatment schedule consisted of continuous daily dosing of brivanib 800 mg. Of the 96 patients enrolled, 55 were in cohort A and 41 (including 38 in whom sorafenib had failed) in cohort B. In cohort A, median OS was 10 months and median TTP was 2.8 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4–3.9). PR was observed in

5% of patients and the disease control rate was 47%. Brivanib is undergoing additional evaluation in phase III studies in both the first-line setting in comparison with sorafenib and in the sorafenib-refractory setting in comparison with best supportive care in advanced HCC.

Linifanib (ABT-869) is a novel receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against members of the VEGFR and PDGFR families (Albert *et al.*, 2006). Although not a general antiproliferative agent, it can reduce cell growth and increase apoptosis in tumors with FLT3-dependent proliferation. Preliminary results from an open-label, multicenter, phase II study of linifanib in advanced HCC have been reported (Toh *et al.*, 2009). Linifanib 0.25 mg/kg was administered daily to patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis and once every other day to those with Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity. Of the 44 patients enrolled, 34 (28 with Child-Pugh class A and 6 with Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis) were available for analysis. The estimated response rate was 8.7% (95% CI 1.1–28) for the 23 patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis. For all 34 patients, median TTP was 112 days (95% CI 110–not estimable), median PFS was 112 days (95% CI 61–168) and median OS was 295 days (95% CI 182–333).

### Anti-EGF/EGFR therapies

Ligands that bind to the EGFR, such as EGF, have a vital role in both tumor angiogenesis and proliferation, thought to be primarily through activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Because of their efficacy in other solid tumors and the integral role of growth factors in HCC development and progression, it was hypothesized that agents specifically targeting EGF/EGFR signaling may also be beneficial in HCC. These agents include the tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib, lapatinib and gefitinib, and the monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Because of their promising activity in other tumor types and the rationale for targeting EGFR in HCC, these agents have also been tested in HCC.

Erlotinib is an orally active, low-molecular-weight drug that acts as a potent and reversible inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (Grunwald and Hidalgo, 2003). In an *in vitro* study, it was shown to potently suppress the growth of human EGFR-expressing HCC cell lines (Huh-7 and HepG2) in a dose-dependent manner by inducing both apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G1/S-transition (Huether *et al.*, 2005). In a subsequent study, it was shown to inhibit the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and block signal transducer and activator of transcription-mediated signaling in Huh-7 and HepG2 cells (Huether *et al.*, 2006). These actions resulted in overexpression of proapoptotic factors and downregulation of antiapoptotic factors (for example, BCL-2, BCL-XL and JUN D) and cell cycle-regulating genes that induce G1/G0 arrest. Preliminary antitumor activity has been reported in a phase II study of 38 patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC (Philip *et al.*, 2005). Daily administration of erlotinib

150 mg induced a PR in 9% of patients (*n* = 3) and a disease control rate (tumor response or SD ≥ 8 weeks) of 59%. In all, 12 patients (32%) were progression free at 24 weeks, and median OS was 13 months. In a report by Thomas *et al.* (2009), 17 out of 40 patients (43%) with unresectable HCC achieved PFS after 16 weeks of treatment with erlotinib 150 mg daily; at 24 weeks, PFS was 28%. No complete or partial responses were observed. The median time to failure (defined as either disease progression or death) was 13.3 weeks. The median OS was 25 weeks (95% CI 17.9–42.3) after initiation of erlotinib therapy. The phase III placebo-controlled, double-blind SEARCH (Sorafenib and Erlotinib, a Randomized Trial Protocol for the Treatment of Patients with HCC) trial, which is being conducted in patients with advanced HCC and underlying Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis, seeks to determine whether the OS observed with sorafenib in advanced HCC can be improved by combining sorafenib with erlotinib to achieve combined inhibition of the EGF, VEGF and RAS/RAF/MEK signaling pathways.

Lapatinib (GW572016) is an oral dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets both EGFR and the human EGFR-2 (HER-2) (Johnston and Leary, 2006). Phase II results indicate that lapatinib is well tolerated and shows preliminary evidence of antitumor activity in HCC (Ramanathan *et al.*, 2006). Among 40 patients with advanced HCC, the response rate was 5%, median PFS was 2.3 months (95% CI 1.7–5.6) and median OS was 6.2 months (95% CI 5.1–∞) (Ramanathan *et al.*, 2009).

Gefitinib ((ZD1839) Iressa; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington DE, USA) is an oral small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase drug that showed activity in HCC cell lines and animal models of HCC. In these preclinical studies, gefitinib inhibited tumor cell growth (Matsuo *et al.*, 2003; Okano *et al.*, 2006), angiogenesis (Ueda *et al.*, 2006) and intrahepatic metastasis (Matsuo *et al.*, 2003); induced apoptosis (Hopfner *et al.*, 2004) and cell cycle arrest (Hopfner *et al.*, 2004); and prevented the development of HCC in cirrhotic livers (Schiffer *et al.*, 2005). Gefitinib treatment resulted in reduced RAF/MEK/ERK, AKT and TNF-α signaling; cell cycle arrest; suppression of antiapoptotic protein expression; and stimulation of proapoptotic protein expression (Hopfner *et al.*, 2004; Okano *et al.*, 2006; Ueda *et al.*, 2006). However, these encouraging preclinical results have not been matched in clinical studies. In a phase II study of patients with advanced unresectable HCC, single-agent gefitinib 250 mg/day showed low activity (O’Dwyer *et al.*, 2006). Of 31 patients, 1 had a PR and 7 had SD. Median PFS was 2.8 months and median OS was 6.5 months. Given these results, it is unlikely that gefitinib will be investigated further in advanced HCC, although studies are ongoing in the adjuvant setting (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

The recombinant chimeric monoclonal immunoglobulin 1 antibody cetuximab ((IMC-C225) Erbitux; ImClone LLC, New York, NY, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, USA), which targets the extracellular domain of the EGFR, is also under investigation in HCC. In an initial *in vitro* study, cetuximab inhibited

cell growth, induced cell cycle arrest and moderately increased apoptosis in p53 wild-type HepG2 cells (Huether *et al.*, 2005). However, it only had limited effects in Huh-7 cells that carried a mutated *p53* tumor suppressor gene (a common mutation in HCC). As with gefitinib, clinical results have so far been disappointing. In a phase II study of 30 patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC, cetuximab (400 mg/m² initial dose followed by 250 mg/m² given weekly) produced no CRs or PRs, and only five patients achieved SD (Zhu *et al.*, 2007). Moreover, median PFS was just 1.4 months. A further phase II study of single-agent cetuximab in 32 patients with advanced HCC (Gruenwald *et al.*, 2007) indicated only limited activity for the drug (44% SD rate and a median TTP of 2 months).

Together, these clinical trials have suggested that other than erlotinib, which may have modest activity against HCC, EGFR inhibitors do not have promising activity in HCC. Whether EGFR inhibitors may augment the antitumor activity of other targeted or chemotherapeutic agents remains to be examined in future clinical trials.

### Miscellaneous therapies

Activation of the IGF signaling pathway induces potent proliferative and antiapoptotic effects; molecular components of this pathway may represent valid targets for therapeutic intervention. Indeed, blockade of IGF-1R activity through anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies can induce growth inhibition, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in HCC cells (Hopfner *et al.*, 2006; Zhang *et al.*, 2006). IMC-A12, a monoclonal antibody directed at IGF-1R, has been shown to downregulate IGF-1R levels and inhibit downstream signaling in solid tumors (Burtrum *et al.*, 2003; Wu *et al.*, 2005). On the basis of these results, clinical trials are currently under way to assess the efficacy of IMC-A12 in liver cancer (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

The high proportion of HCC tumors expressing c-MET has also led to the study of agents that may target this molecular pathway. Two small-molecule inhibitors of c-MET, PHA665752 and SU11274, have shown inhibition of cancer cell growth *in vitro* (Ma *et al.*, 2005a, b), and in preclinical studies, a monoclonal antibody to the β-chain of HGF seems to completely inhibit HGF-mediated activities (Burgess *et al.*, 2006). Notably, c-MET can be activated downstream of the receptor tyrosine kinases in other cancers (Huang *et al.*, 2007), suggesting that this kinase could be an important target in many cancers. Further studies of c-MET-targeted therapies will be needed to determine whether the targeting of MET signaling will have clinical activity in patients with HCC.

In an *in vitro* study (Sieghart *et al.*, 2007), the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (RAD001) showed marked antiproliferative activity when applied as a single agent to Hep3B and SNU398 HCC cells. The drug also had a chemosensitizing effect when applied in combination with doxorubicin. In a separate study, the activity of another mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus, was investigated in a tumor xenograft model of HCC (Semela *et al.*, 2007).

mTOR inhibition with sirolimus significantly reduced HCC growth and improved survival compared with no treatment. The antitumor activity of sirolimus was attributed primarily to its antiangiogenic effects. A study by Kneteman *et al.* (2004) indicated that a sirolimus-based immunosuppression protocol seems to have beneficial effects on tumor recurrence and survival and an acceptable rate of rejection and toxicity in liver transplant patients, with extended criteria for HCC. Further evaluation is warranted, and both everolimus and temsirolimus are undergoing early-phase clinical development in patients with HCC.

### Conclusions and future directions

Advanced HCC is a notoriously difficult disease to treat. Currently, sorafenib is the only effective systemic treatment option available. In recent years, research has focused on uncovering the cellular signaling mechanisms that underlie HCC. Genetic alterations clearly have a major role in hepatocarcinogenesis, and abnormalities in several critical molecular signaling pathways have been identified as contributing to tumor development and progression. These pathways include the MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, WNT/β-catenin and IGF pathways, and growth factor-regulated angiogenic signaling. Evidently, a high dependency on angiogenesis is an exploitable feature for the treatment of HCC.

Importantly, HCC clearly has a complex pathogenesis, with the potential for considerable crosstalk and redundancy in signaling pathways, and hence targeting single molecules or pathways may have a limited benefit in treatment. Use of combinations of therapies may be needed to overcome the complex network of signaling pathways, and ultimately inhibit the signaling that controls tumor growth and survival. However, use of a combination regimen can lead to tolerability and drug-drug interaction problems, and hence an alternative approach is to use molecularly targeted agents that have multiple modes of action, targeting several signaling pathways concurrently. As described above, both sorafenib and sunitinib are multitargeted agents that inhibit several kinases. It is unclear whether their clinical efficacy is due to their broad specificity or their targeting of a single, as-yet-unidentified, protein. However, as kinase inhibitors become more and more selective, it will be possible to test which targets are important in specific diseases. Unfortunately, at present there are no approved drugs to effectively target the WNT/β-catenin pathway, which clearly has an important role in the pathogenesis of HCC. These drugs are eagerly awaited.

These issues point to the important role that increased knowledge of the molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of HCC will have in guiding the development of effective, rationally designed therapeutic approaches. Currently, a plethora of kinase inhibitors and antibodies directed against specific molecular targets are being investigated in HCC. Agents that target angiogenesis pathways seem to offer the most promise, but further research dissecting the molecular mechanisms

mediating both the clinical benefits and escape or resistance is needed. Clearly, the efficacy of these agents must be balanced with toxicity in this highly compromised patient population. Nevertheless, the approval and wide use of sorafenib for the treatment of HCC has shown the potential of targeting the molecular pathways involved in HCC, and offers hope that other effective therapies will ultimately be developed.
