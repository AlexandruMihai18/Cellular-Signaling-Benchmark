## SUMMARY

**Objectives:** The pharmacologic approach to disease management has not (as of yet) demonstrated safety and efficacy in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The current article introduces the long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-ω3s), and reviews the evidence and mechanisms by which their increased intake or supplementation may ameliorate NAFLD.

**Methods:** A literature search was performed through Ovid Medline, using such terms as NAFLD, NASH, nonalcoholic, steatosis, polyunsaturated fatty acids, fish oil and omega-3.

**Results:** The LC-ω3s display pleiotropic properties that are of benefit in cardiovascular disease. Deficiency of omega-3 fatty acids results in hepatic steatosis, whereas fish oil displays powerful hypotriglyceridemic properties. Intake and/or metabolism of omega-3 fatty acids are commonly impaired in NAFLD patients. A number of pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated an ameliorative effect of supplemental fish oil, seal oil and purified LC-ω3s in reducing hepatic lipid content in NAFLD. There is less evidence that hepatic inflammation and fibrosis are safely reduced by LC-ω3s.

**Conclusions:** Supplementation of LC-ω3s appears to safely reduce nutritional hepatic steatosis in adults. Whether other histopathologic features of NAFLD also respond to LC-ω3s is being addressed by clinical trials. Any recommendation for omega-3 supplementation in NAFLD/NASH is contingent on these results.

## 1. Introduction

The fatty acid (FA) and triglyceride (TG) content of hepatocytes reflects the balance between their uptake and synthesis and between their oxidation and export (Fig. 1). Pathologic accumulation of fat in hepatocytes that cannot be attributed to alcohol consumption is most commonly encountered in the context of

Insulin Resistance (IR) and visceral obesity, and referred to as Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). NAFLD comprises a spectrum of liver diseases ranging from simple steatosis (nonalcoholic fatty liver, NAFL), to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to cirrhosis. According to the “two-hit” hypothesis of NAFLD etiopathogenesis, IR and visceral obesity incrementally increase the intrahepatic TG (IHTG) content, culminating in NAFL—a relatively benign condition. In a minority of patients, however, a second hit in the form of oxidative stress and inflammation ensues, fueling cell damage and fibrosis (NASH). NAFLD is emerging as a formidable health burden and an increasingly common cause of cirrhosis. Yet, other than weight loss, a safe and effective intervention to prevent disease onset and progression is lacking. The epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of NAFLD have been reviewed elsewhere.<sup>1,2</sup> The present article is a review of the evidence and mechanisms by which increased intake or supplementation with LC-ω3s may ameliorate NAFLD.

Fig. 1. Physiologic handling of lipids by the hepatocyte. Endocytosis of TG-rich lipoproteins and mediated uptake of Free FAs supply hepatocytes with lipids. FA synthesis from Acetyl-CoA normally occurs postprandially, following glucose entry to the Krebs cycle. Intracellular FAs are activated to form Acetyl-CoA, and/or are chaperoned by lipid binding proteins (not shown). FAs undergo esterification — to form TGs and phospholipids (PLs)- or oxidation towards ATP synthesis- at times of nutrient sufficiency and deficiency, respectively. TGs and PLs from different sources are stored in lipid droplets or compiled with apolipoprotein B100 into VLDL particles, which supply extra-hepatic tissues with TGs in the post-absorptive period. TG: triglycerides; FA: fatty acids.

### 2. Fatty acids: nutritional, metabolic and clinical aspects

Biochemically, most fatty acids (FAs) are aliphatic (straight chain) hydrocarbons connected to a carboxyl group and are designated saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids (SatFAs, MUFAs, PUFAs) according to the presence and number of double carbon bonds. Esterification of phosphoro-glycerols with FAs produces the amphipathic phospholipids (PLs) — core structural components of lipid membranes — and neutral TGs, which coalesce anhydrously to form energy-dense droplets (Fig. 1). Hepatocytes can physiologically store TG droplets, albeit to a lesser extent than adipocytes.^[4,5]^

Mammals are capable of synthesizing the satFA, palmitic acid (C16:0), from glucose metabolites, i.e., de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Palmitic acid may be further transformed through step-wise desaturation (i.e., introduction of a double bond by removal of two hydrogens) and chain lengthening (addition of two carbons) to form certain longer and unsaturated FAs (Fig. 2). Yet rodents fed a diet deficient only in FAs develop NAFL,^[7–9]^ dermatitis, and dysfunction of several organs.^[7–10]^ Supplementing a fat-free diet with the ω-6 and/ or ω-3 PUFAs, but not other FAs, prevents and reverses hepatic steatosis^[8–11]^ and other components of the deficiency syndrome.^[8,9]^ Animals lack desaturases capable of introducing a double bond between carbons located beyond the 9th carbon from the carboxyl end of 18-carbon (or other) fatty acids. They must therefore obtain

Linoleic acid (LA, C18:2; ω-6) and Alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3; ω-3) from edible plants.^[g]^ The long chain (≥20C) PUFAs — Arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4; ω-6) Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5; ω-3), and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6; ω-3) — are provided through consumption of animal products and marine life, but may also be synthesized from their C18 counterparts through PUFA elongases and desaturases^[h]^ (Fig. 2) (Refs. 3,6,9,12). Current opinion holds that whereas C18 PUFAs are nutritionally essential (and designated essential FAs-EFAs), it is the LC-PUFAs that are biologically essential.^[9]^ Specifically, LC-PUFAs are preferentially acylated at the sn-2 position of glycerol-PLs such as PhosphatidylCholine (PC). Membrane LC-PUFAs influence the bio-physical and biochemical properties of membranes, and serve as precursors of potent, short-lived oxylipids (e.g., prostaglandins, resolvins) that modulate signal transduction between the cell membrane and the nucleus.^[9,12,13]^

Overt EFA deficiency is relatively rare,^[i]^ but insufficient intake of ω3 PUFAs and conversion of C18- to LC-ω3 PUFAs is common:

---

^g^ Note that desaturases are numerically classified according to the FA carbon they act on, counting from the carboxyl end, e.g., Δ⁹-desaturase; whereas the unsaturated FAs are numerically classified according to the first FA carbon with a double bond, counting from the methyl end (e.g., C18:3; ω-3. see Fig. 2).

^h^ Different combinations of FA synthesis, esterification, storage, oxidation, export and synthesis of LC-PUFAs are performed in several cell types, but the hepatocyte is outstanding in its dynamic and high-output performance of the whole spectrum.

^i^ EFA deficiency should be considered in patients with malabsorption and secondary NAFLD, such as in Cystic Fibrosis, Crohn’s disease, situation post bariatric surgery, and short bowel syndrome.

Fig. 2. Fatty acids are synthesized de novo and/or obtained from the diet. SREBP-1c and ChREBP (sterol/carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein) induce transcription of enzymes that catalyze FA synthesis, elongation, desaturation and esterification. Carbohydrate ingestion elicits a surge in insulin and glucose that activate, in concert, both pro-lipogenic factors. L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) promotes glycolysis to provide citrate, a substrate for palmitic acid (C16:0) synthesis. Microsomal enzymes may elongate and desaturate the latter to form stearic acid (C18:0) and unsaturated derivatives. The C18 ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs are essential FAs and must be ingested in foods. Upon intake, they may be elongated and desaturated to their long chain (C ≥ 20) counterparts – PUFAs that may also be obtained from food. Activated PPAR-α also induces enzymes that synthesize LC-PUFAs.

Consumption of LA has increased in the industrialized world, whereas intake of ALA has decreased. Since LA and ALA compete as substrates for enzymatic transformation to LC-PUFAs, higher intake of LA reduces LC-ω3 formation.³,⁹,¹² Furthermore, only a fraction of ALA is converted to EPA, and even less to DHA.¹¹⁻¹⁷ Thus, an insufficient intake and/or transformation of ALA contribute to a poor LC-ω3 status in many adults. The consumption of LC-ω3-rich marine foods varies substantially within and between countries but is consistently associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Indeed, the American Heart³ and Diabetes¹⁸,¹⁹ Associations advocate the consumption of at least two meals of fatty fish a week – thereby providing ≈0.5 gm/day LC-ω3 – and even to consider supplementation of 1 gm/day EPA/DHA to patients with established CVD.³ Yet the average US intake of EPA and DHA is only ~100 mg/day.²⁰

In short, overt PUFA deficiency culminates in hepatic steatosis and the tissue content of LC-ω3s is likely sub-optimal in many adults. Considering their beneficial impact on cardiometabolic clusters (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis etc.), it is plausible that LC-ω3s could be of benefit in NAFLD, the hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome.

3. LC-ω3s in human insulin resistance: impact on lipid and glucose metabolism and relevance to NAFLD

Over-production of large, TG-rich VLDL is a hallmark feature of the IR state and a target in the prevention of CVD. According to a recent meta-analysis, 2–6 gms/day of supplemental fish oil dose-dependently reduces fasting TGs in adults with normo- to severe hypertriglyceridemia.²¹ In addition to over-the-counter supplements, highly-purified methyl and ethyl esters of LC-ω3 are available. One such product (Lovaza, ~900 mg methyl esters of EPA/ DHA in a 1 gm capsule) is an FDA-approved prescription medication indicated in severe hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson classification Type IV). Four capsules a day reduce TG by up to 45% in this condition.²²

Chan et al. demonstrated that the hypolipidemic effect of fish oil (4 gms/day EPA and DHA for 6 weeks) in obese men with normal liver enzymes could be attributed to a reduction in apolipoprotein B100 secretion and to increased conversion of VLDL to LDL. Supplementation did not improve the sensitivity to insulin, which normally promotes apo B100 degradation.²³,²⁴ The authors surmised that down-regulation of apo B100 was secondary to reduced TG availability, owing to inhibition of hepatic FA synthesis versus oxidation. This is supported by evidence that fish oil
supplementation attenuates fasting de novo lipogenesis and hypertriglyceridemia in healthy adults overfed fructose,²⁵ and shifts whole-body substrate utilization from glucose to FAs in adult diabetes.²⁶ However, a yet-to-be identified peroxide of LC-ω3 induces apo B100 degradation via post-ER, presecretory proteolysis in pre-clinical studies²⁷ potentially contributing to the reduced apo B100 and VLDL secretion in Chan’s studies.²⁸ Theoretically, LC-ω3-dependent apo B100 degradation could exacerbate retention of hepatocyte TG in NAFLD: patients are IR and often exhibit hypertriglyceridemia,²⁹ but fail to up-regulate Apo B100 in parallel to increased IHTG content, as do IR patients without steatosis.³⁰ One, therefore, cannot extrapolate LC-ω3's benefit from hypertriglyceridemia to NAFLD.

Different clinical and laboratory studies depict an increase, decrease or no change in insulin-dependent glucose metabolism (insulin sensitivity per clamp or HOMA-IR, HbA1c) following LC-ω3 administration to IR, obese and diabetic adults and rodents¹⁹,²⁵,²⁶,³¹–³³ (see also Supplemental references). From a mechanistic point of view as well, administration of LC-ω3s produces effects that are divergent vis-a-vis their impact on insulin sensitivity: On the one hand, LC-ω3s attenuate inflammation and TNF-α synthesis, inhibit IKK,¹² enhance PPAR-γ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ),¹⁹ reduce muscle³¹ and hepatic lipid content and increasing adiponectin concentration (see below); these actions generally attenuate IR. On the other hand, LC-ω3 consumption increases FA versus glucose utilization²⁶ and impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion;³² these would likely exacerbate hyperglycemia. It is plausible that the divergent effects of LC-ω3s on insulin signaling counter-balance one another such as to have minimal clinical impact on glucose concentrations. Indeed, meta-analyses and expert opinion conclude that on average, the net effect of LC-ω3 on glucose control appears to be neutral.¹⁹ Still, further research is indicated to identify instances and doses of LC-ω3 that may be hamper glucose control.

LC-ω3s also ameliorate post-prandial hypertriglyceridemia, in part by enhancing extra-hepatic clearance of chylomicron TGs.²¹ Furthermore, long-term supplementation with LC-ω3s reduces fasting Free FA (FFA) concentrations,³³ probably by attenuating lipolysis of adipose TGs. Thus, LC-ω3 may reduce supplies of adipose-derived FFAs and of chylomicron-remnant TGs, the leading sources of hepatic lipids in NAFLD.²⁹ However, evidence supporting this concept is less robust and consistent than that for a major hypotriglyceridemic effect.

To summarize, LC-ω3s consistently reduce VLDL/TG secretion in a dose-dependent manner in IR states. It is unclear to what extent this involves alterations in hepatic lipid supply, synthesis, oxidation and export, and therefore whether LC-ω3s would be therapeutic or detrimental to NAFLD patients. The net effect of LC-ω3 on glucose control and IR per se appears to be neutral.

### 4. LC-ω3 feeding in experimental NAFLD: efficacy, mechanisms and clinical relevance

#### 4.1. Nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis

Development of hepatic steatosis was attenuated when fish oil or purified EPA/DHA replaced other macronutrients as a source of energy in a number of experimental NAFLD models (Table 1), including provision of 1) a calorie-dense diet (*ad libitum* and long-term) to normal rodents,³⁴,³⁵ 2) a normal-to-high calorie diet to rodents that are genetically-predisposed to NAFLD, e.g., hyperphagic and/or insulin-resistant rodents,³⁶–⁴¹ and knockout of *ppar-α*⁴² or hepatic *Pten* (phosphatase and tensin homolog gene)⁴³ and 3) a diet depleted of methionine and choline (MCD).⁴⁴ Supplemental administration of fish oil or purified EPA/DHA also

protected rodents from NAFLD.⁴⁵,⁴⁶ Several of these studies demonstrated that the reduced accumulation of hepatic lipids could not be fully attributed to changes in caloric intake or weight gain.³⁶,³⁷,³⁹,⁴⁰,⁴³

A shift in fuel partitioning from FA synthesis to oxidation is a consistent mode of IHTG reduction by LC-ω3s. Activated PPAR-α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor), a transcription factor (TF) of the “adopted-orphan” nuclear receptor family, induces enzymes and other proteins involved in FA uptake, activation, transport into and oxidation within the mitochondria, microsomes and peroxisomes. Contrarily, the membrane-bound TFs, ChREBP and SREBP-1c (sterol/carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein) induce lipogenic enzymes⁶,⁴⁷ (Figs. 2 and 3a). Administration of LC-ω3s to NAFLD-prone rodents increased the nuclear abundance of hepatic PPAR-α while reducing that of ChREBP/SREBP-1c. Furthermore, the expression of PPAR-α-dependent, FA oxidative enzymes was increased, while that of ChREBP/SREBP1-c-dependent, lipogenic enzymes was reduced by LC-ω3 feeding.³⁵–⁴⁴,⁴⁶ LC-ω3 similarly influences the biology of the aforementioned TFs and FA-handling enzymes *in vitro* – through the action of intracellular LC-ω3 metabolites – as well as in healthy rodents.⁴⁸,⁴⁹ In rodents with NAFLD, LC-ω3 feeding also exerts a systemic, indirect effect on hepatocyte FA balance: LC-ω3 influences the production of agents (e.g., adiponectin, TNF-α) that signal to hepatocyte TF pathways (Table 1, Fig. 3b).

Oxidized LC-ω3 species, formed by oxygenases or interaction with the hydroxyl radical, display avid affinity for the PPAR ligand-binding domain and are likely important endogenous ligands.⁶,⁵⁰,⁵¹ That LC-ω3s augment hepatic PPAR-α in experimental NAFLD³⁴–³⁷,⁴¹,⁴³ and increase FA oxidation in diabetic patients²⁶ suggests that PPAR-α may be targeted by LC-ω3s in human NAFLD. However, there are recognized differences between human and murine PPAR-α,⁴⁹,⁵¹ and fish oil reduces hepatic lipid content even in *ppar-α⁻/⁻* mice.⁴²

EPA and DHA abrogate the transcriptional activity of SREBP-1c and ChREBP *in vitro*.⁴⁸,⁴⁹ Fish oil and purified EPA reduced the abundance of hepatic nuclear SREBP-1c, the consequent expression of lipogenic enzymes and the content of satFAs and MUFAs in experimental NAFLD,³⁶–³⁹,⁴⁶ including in hepatocyte-specific *Pten*-deficient mice.⁴³ These knock-outs exhibit exquisite insulin sensitivity, up-regulate SREBP-1c and develop steatosis. Up-regulation of SREBP-1c and de novo lipogenesis seems counter-intuitive in primary NAFLD – an IR state, but may be attributed to compensatory hyperinsulinemia, to SREBP-1c/lipogenesis’ retained sensitivity to insulin, and to insulin-dependent factors.⁶,²⁹ Inhibition of SREBP-1c by LC-ω3 is therefore pertinent to human NAFLD.

Whereas LC-ω3s consistently modulate the transcriptional activity of PPAR-α and SREBP-1c in experimental NAFLD, the data is conflicting as to which point(s) along the SREBP-1c expression → degradation pathway is inhibited by LC-ω3s, and as to whether PPAR-α expression, in addition to its activity, is enhanced by LC-ω3s. A comprehensive review is beyond the scope of this article; some details and further references appear in Fig. 3 and supplemental references, respectively.

Amelioration of NAFL by fish oil feeding was associated with elevated concentrations of adiponectin in the circulation and visceral adipose tissue.³⁴,³⁷,⁴¹ As opposed to other adipokines, adiponectin counters IR and its production decelerates as adipose tissue expands. Adiponectin ameliorates experimental NAFLD, in part by inhibiting hepatic SREBP-1c expression and lipogenesis.⁶,⁵²

j Of note, LC-ω3s and their oxy-metabolites also modulate the activity of other nuclear factors involved in various aspects of lipid metabolism (e.g., hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, FXR, PPAR-δ).³⁷,⁴⁸

This indirect effect of LC-ω3 on the liver's handling of lipids is of clinical pertinence: adiponectin concentration is low in NAFLD patients<sup>6</sup> whereas fish oil supplementation to the obese increases adiponectin in most,<sup>53–55</sup> but not all studies.<sup>56</sup>

Short term feeding of EPA decreases hepatic, but not CNS concentration of anandamide (arachidonyl ethanolamine), by displacing AA from anandamide's membranal precursor.<sup>57</sup> CNS and hepatic anandamide, an endogenous ligand of CB1R (cannabinoid 1 receptor), are elevated in obesity and are implicated in both overeating and excess hepatic lipogenesis (through SREBP-1c activation). CB1R antagonists promote weight-loss and ameliorate experimental NAFLD,<sup>6</sup> but their suppression of the brain's reward system manifests as troublesome mental side effects in human. Contrarily, LC-ω3 may alleviate depression and non-specific psychological symptoms,<sup>58</sup> as can be seen in NAFLD patients (Section 6). Involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the mental or hypolipidemic action of LC-ω3s is presently hypothetical.

Yamazaki et al. induced NAFL in ddY mice by feeding them a diet very rich in starch and sucrose, in safflower oil (MUFA, LA), or in butter (satFA). Replacing 4% of the energy obtained from fats with fish oil ameliorated hepatic steatosis in the carbohydrate group but not in the butter group. NAFL was actually exacerbated by fish oil in the safflower group and accompanied by an increase in IR and in SREBP-1c and PPAR-γ expression<sup>38</sup> (Table 1). PPAR-γ, which induces proteins involved in FA uptake and storage, is highly expressed in adipocytes. Its hepatic expression may be increased in NAFLD, possibly contributing to steatosis. LC-ω3s increase PPAR-γ activity and may thereby detrimentally induce an adipogenic transformation of the hepatocyte. It is unlikely that this would occur in humans, however: The daily intake of safflower oil in this study is equivalent to 140 g in an adult on a 2000 Kcal/day. Furthermore, in another study, a diet in which 60% of the calories came from various FAs, fish oil induced PPAR-γ yet reduced hepatic intrahepatic TGs compared with other FAs.<sup>35</sup> Still, the study by Yamazaki et al. points out the theoretical risk of LC-ω3s being in-effective or even detrimental in NAFLD.

### 4.2. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis

Fish oil is therapeutic in diseases with a prominent inflammatory component, in virtue of LC-ω3s' pleiotropic anti-inflammatory properties.<sup>12</sup> For instance, increased EPA intake reduces AA incorporation into membranes, resulting in synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes that are generally less pro-inflammatory than their AA-derived counterparts, e.g., PGE<sub>3</sub> vs PGE<sub>2</sub> and LTB<sub>5</sub> vs LTB<sub>4</sub>.<sup>12,61</sup> In addition, LC-ω3s down-regulate NF-κB-dependent expression of pro-inflammatory enzymes, cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules (e.g., COX-2, iNOS, TNF-α, IL-8 and ICAM-1) by antagonism of the Toll-like Receptor 4, attenuating signaling to IKK (the activator of NF-κB) and trans-repression of NF-κB-regulated genes. The latter effect is mediated through activation of PPAR-α/γ, which are also expressed in inflammatory cells. Furthermore, resolvins and protectins of the D-series are produced from DHA sometime after the classic inflammatory eicosanoids, at which time they orchestrate the resolution of inflammation. Finally, NF-κB is inhibited by certain forms of adiponectin, expression of which is increased by fish oil consumption.<sup>62</sup> Not surprisingly, the protection against inflammatory injury conferred by LC-ω3 feeding includes the liver.<sup>40,63</sup> Why then did fish oil fail to inhibit NF-κB activation, COX-2 expression, lobular inflammation and lipid peroxidation, despite attenuation of steatosis, in the MCD diet model of NASH?<sup>44</sup> True, unsaturation predisposes PUFAs to non-enzymatic peroxidation (it is therefore mandatory to increase co-consumption of vitamin E, a lipophilic free radical scavenger, in parallel to PUFA intake).<sup>9</sup> Spontaneously formed oxy-EPA species, the A3/J3-isoprostanes are detected by

Fig. 3. Dysregulation of fatty acid synthesis versus oxidation in NAFLD and its amelioration by LC-ω3s. 3A: In NAFLD, hyperinsulinemia drives the transcription of the SREBP-1c precursor (pSREBP-1c) by increasing the level of oxysterols. The latter activate LXR-α, which activates transcription when bound to RXR. pSREBP-1c is inactive and localized to the ER membrane. Insulin, TNF-α and ER stress induce cleavage of pSREBP-1c to mature SREBP-1c (mSREBP-1c), which translocates to its various nuclear response elements (RE). Elevated insulin and anandamide prevent the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of nuclear SREBP-1c (nSREBP-1c), culminating in the over-expression of lipogenic enzymes. Excess saturated FAs promote this process by inducing ER stress and the SREBP-1c co-activator, PGC-1β. A normal-to-low induction of FA oxidative enzymes fails to compensate for the excessive lipogenesis, culminating in hepatocyte steatosis. 3B: LC-ω3 feeding increases adiponectin production, while reducing that of TNF-α and anandamide, thereby inhibiting hepatocyte nSREBP-1c activity. Intracellular LC-ω3s undergo enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxygenation. Oxy-LC-ω3 mediators inhibit the LXR-RXR interaction, the stability of the pSREBP-1c transcript, and activate PPAR-α. The result is an increase in FA oxidative enzymes and a concomitant reduction in lipogenic enzymes.

hepatic nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2), a redox-sensitive TF that induces a battery of cytoprotective Phase II enzymes, including those involved in the synthesis of glutathione (GCL) and neutralization of reactive species (GST).<sup>64,65</sup> nrf2 appears to protect against hepatic steatosis and lipoperoxidation in rodents on a high-fat diet.<sup>66</sup> Contrarily, increased lipoperoxidation cannot be sufficiently countered by an up-regulation of glutathione (methionine-derived cysteine being a glutathione precursor) in the MCD model, resulting in redox-sensitive activation of NF-κB. We hypothesize that nutrients serving as glutathione precursors and free radical scavengers are pre-requisites for LC-ω3's anti-inflammatory effect. Indeed, EPA increased hepatic GST and GCLC expression and reduced liver injury and inflammation, as well as the serum-free radical concentration in the *Pten*<sup>−/−</sup> model.<sup>43</sup> Importantly, long-term EPA intake protected against two especially detrimental consequences of NAFLD mediated in part by lipid peroxidation: fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.<sup>43</sup> Still, there remains a potential risk that under certain conditions fish oil could exacerbate human steatohepatitis.

In a model that recapitulates progressive human NAFLD, Svegliati-Baroni et al.<sup>34</sup> provided Sprague-Dawley rats *ad libitum* chow rich in saturated fats for six months. The rodents exhibited incremental increases and progression of obesity-related NAFLD: macrovesicular steatosis, impaired liver insulin signaling and elevated ALT, followed by necro-inflammation and fibrosis. Mixing fish oil into the chow (EPA + DHA 500 mg/kg diet) during the second and third months reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation, and hepatocyte injury, necrosis, and apoptosis. In addition, hepatic TNF-α expression was lowered, whereas circulating and visceral adipose tissue adiponectin concentrations were elevated by fish oil. Unfortunately, fish oil supplementation was not prolonged for an additional 3 months by which time its effect on fibrosis could have been assessed. Still, the pleiotropic protective effects of fish oil in this study are clinically pertinent: the model used best approximates the human disease, and elevated TNF and low adiponectin concentrations are implicated in the metabolic derangements, but also hepatic necro-inflammation and hepatocyte apoptosis in human NASH.

It is biologically plausible that LC-ω3s could ameliorate established NAFLD and prevent the progression to fibrosis. However, the experimental evidence supporting such an effect<sup>43,45</sup> (see also Supplemental references) is less robust, consistent and direct than that for primary prevention of hepatic steatosis and inflammation.

### 5. PUFA intake and metabolism in observational studies of NAFLD

Prospective administration of nutrition questionnaires to cohorts and differential analysis of the FA composition (of erythrocyte membranes, circulating phospholipids, adipose tissue, etc.) support the “LC-ω3 insufficiency” hypothesis of CVD and the Metabolic Syndrome.<sup>3</sup> The correlation between the consumption of ALA and LC-ω3s, or the extent of transformation of the former to the latter, and between the subsequent incidence of NAFLD/NASH has not been assessed. Those cross-sectional and case-control studies that compared FA consumption and metabolism in NAFLD versus non-NAFLD adults were often small, did not differentiate between NAFLD and NASH, were highly heterogeneous regarding design, setting, choice of controls etc., or were not specific when referring to PUFAs (i.e., ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs, or 18-Carbon and LC-PUFAs were clumped together). With these limitations in mind, most studies do depict NAFLD patients as having a reduced intake of dietary ω-3 PUFAs and/or a lower relative concentration of LC-ω3s in tissues and blood ([Table 2](#table2)).

Araya et al.<sup>67</sup> compared the relative FA composition of liver and adipose tissue biopsies from morbidly obese NAFLD patients undergoing bariatric surgery with those obtained from overweight (but not obese) controls. ALA was reduced in adipose tissue, suggesting a lower dietary intake. Hepatic tissue from NAFL and NASH patients displayed depletion of PUFAs from TGs and PLs, which was more severe for LC versus 18C PUFAs and for LC-ω3s versus LC ω-6s. In a similar study, the authors<sup>68</sup> found that the altered hepatic PUFA profile at the time of surgery was mirrored in Red Blood Cell (RBC) membranes. After 3 months and an ≈20% decrease in body weight, RBC FA indices were markedly improved and approached the values seen in the control group. Since it is unlikely that intake of LC-ω3s/ALA increased following surgery, these studies suggest that both intake of ALA and its conversion to LC-ω3s are low in NAFLD. Zelber-sagi et al.<sup>69</sup> screened participants in a cross-sectional, national health and nutrition survey for NAFLD, resorting to interviews, liver enzyme measurements and abdominal ultrasonography. NAFLD patients reported a lower consumption of LC-ω3-rich fish in the past year. When accounting for BMI, the difference in fish intake approached significance.

Cortez-Pinto et al.<sup>70</sup> used a food frequency questionnaire to assess the macronutrient intake of 45 NASH patients over the previous year. After adjustment for BMI, it appeared that NASH patients consumed more ω-6 PUFAs — in absolute values and relative to ω-3 PUFAs — compared to 856 free living adults that served as controls. These data would have been more informative if the relative amounts of LC versus C18 PUFAs were detailed.

Allard et al.<sup>71</sup> performed a dietary assessment, liver biopsy and biochemical analysis of hepatic and RBC membrane FA composition in adults with suspected NAFLD. Based on the histological findings, the subjects were characterized as having NASH, simple steatosis (NAFL) or “minimal findings” (MF). NASH patients were more obese and the consumption of total and individual PUFAs was slightly lower than recommended in the whole cohort, with no inter-group difference in intake or RBC ALA, LA, EPA or DHA. Composition analysis of hepatic FA revealed lower concentrations of AA and DHA and a higher ALA to EPA + DHA ratio, but similar LA to AA and total ω3 to total ω6s ratios in NASH compared with that of the other subjects. One may hypothesize that the lower LC-PUFA in NASH, which was most profound for DHA, reflects an insufficient PUFA intake compounded by Δ<sup>-6</sup> desaturase dysfunction (DHA formation necessitates two-step Δ<sup>-6</sup> desaturation, see [Fig. 2](#fig2)). It is not evident, however, why RBC FA composition was similar in all the subjects.

Puri et al.<sup>72</sup> performed an extensive lipidomic evaluation of liver biopsies from NASH, NAFL and healthy adults. DHA, EPA and AA were depleted, the DHA + EPA to ALA ratio, the AA to LA ratio and the total ω-3 to total ω-6 ratio were lower in hepatic TG fractions of NAFL and NASH patients versus that in the controls; A trend of qualitatively similar changes was apparent in DiacylGlycerols (DGs), the second largest lipid fraction, although these did not reach significance. Thus LC-PUFAs were reduced, to a greater extent for the LC-ω3s. ALA, LA and Mead acid (the latter typically being elevated in ALA/LA deficiency) concentrations were similar in patients and controls, implicating an impaired transformation of 18C PUFAs, rather than their dietary deficiency. However, dietary intake was not evaluated, and AA- but not LC-ω3s — were depleted in the PCs and Free FAs of NASH patients. An increased utilization of AA in the production of lipid mediators and divergent incorporation of ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs into either PLs or TGs/DGs are also plausible explanations for their altered distribution. In either case, a coherent pattern of PUFA intake and metabolism in NAFLD/NASH does not emerge from the aforementioned studies, and in the most part, causality cannot be inferred. Epidemiologic cohort and mechanistic tracer studies are clearly indicated.

6. Published and ongoing clinical studies on LC-ω3 in NAFLD

Several prospective studies^74–78^ (Table 3), including two randomized, controlled trials (RCTs, Table 4) have shown that LC-ω3 reduce hepatic steatosis and ALT concentrations in NAFLD. Capanni et al.^74^ treated NAFLD patients with EPA for one year. Compared with patients who refused EPA supplementation, hepatic steatosis and serum ALT, AST and γ-GT were reduced in the treatment group. Interestingly, liver perfusion was also improved by EPA, perhaps reflecting an enhancement of hepatic microcirculatory function.^40^ The small RCT (*n* = 40) carried out by Spadaro et al.^75^ was the first to demonstrate the additive effect of LC-ω3 supplementation on steatosis and “transaminitis” in NAFLD patients receiving therapeutic lifestyle change instructions. Serum TG and TNF-α concentrations were reduced, whereas insulin sensitivity and HDL were increased in the intervention group. Zhu et al.^76^ performed the largest blinded RCT on LC-ω3s in NAFLD to date. A quantity of 6 g/day seal oil (rich in EPA, DPA and DHA) or placebo was randomly allocated to 144 patients with NAFLD and hyperlipidemia for 6 months. The two groups were matched for age, gender, BMI and disease duration. A reduction in hepatic steatosis (per ultrasonography), plasma ALT and TGs was seen in significantly more patients receiving LC-ω3s. An additional benefit of seal oil was an improvement in common NAFLD symptoms—right upper quadrant discomfort, nausea, fatigue etc., Interestingly, symptom alleviation was the first outcome parameter to improve significantly, as early as at 8 weeks, and was not due to a placebo effect.

The impact of LC-ω3s on NASH histopathology has only been assessed in a sub-set of patients. In the open-label trial by Tanaka et al.^77^ the degree of hepatic steatosis was reduced in 23 NASH patients who received 2.7 gm ethyl-EPA/day for one year.

Histopathologic features, including fibrosis, improved in six of the seven patients that agreed to a post-treatment biopsy. Three of the seven patients displayed a histologic response to EPA, when defined as a reduction of ≥3 in the NAFLD Activity Score. Intriguing reductions were seen in indices of inflammation, iron stores, oxidative stress and in Free FA concentrations.

Two clinical trials assessed the impact of fish oil on hepatic triglycerides in subjects with conditions that predispose to hepatic steatosis, obesity^79^ and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)^80^. Of note, treatment was of short duration (8 weeks) and the diagnosis of NAFLD was common, but was not an inclusion criterion in either study. 22 obese participants in Dallas Heart Study cohort who underwent non-invasive measurement of liver fat content were administered a placebo oil capsule for 4 weeks, followed by 9 g/d fish oil (~6 g/d LC-3) for 8 weeks^79^. Plasma triglycerides, VLDL and apo B 100 were reduced in the 16 subjects that completed the study, yet changes in liver fat content were variable and on-average not significant. Contrarily, a crossover RCT in 25 PCOS patients demonstrated that 4gm/day of fish oil for 8 weeks reduced hepatic fat, as assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (80). Although NAFLD was not an inclusion criterion, the 12 patients with hepatic steatosis (defined as percentage liver fat >5%) responded best to therapy. Whether treatment of a longer duration could reduce hepatic triglyceride fat contents that are initially within the normal range remains to be established.

Replacing saturated with cis-unsaturated fat in concert with higher intake of fiber, micronutrients and phytochemicals displaying insulin-sensitizing, hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory properties is associated with reduced cardiometabolic disease.^81^ Several of these dietary constituents ameliorate experimental and possibly human NAFLD^59–61^ (Supplemental references). Whereas supplementation of LC-ω3s is an attractive strategy for targeting

NAFLD, these FAs will likely be of greatest benefit when consumed from marine foods in the context of a plant-based diet, such as the Mediterranean diet. Indeed, partaking of a modified Mediterranean diet reduced ALT levels in obese type II diabetics to a greater extent than did the American Diabetic Association and low-glycemic index diets. 82

The results of several RCTs assessing LC-ω3s' efficacy and safety in the treatment of NAFLD should be available within the next 3 years (Table 5). Of especial importance are 2 large RCTs assessing post-treatment histopathology and studies on pediatric NAFLD. In our opinion, it is also necessary to perform RCTs assessing LC-ω3s' efficacy 1) at different dosages, possibly adjusted to weight, 2) in reducing markers of sub-clinical CVD (blood pressure, CRP, endothelial function, carotid intima-media thickness, etc.) and 3) in improving wellbeing and quality of life of NAFLD patients. The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of LC-ω3s' supplementation in primary prevention of NAFLD- in adults with the metabolic syndrome or DM II but healthy livers, for instance- should also be addressed. Finally, epidemiologic and intervention studies evaluating the effect of adherence to Mediterranean-like diets on the incidence and progression of NAFLD are indicated.

How should the present knowledge influence decision-making for health-care professionals that manage NAFLD patients? In our opinion, 1) advocating omega-3 supplementation in NAFLD/NASH should await the results of the aforementioned, ongoing studies assessing histopathology before and after treatment. In the interim, 2) the consumption of two oily-fish meals a week is appropriate in NAFLD/NASH patients — although the efficacy and safety of this strategy have not been confirmed in RCTs— especially when fish replaces meat as a source of energy and is consumed along with plant-based foods. Guidelines on nutrient consumption (including omega-3 PUFAs) in NAFLD should ideally be formulated by experts in the field.
