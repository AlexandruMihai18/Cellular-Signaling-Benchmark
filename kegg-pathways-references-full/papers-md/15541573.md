and not adult rat ovarian granulosa cells (Fridmacher et al., 1992; Pan et al., 1992; Frojdman et al., 1993), suggesting that ras oncogenic transformation induces a combination of characteristics that resemble a fetal, rather than adult, ROG phenotype.

The DC3 cell line was similarly derived from SV40-transformed granul
gestrone increase as primary granulosa cells. The stimulated cAMP levels increased 20-fold within 30 minutes and returned to basal levels after 3 hours. Progesterone production was detected after 12 hours of FSH stimulation. CYP11A expression was also increased in response to FSH stimulation. In contrast, primary rat granulosa cells responded to LH and hCG, whereas

This spontaneously immortalized cell line was developed from 45-day-old Berlin Duckery rats (Stein et al.,
Granulosa cells were obtained from large, antral, preovulatory follicles (>2mm) from the marmoset monkey, *Callithrix jacchus*, and transfected with a plasmid containing the SV40 genome. The cell line had undergone up to 40 passages before characterization. Unlike SV40 transformed ovarian granulosa cell lines in other animal models, SV4

6.2.4.1. Origins. In an effort to develop a gonadotropin responsive granulosa cell line, the investigators responsible for the HO-23 cell line developed the HGP53 cell line (Table 3). Essentially, this was done by cotransfection of primary granulosa cells with the Ha-ras
