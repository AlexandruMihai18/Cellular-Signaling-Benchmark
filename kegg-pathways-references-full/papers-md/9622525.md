Late exponential phase hairy root cultures of *Catharanthus roseus* were elicited with pectinase and jasmonic acid. The effects of elicitor concentration and exposure time on growth and levels of several compounds in the indole alkaloid biosynthetic pathway were monitored. Pectinase decreased the fresh weight to dry weight ratio of the roots, while addition of jasmonic acid had no significant effect. Selective effects on indole alkaloid yields were observed upon addition of elicitors. An increase of 150% in tabersonine specific yield was observed upon addition of 72 units of pectinase. Transient studies at the same level demonstrated possible catabolism as serpentine, tabersonine, and lochnericine levels decreased immediately after elicitation. The levels of these compounds recovered back to control levels or were higher than the control levels after some time. Jasmonic acid was found to be a unique elicitor leading to an enhancement in flux to several branches in the indole alkaloid pathway. Jasmonic acid addition caused an increase in the specific yields of ajmalicine (80%), serpentine (60%), lochnericine (150%), and hörhammericine (500%) in dosage studies. Tabersonine, the likely precursor of lochnericine and hörhammericine, decreased at lower levels of jasmonic acid and then increased with increasing jasmonic acid concentration. Transient studies showed that lochnericine and tabersonine levels go through a maxima, then decrease back to control levels and reduce below control levels, respectively. The yields of ajmalicine, serpentine, and hörhammericine increased continuously after the addition of jasmonic acid. The methods described in this article could generally be used in devising strategies for enhancement in productivity of secondary metabolites and for probing and studying the complex secondary metabolite pathways in plant tissue cultures.

### Introduction

*Catharanthus roseus* is an important source of the anticancer alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine and the antihypertensive compounds ajmalicine and serpentine (Moreno et al., 1995). Currently these drugs are produced by extraction of the whole plant (DiCosmo and Misawa, 1995). Plant cell and tissue cultures have been investigated as an alternate source of production; however, low yields of these compounds and the absence of vindoline (a precursor of vinblastine and vincristine) are the key bottlenecks to this technology (Moreno et al., 1995). Hairy root cultures of *C. roseus*, with their apparent genetic stability, high levels of differentiation, and amenability to genetic transformations, have been investigated in the past decade for production of indole alkaloids (Parr et al., 1988; Toivonen et al., 1989; Bhadra et al., 1991; Jung et al., 1992; Vazquez-Flota et al., 1994). The complexity of the indole alkaloid biosynthetic pathways has presented a major challenge for enhancement of secondary metabolite productivity and a combination of approaches will be essential for enhanced production.

The secondary metabolite pathways of *C. roseus* have been reviewed in detail by Meijer et al. (1993). A simplified portion of the pathway leading to biosynthesis of indole alkaloids is shown in Figure 1. Ajmalicine, serpentine, catharanthine, and tabersonine are readily synthesized in hairy root cultures of *C. roseus*; however, vindoline is absent (van der Heijden et al., 1989; Moreno et al., 1995; Vani, 1996). Lochnericine and hörhammericine, recently quantified in our root cultures, are believed to be derivatives of tabersonine, a key precursor of vindoline (Vani, 1996). The magnitude of concentration of these compounds indicates that conversion of tabersonine into lochnericine and hörhammericine possibly diverts flux away from the tabersonine to vindoline branch (Vani, 1996). Despite an initial report of low levels of vinblastine in hairy roots (Parr et al., 1988), vinblastine and its key precursor vindoline have not been able to be produced in subsequent studies. Also ajmalicine and serpentine are produced in too low of quantities for commercialization. Advances in cloning of genes in the indole alkaloid pathway indicate that metabolic engineering may eventually be used to eliminate some of the bottlenecks in the pathways (Kutchan, 1995); however, metabolic studies with standard tools such as fungal elicitation to manipulate flux will be necessary and complementary to genetic approaches in the advancement of production goals.

Figure 1. Part of the pathway showing some of the quantified indole alkaloids of *Catharanthus roseus* (for the complete pathway, see Meijer et al. (1993)). 4,21-Dehydrogeissoschizine is the precursor that enters the cathenamine pathway and is converted to antihypertensive alkaloids ajmalicine and serpentine. Stemmadenine is postulated to be synthesized from 4,21-dehydrogeissoschizine through an unknown step. Tabersonine and catharanthine emerge from stemmadenine via some unknown reactions. Tabersonine further goes through six reactions to produce vindoline. Tabersonine is also the putative precursor of lochnericine and hörhammericine (Vani, 1996) (dotted arrows represent unknown steps, solid arrows represent known steps, and multiple arrows represent several steps).

Fungal elicitation has been an effective technique for enhancement of levels of secondary metabolites (Eilert et al., 1986) and as a tool to study metabolism (Srinivasan et al., 1996). Most of the strategies employing fungal elicitation utilize fairly undefined mixtures such as autoclaved fungal homogenates (Yoshikawa et al., 1993b) or the fungal culture filtrates (Pasquali et al., 1992; Ciddi et al., 1995). Effects of fungal homogenates and other elicitors on *C. roseus* cultures have been studied, but only the accumulation of ajmalicine and catharanthine has been monitored (Asada and Shuler, 1989; Sim et al., 1994; Vazquez-Flota et al., 1994). The use of specific elicitor components to determine their effects on several indole alkaloids in the pathway may lead to more precise strategies to enhance synthesis of desired alkaloids. In addition to elicitor specificity, elicitor dosage and timing of harvest after elicitation are important factors in studying the enhancement of alkaloid levels. High dosages of elicitors has been known to induce hypersensitive response (Collinge and Susarenko, 1987; Mukundan and Hjorsoto, 1990; Roewer et al., 1992), leading to cell death while a minimal level is required for induction of a response. Transient changes in concentrations of several secondary metabolites have been observed in response to elicitation, due to transient induction of genes (Seitz et al., 1989; Pasquali et al., 1992; Roewer et al., 1992). Thus, determination of the secondary metabolite profiles in response to elicitation is also essential for maximization of yield by optimization of the harvest time.

In this study, two different types of elicitors, each with a different role in the plant defense response to pathogens, were tested to stimulate indole alkaloid production. *Aspergillus niger* pectinase is an endopolygalacturonase which attacks plant cell walls (Alghisi and Favaron, 1995), and jasmonic acid is a signal transducer (Gundlach et al., 1992; Müller et al., 1993; Farmer, 1994). Indole alkaloids in the cathenamine branch (ajmalicine and serpentine) and those around the tabersonine branch point (tabersonine, lochnericine, and hörhammericine) were quantified in response to elicitation. In this paper, we report the effects of both elicitor dosage and elicitor exposure time on indole alkaloid accumulation by *C. roseus* hairy root cultures.

### Materials and Methods

#### Hairy Root Cultures
The experiments were conducted with the *C. roseus* hairy root clone LBE 6-1 (Bhadra et al., 1993). Approximately 0.05 g fresh weight (five root tips, 35–40 mm long (Bhadra and Shanks, 1995)) of roots, derived from a 3-week subculture cycle (Rijhwani and Shanks, 1998), were inoculated into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 mL of Gamborgs B5/2 media with 30 g/L sucrose. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.7 prior to filter sterilization. The cultures were grown on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm, at 26 °C in the dark, for 3 weeks. Evaporation controls were also done simultaneously, and autoclaved water was added every week to account for the water lost due to evaporation. After 3 weeks, late exponential phase root cultures were used to study the effect of elicitor dosage and elicitor exposure times.

#### Dosage Studies
Pectinase and jasmonic acid were added separately to late exponential phase root cultures. No elicitor was added to the control cultures. *A. niger* pectinase (solution in 40% glycerol, Sigma) was sterilized using a 0.22-μm filter and was added at five different levels of 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 units per flask. Jasmonic acid solution was prepared by mixing 250 mg of jasmonic acid in 10 mL of Milli-Q water. The jasmonic acid solution was filter sterilized using a 0.22-μm filter and was added to late exponential stage cultures at three different levels of 10, 50, and 100 μL/flask corresponding to 0.25, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/flask, respectively. The solution was vortexed thoroughly before addition to shake flasks. Triplicate flasks were run for each dosage and control. Independent controls were performed with each dosage experiment to compare treatments with controls at the same stage in the growth cycle. All cultures were harvested 48 h after the addition of elicitor and were then analyzed for biomass and indole alkaloid content.

#### Transient Studies
For the transient studies, jasmonic acid solution was prepared as in dosage studies. The pectinase solution was a new formulation (pectinase solution in KCl and sorbitol) purchased from Sigma. Pectinase (72 units) and jasmonic acid (0.25 mg) were added to late exponential phase cultures (21 days after inoculation). The transient was conducted for approximately 4–5 days after the addition of elicitor. In all transient studies, shake flasks were harvested in triplicate at each time point and several time points were analyzed for biomass and alkaloid content.

Two different types of control experiments were conducted. Previously, indole alkaloid profiles for *C. roseus* hairy root cultures were reported (Bhadra and Shanks, 1997) and some of the alkaloids (tabersonine and ajmalicine) were observed to go through a maximum in yields. For each transient experiment, controls were performed from the same source culture as the elicited culture but were harvested only at the beginning, middle, and end of each experiment to obtain transient control profiles. In a separate experiment, possible fluctuations in the alkaloid profiles of the control cultures were tested by harvesting shake flasks (in triplicates) at different times during the 5-day period (21–26 days after inoculation). This strategy was employed to reduce tedious redundant analysis and yet obtain a control profile in each experiment for the purpose of comparison.

#### Biomass Measurements
Hairy roots were dried by blotting all the external moisture and were weighed to

determine the final fresh weight (FW). These roots were then transferred to preweighed lyophilizer bottles and frozen to –40 °C. The frozen roots were dried by lyophilization until no weight loss occurred. The final weight of the roots and bottle was measured, and the dry weight (DW) of the roots was calculated.

**Extraction, Fractionation, and HPLC Analysis.**  
Hairy roots were extracted and fractionated as in Bhadra et al. (1993). Alkaloids were extracted from 180 to 210 mg of freeze-dried root cultures with 85–90 mL of methanol for 3 h in a Soxhlet extractor. The extract was concentrated to 1.6 mL in a rotary evaporator and was diluted by adding 2.4 mL of 5 mM \((\mathrm{NH}_4)_2\mathrm{PO}_4\) solution. Fractionation was performed using a C-18 Maxi-Clean cartridge (Alltech, Deerfield, IL). The cartridge was conditioned by pretreating with 10 mL of methanol, 10 mL of Milli-Q water, and 4 mL of a 40:60 methanol:5 mM \((\mathrm{NH}_4)_2\mathrm{PO}_4\) mixture. The sample was loaded onto the cartridge and the eluent collected at a constant rate using a syringe pump. The cartridge was subsequently washed with 60:40 methanol:5 mM \((\mathrm{NH}_4)_2\mathrm{PO}_4\) solution followed by 95:5 methanol:5 mM \((\mathrm{NH}_4)_2\mathrm{PO}_4\) solution. Culture medium was loaded on a C-18 Maxi-Clean cartridge (Alltech, Deerfield, IL), preconditioned by treating with 10 mL of methanol and 10 mL of Milli-Q water. The cartridge was subsequently washed with 4 mL of methanol. HPLC analysis was performed for all eluents to determine the alkaloid content.

The HPLC system consisted of two Waters 510 pumps, a Waters Wisp 712 injector, a Phenomenex C18 bondclone reverse phase column (300 mm length, 3.9 mm diameter), a Phenomenex C18 bondclone reverse phase guard column (100 mm length, 3.9 mm diameter), and a Waters 996 PDA detector. Millennium 2010 software (Waters) was used for acquisition and analysis on a NEC Image 466es workstation. Isocratic conditions using 41:59 methanol:5 mM \((\mathrm{NH}_4)_2\mathrm{PO}_4\) solution at a flow rate of 1 mL/min were used to separate the alkaloids. Calibrations were done on authentic standards, and quantification was performed on chromatograms extracted at 254 and 329 nm. Peak identification was based on a comparison of retention time and UV spectra with authentic standards of ajmalicine (Fluka), serpentine (Research Plus, Bayonne, NJ), catharanthine (gift of Dr. Hamada, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan), and tabersonine (gift of Dr. Hamada). Hörrhammericine and lochnericine were quantified upon the basis of the HPLC response factor of tabersonine, as in Vani (1996).

**Statistical Analysis.** Students t-test (Microsoft Excel 5.0) was used to compare the means.

**Results**

Late exponential phase hairy root cultures of *C. roseus* were elicited with two specific elicitors, and the effect on indole alkaloid accumulation was studied. Dosage studies were performed to determine the effects of elicitor concentration on growth and indole alkaloid production. Cultures were elicited with different concentrations of the elicitor, harvested 48 h after the addition of the elicitor, and then analyzed for indole alkaloids. One concentration of each elicitor from the dosage studies was chosen for transient experiments, and cultures were harvested and analyzed for intracellular indole alkaloid accumulation at different time points after elicitation. Excretion of indole alkaloids into the medium was not detected in our root cultures in response to elicitation. Consequently, all results reported are for intracellular concentrations of indole alkaloids.

(B) Fresh weight to dry weight ratio of the pectinase elicited and the control cultures in transient studies. Cultures were harvested in triplicate at each time point. Error bars indicate standard deviations.

**Transient Control Experiment.** Since previous work in our group showed that tabersonine is growth-associated and hence could experience a maximum in yield during exponential phase (Bhadra and Shanks, 1997), a separate transient control experiment was performed on a finer time scale for all of the alkaloids monitored. This experiment tested for fluctuations in the alkaloid profiles of the control cultures during the 5-day period between 21 and 26 days after inoculation. Figure 2 (Supporting Information) shows the time resolution of the profiles of ajmalicine and serpentine (supporting Figure 2A) and those of tabersonine, lochnericine, and hörrhammericine (supporting Figure 2B). The alkaloid profiles determined in this experiment show that no sudden changes in the indole alkaloid yields occur during the 5-day experimental period. Hence, for the transient elicitation studies, control cultures were harvested at three points only in each experiment to determine the control alkaloid profiles for comparison with those of elicited cultures.

**Effects of Pectinase.** The fresh weight to dry weight (FW/DW) ratio was monitored for the elicited and control cultures in both dosage and transient studies. In pectinase dosage studies, the FW/DW ratio of the elicited cultures was lower than that of controls, as shown in Figure 3A. As the amount of pectinase was increased from 0 to 120 units/flask, the FW/DW decreased from 15.25 to 14.5 (\(p \leq 0.05\)), indicating the dependence of FW/

DW ratio on the concentration of pectinase added. The FW of the root cultures remained constant in the range of 3.9 ± 0.3 g/flask for the entire range of pectinase dosage used (Figure 3A). In the transient study, a similar decline in the FW/DW ratio of both the control and the elicited root cultures was observed. A decline in the FW/DW ratio of unelicited late exponential phase *C. roseus* hairy root cultures was reported previously (Bhadra and Shanks, 1997). However, the FW/DW ratio of the elicited root cultures was lower than that of controls, as shown in Figure 3B. The FW/DW ratio of the elicited cultures decreased from 15 to 10.25 in 120 h, while in case of control cultures, the FW/DW ratio decreased from 15.5 to 12.5 in the same time. No significant difference in the fresh weights of the elicited and the control cultures was observed (data not shown). Hence, the difference in the FW/DW ratio is due to high DW of the elicited cultures as compared to that of controls. This increase in DW is likely caused by new material deposition on the cell walls as a barrier to the invading agent which is an important component of the defense response (Yoshikawa et al., 1993a; Robertson et al., 1995).

In dosage studies, pectinase addition resulted in a significant effect on tabersonine levels only. No significant effect of pectinase dosage was seen on the levels of ajmalicine and serpentine. The specific and total yields of ajmalicine remained constant around 0.75 mg/gDW and 4 mg/L, respectively (data not shown). This result is consistent with the observations of Garnier et al. (1996), who did not observe any effect of pectinase addition on ajmalicine synthesis by *C. roseus* cell suspension cultures. Serpentine levels were slightly lower than that of ajmalicine (data not shown). The specific yield of tabersonine increased significantly (*p* ≤ 0.05) in dosage experiments, as the amount of pectinase added was increased beyond 48 units (Figure 4). The maximum specific yield of tabersonine (2.5 times that of control) was observed when 72 units of pectinase was added (Figure 4). Beyond the maximum, the levels of tabersonine decreased to 1.9 times the control values at 120 units of pectinase. Despite the alteration in flux observed in tabersonine, no significant effect of pectinase dosage was seen on the two tabersonine-derived compounds, hörhammericine and lochnericine, as compared to controls. The specific and total yields of hörhammericine remained

constant at 1.1 mg/gDW and 6 mg/L, respectively, while lochnericine specific and total yields were 3.9 mg/gDW and 20 mg/L, respectively (data not shown).

Since dosage experiments only give one time point, transient experiments were performed. A pectinase concentration of 72 units per flask was used in transient study, since a 2.5 times increase in tabersonine specific yield was obtained at this level. As in the dosage study, no significant effect of pectinase exposure time on the specific yield of ajmalicine was observed (data not shown). However, an analysis of the indole alkaloid content of the elicited and the control cultures in transient studies showed that serpentine apparently was catabolized or transformed to other compounds immediately after elicitation. The specific yield of serpentine decreased from 0.6 mg/gDW, immediately after the addition of the elicitor, and reached a minimum value of 0.35 mg/gDW, 6 h after elicitation (Figure 5). The specific yield of serpentine then recovered back to 0.55 mg/gDW, 24 h after elicitation. At 120 h, there was no significant difference in serpentine specific yields between elicited and control cultures (Figure 5).

The initial decline observed with serpentine was also seen with tabersonine and lochnericine. Tabersonine specific yield decreased from 1.1 mg/gDW, reaching a minimum value of 0.5 mg/gDW at 10 h. The specific yield of tabersonine increased continuously after 10 h and reached control levels 50 h after the addition of the elicitor. At 120 h the specific yield of tabersonine in elicited cultures was 1.15 mg/gDW, as compared to the control level of 0.6 mg/gDW (Figure 6A). Lochnericine levels decreased rapidly from 3.25 to 1.5 mg/gDW 3 h after the addition of pectinase. After 3 h, the specific yields of lochnericine increased beyond the control levels, crossing the control levels approximately 48 h after elicitation (Figure 6B). Hörhammericine specific yields, on the other hand, appear to increase immediately after addition of pectinase, but this increase was not statistically significant (Figure 6C). Furthermore, the initial decrease in tabersonine and lochnericine does not result in an equivalent increase in hörhammericine levels. Thus catabolism or conversion to other unknown compounds could be responsible for this observation.

The preparation of pectinase did affect tabersonine levels. The tabersonine levels at 72 units of pectinase in the dosage studies (at 48 h) did not correspond to the tabersonine specific yields obtained 48 h after the addition

**Effects of Jasmonic Acid.** Jasmonic acid did not have a significant effect on the FW/DW ratio in either dosage or transient experiments (data not shown). Jasmonic acid stimulated changes in alkaloid levels for all five compounds monitored in dosage studies. The specific yield of ajmalicine increased significantly ($p \leq 0.05$) as the dosage of jasmonic acid was increased. Ajmalicine levels increased from 0.5 mg/gDW in controls to 0.9 mg/gDW upon addition of 2.5 mg/flask of jasmonic acid

Figure 7. Specific yields of (A) ajmalicine and serpentine and (B) tabersonine, lochnericine, and hörhammericine versus jasmonic acid concentration.

Error bars indicate standard deviation.

(Figure 7A). Specific yield of serpentine was not significantly altered when 0.25 or 1.25 mg of jasmonic acid was added to each flask; however, on addition of 2.5 mg of jasmonic acid per flask, serpentine specific yield increased significantly ($p \leq 0.05$) to 1.1 mg/gDW as compared to the control levels of 0.7 mg/gDW (Figure 7A). Specific yields of tabersonine decreased significantly ($p \leq 0.05$), from 1.08 mg/gDW in controls to 0.2 mg/gDW upon addition of 0.25 mg of jasmonic acid per flask. As the amount of jasmonic acid was increased to 1.25 and 2.5 mg per flask, tabersonine specific yields increased but were less than the control levels (Figure 7B). Specific yields of hörhammericine and lochnericine were strongly dependent upon jasmonic acid dosage. Lochnericine levels decreased from 3.2 mg/gDW (controls) to 2.6 mg/gDW upon addition of 0.25 mg of jasmonic acid per flask. However, upon addition of higher concentrations of jasmonic acid, the specific yield of lochnericine increased significantly and reached a concentration of 7.5 mg/gDW (2.3 times control levels). The specific yield of hörhammericine increased as the concentration of jasmonic acid was increased from 0.25 to 2.5 mg/flask. The specific yield of hörhammericine was 1.37 mg/gDW in controls, and it increased 5-fold to 6.5 mg/gDW upon addition of 2.5 mg of jasmonic acid per flask (Figure 7B).

Since we were interested in studying fluxes around the tabersonine branch point, the concentration of 0.25 mg of jasmonic acid per flask was chosen for transient experiments to probe the decrease in tabersonine levels. As observed at this jasmonic acid concentration in dosage

studies, no significant effect of jasmonic acid exposure time on ajmalicine specific yield was seen in transient experiments (data not shown). Specific yields of serpentine increased continuously upon addition of jasmonic acid. At time 0, the specific yield of serpentine was similar to controls at 0.5 mg/gDW and it increased to 0.87 mg/gDW 100 h after elicitation, while the control levels were about 0.5 mg/gDW at that time (Figure 8).

The specific yields of tabersonine and lochnericine increased rapidly upon the addition of jasmonic acid. Tabersonine specific yields increased from 0.55 to 1.2 mg/ gDW 14 h after the addition of the elicitor. After the maximum at 14 h, the levels of tabersonine decreased and were below the control levels by 48 h after the addition of the elicitor, corroborating the decrease in tabersonine levels observed in the dosage studies (Figure 9A). Lochnericine levels increased from 5 mg/gDW at time 0 to 7.2 mg/gDW 24 h after the addition of jasmonic acid. Subsequently the specific yield of lochnericine decreased continuously and was same as that for controls after 70 h of elicitation (Figure 9B). Hörrhammericine levels, on the other hand, increased continuously after the addition of the jasmonic acid. The specific yield of hörrhammericine increased from 1.15 mg/gDW at time 0 to 6.8 mg/gDW (a 6-fold increase) 100 h after the addition of jasmonic acid (Figure 9C).

### Discussion

Dosage and transient studies, with hairy root cultures of *C. roseus*, were conducted to demonstrate the importance of both elicitor concentration and exposure times on indole alkaloid production. Since the secondary metabolites produced by our hairy roots are intracellular, elicitor addition was performed in the late exponential stage of the cultures (i.e., when sufficient biomass had accumulated). Two different elicitors, a fungal polygalacturonase and a signal transducer, were used, and the growth and yield parameters were determined.

Fast accumulation of biomass and an increase in indole alkaloid specific yield are essential for enhancement in total yields. The fresh weights and the dry weights of the elicited and control root cultures were monitored to determine if any elicitor had detrimental effects on growth. Only pectinase had a significant effect on growth. The action of pectinase (an endopolygalacturonase) leads to breakdown of plant cell wall pectins into small oligogalacturonides and causes wall loosening (Cervone et al., 1989). The damage caused by the enzyme could lead to enhanced deposition of wall-bound phenolics on the cell wall to patch up the damage and also form a barrier to prevent further spread of the pathogen. As the concentration or exposure time of pectinase increases, more damage could be caused to the cells. To combat this damage, plant cells deposit more wall-bound phenolics to prevent further degradation of cell walls (Negeral and Javelle, 1995). This deposition perhaps leads to an enhancement in the dry weight. This explains the lower FW/DW ratio in elicited cultures, compared to that of controls, as observed in supporting Figure 2. Unlike pectinase, jasmonic acid did not have any effect on the FW/DW ratio of the root cultures.

Identification of the points of metabolic control is essential for desired manipulation of plant cell cultures (Srinivasan et al., 1996). Signal transducers such as

jasmonic acid are believed to play an important role in defense gene regulation and induction (Gundlach et al., 1992; Müller et al., 1993; Farmer, 1994). Low concentrations of jasmonic acid have been shown to be present constitutively in plant cells, while higher amounts are responsible for cell death or growth inhibition (Creelman and Mullet, 1995); hence, dosage of jasmonic acid is an important parameter. In our studies, an increase in the concentration of jasmonic acid caused an increase in the levels of all the alkaloids quantified with no effect on growth, indicating an overall enhancement in flux to the alkaloid pathway. A rigorous optimization of jasmonic acid dosage could perhaps further enhance the levels of indole alkaloids.

Implementation of precise strategies for enhancement in production of valuable secondary metabolites is also hampered by the rapid and, in some cases, complete turnover of secondary metabolites. The phytotoxic nature of these compounds has been proposed as the probable reason for active catabolism (Whitehead and Threlfall, 1992). In plants, the necrotic tissue at the site of infection provides a sink for these compounds. However, high accumulation of secondary metabolites is not observed in cultured cells, even though the activities of enzymes involved in their biosynthesis are enhanced upon fungal elicitation (Moreno et al., 1996). Involvement of chemical degradation and biotransformation in catabolism of indole alkaloids, synthesized by *C. roseus* cell suspension cultures, has been shown using isotope labeling studies (Schripsema et al., 1994). The transient decline in specific yields of tabersonine, lochnericine, and serpentine observed upon addition of pectinase indicates the possibility of short-term activation of catabolic processes in response to pectinase elicitation. Thus pectinase elicitation may be a method to study catabolic processes in the indole alkaloid pathway if transformation to other unknown compounds, or a temporary reduction in biosynthesis, can be quantified or ruled out.

Elicitor exposure time also plays a significant role in transient induction of genes, activation of enzymes, and accumulation of several products (Seitz et al., 1989; Pasquali et al., 1992; Roewer et al., 1992). Therefore, transient studies can be used to study the regulation of the secondary metabolite pathways. The contrasting transient profiles of tabersonine and lochnericine, obtained after the addition of jasmonic acid versus pectinase, suggest that jasmonic acid is not a part of the signal transduction cascade that leads to manifestation of the response produced by pectinase. The effect of jasmonic acid on the various points of the pathway is evident from the striking difference in the profiles of serpentine and hörhammericine (end point alkaloids) which, unlike tabersonine and lochnericine (intermediates), increase continuously after elicitation. Determination of transient metabolite profiles and hence the optimal exposure time for enhanced productivity can also have a significant impact on the elicitor requirement in bioreactor scale-up. Upon the basis of the transient profiles of a specific metabolite, binding curves at the optimal exposure times should be determined and utilized in the elicitor binding model (Singh et al., 1994) to predict dosage requirements for secondary metabolite production from root cultures. Evidence indicates that tabersonine is turned over into lochnericine and hörhammericine (Morgan and Shanks, manuscript in preparation). We have observed a transient reduction in the levels of lochnericine and hörhammericine upon elicitation with pectinase possibly due to conversion to unknown compounds. Jasmonic acid addition on the other hand seems to stimulate the enzymes

leading to biosynthesis of tabersonine and lochnericine rather than the ones leading to their degradation, hence leading to a transient increase in their specific yields. Jasmonic acid and its ester, methyl jasmonate, appear to have a positive effect on secondary metabolite production in over 36 plant species (Gundlach et al., 1992). Transient increase of jasmonates upon addition of elicitors and transient induction in enzyme activities upon addition of jasmonates have been reported in the literature (Gundlach et al., 1992; Müller et al., 1993). Therefore, these compounds may be effective universal elicitors for enhancement of defense-related secondary metabolite levels in a plant cell or tissue culture process. Multifold enhancements in secondary metabolite production in response to jasmonic acid treatments have been reported in *Catharanthus* and *Cinchona* seedlings (Aerts et al., 1994), in suspension-cultured rice cells (Nojiri et al., 1996), and in suspension cultures of *Taxus* species (Yukimune et al., 1996). We saw an enhancement in the levels of several alkaloids upon addition of jasmonic acid to our root cultures. Thus, jasmonic acid seems to be an excellent choice as an elicitor for enhancement in secondary metabolite yields.

### Conclusion

In summary, we have demonstrated the effect of two different elicitor components on synthesis of indole alkaloids by *C. roseus* hairy roots. Jasmonic acid appears to be an excellent elicitor leading to an overall enhancement of flux in several branches of the indole alkaloid pathway of *C. roseus*, without any deleterious effects on growth. Transient induction of genes or an increase in enzyme activities in response to elicitation likely leads to rapid enhancement in biosynthesis (as seen upon jasmonic acid addition) or catabolism (as seen upon pectinase addition) of secondary metabolites. Metabolic studies of the responses induced by the known fungal cell wall components, fungal enzymes, and signal transducers independently can give information on the specific effects of each component. Using these specific components in correct dosage, or their mixtures in different proportions, more precise manipulations could be used to probe the complex secondary metabolite pathways and their regulation and to induce a targeted branch of the secondary metabolite pathway for enhancement in production of desired compounds.
