## Purpose of review

Various studies have delineated the causal role of dietary cholesterol in atherogenesis. Strategies have thus been developed to minimize cholesterol absorption, and cholesterol transport proteins found at the apical membrane of enterocytes have been extensively investigated. This review focuses on recent progress related to various brush-border proteins that are potentially involved in alimentary cholesterol transport.

## Recent findings

Molecular mechanisms responsible for dietary cholesterol and plant sterol uptake have not been completely defined. Growing evidence, however, supports the concept that several proteins are involved in mediating intestinal cholesterol transport, including SR-BI, NPC1L1, CD36, aminopeptidase N, P-glycoprotein, and the caveolin-1/annexin-2 heterocomplex. Other ABC family members (ABCA1 and ABCG5/ABCG8) act as efflux pumps favoring cholesterol export out of absorptive cells into the lumen or basolateral compartment. Several of these cholesterol carriers influence intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and are controlled by transcription factors, including RXR, LXR, SREBP-2 and PPARα. The lack of responsiveness of NPC1L1-deficient mice to ezetimibe suggests that NPC1L1 is likely to be the principal target of this cholesterol-lowering drug.

## Summary

The understanding of the role, genetic regulation and coordinated function of proteins mediating intestinal cholesterol transport may lead to novel ways of treating cardiovascular disease.

## Introduction

The development of drugs able to reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption has expanded options for preventing and treating cardiovascular disease. Drugs such as ezetimibe have helped to first, enhance the efficacy of existing treatments of hypercholesterolemia, second, increase the number of patients meeting defined levels of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and third, halt the progression of atherosclerotic disease. Considerable evidence supports the concept that cholesterol uptake by enterocytes involves several transport proteins. Their exact number, identity, and role remain ambiguous, however. The present article focuses on recent advances in our understanding of these proteins and supplements recent reviews dealing with the intestinal absorption of dietary sterols [1–3,4].

## Sources, absorption and metabolism of cholesterol: a brief overview

Cholesterol is known to have a number of important biological functions: first, it is an essential component of cellular membranes, where it modulates fluidity, permeability, raft formation and protein functions; second, it serves as a precursor of steroid hormones, vitamin D and bile acids; and third, it plays a role in transcriptional gene regulation. In the gastrointestinal tract, daily cholesterol is derived from the diet (300–500 mg), bile input (800–1200 mg) and desquamated cells (300 mg). The intestinal digestion of cholesterol does not differ greatly from that of other dietary fats in so far as bile salts and pancreatic

enzymes in the small intestine are required for micelle formation and enzymatic hydrolysis. The cholesteryl ester hydrolyzing enzyme, cholesterol esterase, releases free cholesterol and fatty acid, which are solubilized by bile acid micelles. Until recently, it was assumed that cholesterol diffused passively through the enterocyte brush-border membrane (BBM). It is now understood, however, that a protein-dependent process is required for its uptake. Several transporters have been identified, including fatty acid translocase/cluster determinant 36 (FAT/CD36), scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), Niemann Pick C1-Like1 (NPC1L1), the ATP Binding Cassette transporter family including several cholesterol carriers (ABCA1, ABCB1, ABCG5/ABCG8), caveolin-1 (CAV1) and annexin-2 (ANXA2) (Table 1). After crossing the BBM, cholesterol is intracellularly processed as shown in Fig. 1.

### Intestinal cholesterol transporters

Significant progress has been made in recent years in elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of intestinal cholesterol absorption. Important insights have been gained through the use of genetically-modified animal models, particularly gene knockout and overexpressing mice.

#### SR-BI

SR-BI, an 82-kDa protein, is expressed in enterocyte BBM mainly at the top of intestinal villosities and in the proximal part of the intestine where cholesterol absorption mainly occurs. The pioneering work of Hauser *et al.* with rabbit BBM has shown that cholesterol uptake is reduced after the addition of blocking anti-SR-BI antibodies or competitive ligands of SR-BI such as apolipoprotein (apo) A-I [5]. Confirmation of these data has been obtained in human intestinal organ culture, where SR-BI antibodies lowered cholesterol uptake. Furthermore, stably transfected human Caco-2 cells, generated by constitutive antisense RNA technology, displayed simultaneously low SR-BI expression and decreased ability to capture labeled cholesterol [6]. The importance of SR-BI in intestinal cholesterol absorption has been questioned, however, given the opposite results obtained from mice [7] and absorptive cells [8] with a disrupted SR-BI gene. In order to obtain new data on the role of SR-BI in cholesterol absorption, transgenic mice overexpressing SR-BI primarily in the intestine have been developed. With the transgene containing the mouse SR-BI gene under the control of the human intestinal specific apo C-III enhancer coupled with the apo A-IV promoter, SR-BI intestinal overexpression was found to increase the intestinal absorption of cholesterol [9**]. The results of overexpression studies may be more relevant than gene-deletion studies if alternative cholesterol transporters are able to compensate for the absence of the SR-BI protein.

#### CD36

FAT/CD36 (translocase), a human analogue of SR-BI, is a ‘multiligand’ widely expressed on the plasma membrane of cells performing active cholesterol turnover (i.e., in liver and steroidogenic tissues) or long-chain fatty acid (FA) uptake (i.e., in intestine and muscle). CD36-null mice given a fat bolus by gavage or fed a high-fat diet displayed first, an accumulation of neutral lipid in the proximal intestine, second, defective triacylglycerol secretion by their enterocytes, and third, slow clearance of intestinally derived lipoproteins [10], suggesting an impaired ability of CD36-null enterocytes to target alimentary FAs to the endoplasmic reticulum for triacylglycerol esterification. Confirmatory results have recently been obtained by Tso *et al.*, who reported significantly reduced lymphatic transport of dietary cholesterol and reduced apoB-48 and chylomicron assembly in CD36 knockout mice [11**]. Divergent findings, however, such as the lack of differences in the amount of dietary cholesterol accumulating in the intestine of CD36 knockout compared with wild-type mice, have put into question the role of CD36 in cholesterol uptake. Therefore, caution should be exercised until additional work is carried out to unequivocally demonstrate that CD36 is required for efficient intestinal cholesterol absorption.

#### Caveolin-1/annexin-2

Caveolae, the 50-nm to 100-nm invaginations at the cell surface, are abundant in various cells and participate in multiple cellular functions, including endocytosis, transcytosis, cholesterol transport and signal transduction [12]. According to many investigators, CAV1, the major structural protein of caveolae, may represent the sensor molecule for transporting excess cholesterol clustered in plasma membrane caveolae to the endoplasmic reticulum. This mechanism would facilitate the displacement of membrane cholesterol by absorbed dietary cholesterol. In addition, it has been reported that CAV1 forms a heterocomplex with ANXA2 that can be disrupted by the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe in enterocytes, suggesting a possible role for CAV1 and ANXA2 in cholesterol absorption [13]. At present, debate persists about the presence and the function of CAV1 in intestinal cholesterol trafficking in view of the success [14,15] and failure [6,16] of numerous investigators in revealing CAV1 in absorptive cells. Contrary to the prevailing opinion, recent studies strongly argue that the microvillar membrane is organized into stable lipid raft microdomains [17]. Finally, knockout mice studies have shown that the deletion of CAV1 does not result in abnormal cholesterol absorption and fecal neutral sterol excretion or irregular mRNA and protein levels of ANXA2 in proximal intestinal mucosa [18]. Additionally, oral administration of ezetimibe was effective in decreasing cholesterol absorption in CAV1 null mice and wild-type controls. These results suggest that CAV1 is not required

Figure 1 Intracellular network required for cholesterol and lipid transport

![Diagram](attachment:intracellular_network.png)

Free cholesterol, plant sterols, monoacylglycerols, lyso-phospholipids and fatty acids, carried by bile salt mixed micelles in the intestinal lumen, cross the unstirred water layer and are captured by specific proteins within brush-border membranes of the jejunum considered as the optimal segment for lipid absorption. Whereas NPC1L1, viewed as the most putative transporter, mediated the uptake of digestive cholesterol and plant sterols, physiologically excessive amounts are secreted back to the intestinal lumen via the apical membrane of the enterocyte by the ABCG5/G8 heterodimer. Similarly, ABCA1, localized on the basolateral surface, contributes to cholesterol homeostasis by promoting cholesterol efflux to plasma apo A-I, which enhances the formation of nascent HDL. Following the transfer of lipolytic products to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), local acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase 2 (ACAT-2) catalyzes the esterification of cholesterol, while monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT)-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) complex recycles fatty acids and monoacylglycerols into triacylglycerols (TG), and phosphoglyceride-synthesizing enzymes intervene in phospholipids (PL) formation. Under the action of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), lipids are then assembled with newly synthesized apo B-48 to generate chylomicrons (CM). These lipoprotein particles are then conveyed in specialized vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus with the crucial participation of Sar1b GTPase. They are finally exocytosed after the fusion of Golgi vesicles and basolateral membrane. Aberrations in lipid transporters (i.e. NPC1L1), key proteins (apo B-48, MTP, Sar1b) or esterifying enzymes reduce intracellular cholesterol transport and impact on circulating cholesterol concentrations.

for cholesterol uptake or ezetimibe sensitivity in mice; nevertheless, they do not exclude the involvement of CAV1 and ANXA2 in intracellular cholesterol trafficking.

### NPC1L1

Although HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have had a major impact in preventive cardiology, a large percentage of patients are not able to reach recommended LDL-cholesterol target levels. The development of ezetimibe has enhanced cardiovascular disease therapy by effectively lowering plasma cholesterol by an additional 15–25%. Ezetimibe specifically inhibits the transport of cholesterol and phytosterols across the BBM of enterocytes by blocking the transport function of its molecular target, NPC1L1 [19]. This critical protein has been found to be abundantly expressed in animal small intestine, and mice deficient in NPC1L1 have been shown to have markedly reduced sterol absorption.

Using a radio-ligand binding assay, Garcia-Calvo *et al.* definitively established NPC1L1 as the direct target of ezetimibe *in vivo* [20]. Indeed, these investigators demonstrated that ezetimibe could not bind to membranes from NPC1L1-deficient mice, whereas it was able to associate with native intestinal membranes and cells, indicating a specific binding interaction between NPC1L1 and ezetimibe.

Given the limited biochemical and morphological evidence for the presence of NPC1L1 in the human gut, our group has provided further insight into NPC1L1 localization and function in human intestinal tissue. We have carried out immunocytochemical, cellular fractionation and molecular studies in intestinal explants and in cultured human intestinal Caco-2 cells [21**]. Our data have revealed NPC1L1 predominance in the jejunum and enrichment in Caco-2 cells. We detected NPC1L1 at

the BBM using cell fractionation and high-resolution immunoelectron microscopy. NPC1L1 was also found to reside in subcellular compartments of the human enterocyte, including lysosomes and mitochondria. Our findings, including the inactivation of NPC1L1 (which clearly led to defects of cholesterol transport), have helped to confirm that NPC1L1 functions as a cholesterol transporter in human enterocytes.

### Aminopeptidase N

Labeling of enterocyte BBM with photo-reactive ezetimibe analogues has led to the identification of an additional membrane protein that may play a role in cholesterol absorption [22]. Exhaustive purification and sequencing revealed that a 160-kDa ezetimibe-binding protein was the membrane-bound protein aminopeptidase N (APN). Preincubation of confluent CaCo-2 cells with ezetimibe led to a strong decrease of fluorescent plasma membrane APN staining with a monoclonal antibody. These observations by Kramer *et al.* suggest that binding of ezetimibe to APN blocks cholesterol endocytosis by membrane microdomains, thereby limiting intestinal cholesterol absorption. It should be noted, however, that these studies did not include a quantitative comparison of binding between recombinant proteins and BBM, and neither did they report deletion of the putative target in genetically modified mice as reported by Garcia-Calvo *et al.* for NPC1L1 [20]. Obviously, more studies are needed to gain further insight into the precise role and molecular mechanism action of APN in intestinal cholesterol transport.

### ABC transporters

Members of the ATP-binding cassette protein (ABC) family have been clearly implicated in intestinal cholesterol transport.

#### ABCA1

First discovered as the defective gene in Tangier disease, ABCA1 seems to modulate not only cholesterol efflux from cells to apoA-I (contributing to the generation of mature HDLs), but also cholesterol export out of absorptive cells and back into the intestinal lumen [23] (Figs. 1 and 2). Several reports have provided substantial evidence that ABCA1 overexpression abolished net cholesterol absorption in animal models [24, 25], while others have yielded conflicting data showing a 60% increase in cholesterol absorption [26] or no effect on sterol excretion [27]. In addition, ABCA1 has been dominantly expressed on the basolateral surface of intestinal cells where it can efflux cholesterol on HDL particles [28–30]. Interestingly, a recent study has shown that ABCA1, especially in the absence of acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase 2 (ACAT2), can sustain cholesterol absorption [31]. Although Schaefer *et al.* documented similar cholesterol absorption in a compound heterozygote for Tangier disease and a healthy control, suggesting that the ABCA1 gene product may not play a significant role in intestinal cholesterol absorption in humans [32], the exact role of ABCA1 in cholesterol movement across the BBM is still unclear.

#### ABCG5/ABCG8

Sitosterolemia or phytosterolemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by hyperabsorption and impaired biliary secretion of cholesterol and plant sterols. These subsequently accumulate in tissues causing tendon xanthoma and premature coronary artery disease [33]. The disease appears to be produced by mutations in two half-size ABC transporters, ABCG5 and ABCG8, localized at the apical membrane of the enterocyte and at the canalicular membrane in the liver. When functional, these transporters unite to form a full, active transporter

**Figure 2 Contribution of various sterol receptors and transcription factors to enterocyte cholesterol homeostasis**

Cholesterol balance in intestinal absorptive cells is maintained by:

(i) net cholesterol uptake controlled by putative sterol receptors (NPC1L1, SR-BI, FAT/CD36, CAV1-ANX2, APN and ABCB1/Pgp);

(ii) efflux by apical ABCG5/G8 and basolateral ABCA1;

(iii) de-novo cholesterol synthesis by HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol esterification by ACAT-2;

(iv) cholesterol export by chylomicrons (CM), VLDLs and HDLs;

(v) lipoprotein internalization via specific lipoprotein receptors (LDL-R, VLDL-R), lectin-like oxidized-LDL receptor (LOX-R), and basolateral SR-BI; as well as

(vi) transcription factors regulating cholesterol homeostasis, such as LXR, RXR, PPAR, SREBP.

and limit the absorption of both plant sterols and cholesterol by actively pumping them from enterocytes back into the intestinal lumen. These transporters may also promote the elimination of sterols in the liver by enhancing their excretion into bile. Mice lacking *abcg5/abcg8* genes mimic the major phenotypes of human sitosterolemia [34]. On the other hand, transgenic mice over-expressing human ABCG5/ABCG8 in the liver and small intestine retain far fewer plant sterols in the body and have a compensatory upregulation of hepatic cholesterol synthesis rates due to increased biliary secretion and reduced intestinal absorption of cholesterol [35].

**ABCB1**

Human P-glycoprotein (Pgp) or ABCB1, encoded by the *mdr1* gene, is located in the upper villous region and is abundant in small-intestinal absorptive cells [36]. Although its main function consists of limiting the oral absorption of xenobiotics and environmental toxins by moving them from the intracellular to the extracellular domain, it has been suggested that it also participates in the absorption and intracellular trafficking of cholesterol. Support for this hypothesis derives from the direct interaction of Pgp with cholesterol [37], the influence of Pgp expression on the disposition and sterol-lowering effect of ezetimibe, and the interference of Pgp activity inhibitors with both cholesterol transport from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum and apo B secretion [14], which brings about a decrease in plasma cholesterol and atherosclerosis development in animal models [38]. Although data reported in these studies suggest that Pgp is involved in cholesterol transport within intestinal cells, the evidence remains circumstantial, particularly since Pgp inhibitors also induce nonspecific (i.e., Pgp-independent) effects. Thus, it is possible that these agents impede cholesterol transport from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum by mechanisms other than through Pgp inhibition.

**Cholesterol transporter polymorphisms**

Genomic DNA variants of enterocytic cholesterol transporters have been found to be associated with modifications in sterol absorption and circulating cholesterol levels. For example, the wide range of interindividual variation in LDL-cholesterol response to ezetimibe is probably due to amino acid sequence variants of NPC1L1, which influence cholesterol absorption and subsequently plasma LDL levels under physiological conditions [39**, 40, 41]. Screening for four rare amino acid polymorphisms (R174H, P282L, R306C, R417W) associated with variations in cholesterol absorption in familial hypercholesterolemia revealed that carriers of the R174H substitution, with high cholesterol absorption, exhibited the highest response to ezetimibe. On the other hand, patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, according to NCEP, were associated with a specific

ABCB1 haplotype, suggesting this polymorphism may contribute to increased plasma cholesterol and LDL levels [42]. ABCG8(A632V, T400K, Y54C) and ABCG5(Q604E) variants, however, are likely to be important for the genetic determination of plasma cholesterol levels, probably via their influence on intestinal absorption and biliary secretion [43–45]. Finally, several variants of SR-BI [46] and more than 100 mutations and many single nucleotide polymorphisms of ABCA1 [47, 48] have been detected, but studies have not been performed to assess the effects of these genetic variants on cholesterol absorption.

**Regulation of intestinal cholesterol transporters by transcription factors**

Liver nuclear X receptors (LXR) act as oxysterol sensors of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis [49]. LXR and LXRβ form obligate heterodimers with retinoid receptors, retinoic X receptors (RXRs), and are bound and activated by a class of naturally occurring oxysterols [50, 51]. RXR/LXR heterodimers activate their target genes by binding to specific response elements (LXREs) that contain a hexanucleotide direct repeat separated by four nucleotides [52]. The role of LXRs in the intestine has been well documented, especially in the regulation of cholesterol absorption and excretion by the ABC transporters, including ABCA1 [23, 53], ABCG1 [54], and ABCG5/ABCG8 [55] (Fig. 2). For example, mice treated with an LXR agonist have decreased fractional absorption of dietary cholesterol [23]. Whereas the inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption first correlated with *ABCA1* gene expression, subsequent evidence showed that ABCA1 is in some way involved in LXRα-dependent basolateral cholesterol efflux from the enterocyte [25, 28, 29]. Since then, ABCG5 and ABCG8 have been shown to mediate the effects of LXR agonists [56], but the relative contributions of the liver (increased biliary cholesterol secretion) and intestine (apical cholesterol excretion) to the increased fecal neutral sterol excretion have not been distinguished. Recently, it has been revealed that LXRs seem to govern dietary cholesterol fate in the enterocyte by downregulating apical absorption through NPC1L1 [57*].

Analogous to the situation described with LXR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) constitute a subgroup of the nuclear receptor superfamily, designated PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ, all of which serve functions in lipid homeostasis and energy metabolism. Recently, it has been demonstrated that PPAR activation reduced cholesterol absorption efficiency in wild-type mice without any change in intestinal *Abca1*, *Abcg5*, or *Abcg8* expression, suggesting a decrease in NPC1L1 [58].

Another nuclear receptor target gene is SR-BI, which is under the control of LXR-regulated and PPAR-regulated transcriptional events. Studies still need to be carried out

to evaluate the influence of nuclear factor-mediated SR-
BI stimulation on intestinal cholesterol transport. Even if
LXRs are increasingly implicated as novel pharmacologi-
cal targets, their stimulatory action on hepatic sterol
regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1C) lead-
ing to hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis [59,60]
calls for caution. The successful development of LXR-
based therapeutics requires strategies to exploit the
beneficial aspects of LXR activation while avoiding
any unwanted side effects.

### Intracellular trafficking of cholesterol
transporters

In addition to apical surface localization, intestinal cho-
lesterol transporters have been detected in intracellular
compartments. For example, NPC1L1 has been observed
in endosomes, perinuclear regions, lysosomes and mito-
chondria of the human intestine [21**,61*]. SR-BI has in
turn been shown to accumulate in cytoplasmic lipid drop-
lets and was noted in tubulovesicular membranes, con-
sistent with receptor trafficking between the apical surface
and interior of enterocytes [17]. CD36 has been found in
the Golgi apparatus [62] and CAV1/ANXA2 has been
found unassociated with BBM domains [18]. Additionally,
a relationship between NPC1L1 transporter intracellular
trafficking and cholesterol uptake has been documented
[61*]. Indeed, NPC1L1 was observed in endocytic recy-
cling compartments, where cholesterol depletion resulted
in relocation of NPC1L1 to the plasma membrane [61*].
Similarly, SR-BI has been found to be mainly localized in
the microvillar membrane of enterocytes in the fasting
state, but was endocytosed during absorption of dietary fat
[17]. These findings suggest the possibility that intestinal
cholesterol transporters may act intracellularly, mediating
the movement of cholesterol from BBM to various orga-
nelles. In particular, they may assist in the shuttling of
cholesterol from BBM to the endoplasmic reticulum
where the incoming cholesterol represents the major
source of substrate for ACAT and restrains HMG-CoA
reductase activity [63,64] (Fig. 2). More studies are clearly
required to help understand the molecular mechanism of
intestinal transporter-mediated cholesterol trafficking and
regulation.

### Conclusion

Elucidation of mechanisms responsible for regulating
enterocyte cholesterol uptake is relevant for the preven-
tion of cardiovascular diseases, given the significant
positive correlation between plasma LDL-cholesterol
concentrations and the efficiency of intestinal cholesterol
absorption. Development of the cholesterol absorption
inhibitor ezetimibe has been very fruitful in providing
evidence that first, a drug can efficiently lower plasma
cholesterol by blocking intestinal cholesterol absorption,
and second, that intestinal cholesterol absorption is
dependent on protein-mediated processes, not just pass-
ive diffusion. Considerable effort has subsequently been
devoted to the identification of proteins localized at the
BBM of intestinal cells, which might be involved in
regulating cholesterol transport into and out of entero-
cytes, but to date their specific role and regulation, as well
as their contribution to cholesterol homeostasis, have not
been clearly defined. Future studies need to determine to
what extent these intestinal cholesterol transporters act
independently or in a coordinated fashion. It is more than
likely that an increased knowledge of these proteins will
rapidly translate into novel and effective therapeutic
agents. The design of such novel, powerful drugs specifi-
cally targeting BBM cholesterol carriers, by inhibiting
influx and enhancing efflux of alimentary and biliary
sterols, may lower hypercholesterolemia and reduce car-
diovascular diseases.
