Classical views posit G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor 1s (CB1Rs) at the cell surface with cytosolic Giα-mediated signal transduction. Hebert-Chatelain et al. (2016) instead place CB₁Rs at mitochondria limiting neuronal respiration by soluble adenylyl cyclase-dependent modulation of complex I activity. Thus, neuronal bioenergetics link to synaptic plasticity and, globally, learning and memory.

Irrespective of a cell’s degree of specification within any mammalian tissue, its O₂-respiring mitochondria are the sources of bioenergy. Mitochondria originate from bacteria (Taanman, 1999) with their circular DNA coding for 37 prokaryote gene homologs. However, mitochondria contain ~1,500 proteins in mammals (Chacinska et al., 2009), which are encoded by the nuclear genome, synthesized in the cytosol, and imported through at least 4 pathways into mitochondria (Chacinska et al., 2009). An unexpected variety of steroid, neuropeptide, and neurotransmitter receptors, including those for glucocorticoids, estrogen, androgens, thyroid hormone, prostaglandins, N-methyl-D-aspartate, and acetylcholine (Lee et al., 2008), is present in mitochondria to modulate cellular respiration.

Endocannabinoids, like prostaglandins, are arachidonic acid-derived signal lipids whose intracellular pools can serve as metabolic intermediates to satisfy the cell’s metabolic demands (Nomura et al., 2011). Endocannabinoids bind type 1 and 2 cannabinoid receptors (CB₁R/CB₂R) in many organ systems. CB₁R and CB₂R are members of the superfamily of GPCRs and considered as cell-surface signaling proteins. While a decade-long consensus suggested strict cell-type-specific expression rules for CB₁R (being “neuronal”) and CB₂R (considered “glial”) in the brain, the use of sophisticated genetics shifted this view (Han et al., 2012), favoring receptor heterogeneity as a determinant of signal integration and outcome. Besides cell-surface GPCRs, endo- and phytocannabinoids (from *Cannabis sp.*) can also target intracellular receptors or binding sites: N-acylethanolamines activate nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, and anandamide recognizes an intracellular binding site in TRPV1 channels (van der Stelt et al., 2005).

The exclusive cell-surface targeting of CB₁R is the dogma that Giovanni Marsicano and his colleagues challenged in a series of thought-provoking studies in the recent past (Bénard et al., 2012; Hebert-Chatelain et al., 2016) by placing this GPCR into neuronal mitochondria. They localized CB₁Rs to the outer membrane of mitochondria (“mtCB₁R”), and signal transduction analysis revealed reduced cyclic-AMP concentrations and subsequent inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) and complex I activities (Bénard et al., 2012) leading to reduced neuronal respiration. Moreover, they showed that cell-impermeant CB₁R antagonists and agonists (hemopressin and biotinylated HU210, respectively) only partially modify endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic plasticity, implying the participation of mtCB₁Rs through altering energy availability in situ (Bénard et al., 2012). Now, their most recent study (Hebert-Chatelain et al., 2016) critically advances existing knowledge on mtCB₁R signaling by identifying intricate mechanistic details.

From in silico predictions, they reveal that a 22 amino acid-long sequence in its N terminus (N1–22) significantly increases the probability of mitochondrial CB₁R targeting and import. In elegant rescue experiments using reintroduction of full-length versus N-terminally-truncated CB₁Rs on a *Cnr1*⁻/⁻ background, they show critical differences in neuronal respiration upon stimulation with synthetic cannabinoid agonists and phytocannabinoids. Most notably, they find that exclusion of CB₁Rs from mitochondria blocks cannabinoid-induced amnesia. Through detailed signal transduction analysis (Figure 1), a case for cannabinoid-induced mtCB₁R activation releasing Gaᵢ proteins, inhibition of soluble adenylyl cyclase, and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the complex I NDUFS2 subunit is presented. Since both constitutively active PKA and phosphomimetic NDUFS2 prevent cannabinoid-induced amnesia (Hebert-Chatelain et al., 2016), mtCB₁Rs are identified as gatekeepers of bioenergetic pathways whose activity is indispensable for the activity-dependent coordination of neuronal network output.

The findings by Hebert-Chatelain et al. (2016) certainly provoke a variety of questions, many of which could individually revise chapters in the exciting history of (endo-)cannabinoid research. First, they posit that an internal 22-residue N-terminal sequence drives CB₁Rs to the mitochondria. The most common protein import pathway in mitochondria uses peptide targeting “presequences,” which fall outside the N-terminal protein coding region, and are recognized by the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex (Chacinska et al., 2009). An alternative mechanism relies on non-cleavable signals in the protein sequence, including N-terminal signal-anchor sequences recognized by a putative insertase of the mitochondrial outer membrane (Mim1) (Chacinska et al., 2009). Considering the localization of, and

The classical GPCR processing pathway relies on gene transcription in nucleus, protein translation, and processing on polyribosomes and in the ER-trans-Golgi complex, respectively. Protein orientation but not intermediate steps on small transport vesicles is shown. Upon insertion in the plasma membrane with their N terminus facing extracellularly, CB₁Rs can initiate manifold signaling pathways through Gi/o proteins. This typically involves the sequential inhibition of adenyl cyclase (AC) and protein kinase A (PKA). Less-frequent Gs coupling is not shown. Recently, Marsicano and colleagues proposed ([Bénard et al., 2012; Hebert-Chatelain et al., 2016]) that a subcellular pool of CB₁Rs (1) target to mitochondria (“mtCB₁Rs”) with its N1-22 sequence facilitating mitochondrial import. Whether CB₁Rs naturally lacking N1-22 exist remains unknown. The exact mitochondrial import machinery for CB₁Rs is also elusive (2) even if a Mim1-dependent mechanism might be prioritized. mtCB₁Rs localize to the outer mitochondrial membrane ([Bénard et al., 2012]). However, whether they form homo- or heteromultimers, like plasmalemmal CB₁Rs, is another open question (3). Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) acts on mtCB₁Rs and reduces cellular ATP availability, and thus respiration. (4) Mitochondrial Gi proteins co-immunoprecipitate with and are released upon mtCB₁R activation, and inhibit soluble AC (sAC), suggesting signaling in the intermembrane space. How partitioning of key signal proteins changes upon cell state and mtCB₁R activity to support signaling needs further analysis (5). Cannabinoids then decrease PKA-dependent phosphorylation of complex I proteins, particularly NDUFS2. Dissecting mtCB₁R signal specificity on complex I proteins will be critical to exploit this pathway for therapeutic benefit. Considering that constitutively active PKA as well as phosphomimetic NDUFS2 rescue the effects of cannabinoids on mitochondrial respiration and block cannabinoid-induced amnesia in vivo, a direct link between mtCB₁Rs, neuronal bioenergetics, and higher brain functions emerges.

NDUFS2 subunit. GPCRs are thought to operate in multimers: CB₁Rs can co-assemble with, e.g., dopamine, serotonin, and adenosine receptors and undergo G protein switching. Cell-surface CB₁Rs are known to sequester Ga, thus rendering other GPCRs signal incompetent ([Vásquez and Lewis, 1999]). Considering the many other receptors localized to mitochondria, it will be interesting to resolve if signaling interactions at the receptor or G protein levels could modulate respiratory output. Another degree of complexity comes from regional differences in the brain since in hypothalamic neurons CB₁R-controlled mitochondrial respiration was enhanced ([Koch et al., 2015]) rather than suppressed as seen in hippocampal neurons ([Hebert-Chatelain et al., 2016]). In the hypothalamus, mtCB₁R action was associated with UCP2, which itself is tied to the acute control of complex behaviors ([Hermes et al., 2016]). Whether and how the differential effects of mtCB₁R signaling can be reconciled at the signaling and cellular levels and how these relate to specific neuronal output patterns will require further analysis.

Besides endocannabinoids, Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) also modulates mtCB₁Rs. Thus, it is appealing, and of chief human relevance, that episodic amnesia upon cannabis smoking might arise from THC limiting neuronal respiration: “switching off” neuronal activity and erasing synaptic plasticity. Nevertheless, the effects of mtCB₁Rs on postmitotic and stationary adult neurons might be less than under developmental conditions. Cell division, migration, and neurite outgrowth by far surpass energy demands of any mechanism studied so far. Consequently, reliance on mtCB₁Rs might predominate during both pre- and postnatal developmental periods. As such, mitochondria accumulate at the active growing ends of microtubules, and these processes are particularly sensitive to CB₁R modulation. Therefore, future studies on mtCB₁Rs might uncover molecular substrates by which even episodic cannabis use during pregnancy or lactation could permanently modify neuronal connectivity, glial support, and sensitivity to secondary insults in the offspring’s nervous system.

Another exciting finding of the [Hebert-Chatelain et al. (2016)] report is the cascade of phosphorylation steps leading to the control of complex I, particularly its

N-terminal prediction for, mtCB₁Rs, the latter mechanism might be favored, yet its molecular principles remain unknown (Figure 1). Notably, [Hebert-Chatelain et al. (2016)] predicted ~40%–50% probability for the mitochondrial import of CB₁Rs. While this is strikingly higher than that of CB₂Rs (<1%), it is still significantly lower than that for proteins considered as “mitochondrial proteins” (e.g., for NDUFS2 it is >95%). Thus, one prevailing question is whether the likelihood of CB₁R recruitment to mitochondria could depend on cell states, neuronal activity, or pathologies. Furthermore, the process of CB₁R sorting toward mitochondria versus cell surface seems to emerge as a rate-limiting step to generate functionally distinct intracellular CB₁R pools.

Historically, epitope tagging of the N terminus of the CB₁R was preferred given concerns toward C-terminal modification.

skin, and pancreas. Linking cannabinoid signaling with cellular bioenergetics shows particular promise to resolve existing therapeutic shortcomings related to the control of secretory processes, cell renewal, cell motility, and resilience against the many environmental stressors modern humans experience during our ever-expanding lifespan. It will therefore be crucial that conceptual advances and ideas in this field of mitochondria research are adequately matched with technological advances and the development of quality-controlled tools to ensure enduring success.
