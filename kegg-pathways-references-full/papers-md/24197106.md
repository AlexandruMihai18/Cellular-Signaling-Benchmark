Abstract. Cell-suspension cultures of *Ascochyta rabiei*-resistant (ILC 3279) and -susceptible (ILC 1929) chickpea (*Cicer arietinum* L.) cultivars were compared with regard to their elicitor-induced accumulation of pterocarpan phytoalexins and increases in the activities of biosynthetic enzymes. The growth performances and protein patterns of the two cell-culture lines were essentially identical. Treatment of cell cultures with a polysaccharide elicitor from *A. rabiei* induced fivefold-higher amounts of the phytoalexins medicarpin and maackiain in the cells of the resistant than in the susceptible cultivar. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and eight enzymes representing the general phenylpropanoid pathway, the flavonoid-forming steps and the pterocarpan-specific branch of phytoalexin biosynthesis were found to be elicitor-induced. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and chalcone synthase reached sharp, transient optima some 8 h after elicitor application in the cells of both cultivars. The activities of isoflavone 2′- and 3′-hydroxylases were only induced in cells of the resistant cultivar with a maximum after 8 h. Cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase, chalcone isomerase, 2′-hydroxyisoflavone reductase and pterocarpan synthase showed a later or no sharp optimum. The isoflavone-specific 7-O-glucosyltransferase was not induced in either cell-culture line. Cells of the susceptible cultivar failed to induce significant activities of isoflavone 2′-hydroxylase and these cells produced only very low amounts of phytoalexins. Isoflavone 2′-hydroxylase is postulated to be the main limiting enzyme for pterocarpan biosynthesis in cells of the susceptible cultivar. The pterocarpan biosynthetic pathway in chickpea cells represents a suitable model for investigations of differential gene activation in connection with the expression of antimicrobial defence reactions.

### Introduction

Chickpea (*Cicer arietinum* L.) is a widespread crop plant in semiarid areas of Asian and North African countries. An important pathogen of chickpea is the necrotrophic fungus *Ascochyta rabiei* (Pass.) Lab. (teleomorph: *Mycosphaerella rabiei*) which mainly infects leaves of the host plant (Nene 1982). The disease, called “Ascochyta blight”, causes great losses in crop production; therefore, intensive breeding programmes at International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas, Aleppo, Syria (ICARDA) and International Crops Research Institute for the Semiarid Tropics, Patancheru, India (ICRISAT) aim at obtaining resistant chickpea races (Saxena and Singh 1984).

In this laboratory the resistant chickpea cultivar ILC (international legume chickpea) 3279 and the susceptible cultivar ILC 1929 have been chosen for analyzing the biosynthesis and enzymology of preinfectional secondary compounds and postinfectional phytoalexins (Barz et al. 1988). Phytoalexins are assumed to play an important role in the plant defense response against fungal pathogens (Bailey and Mansfield 1982; Dixon 1986).

Chickpea plants constitutively accumulate the isoflavones biochanin A and formononetin, mainly as 7-O-glucoside-6″-O-malonate esters, and after infection the two pterocarpan phytoalexins medicarpin and maackiain are formed (Köster et al. 1983a; Weigand et al. 1986; Barz et al. 1988).

Scheme of metabolically linked pathways (phenylpropane metabolism, isoflavone conjugation reactions, pterocarpan-specific biosynthetic branch) in chickpea cell-suspension cultures, with formononetin as the central intermediate for pterocarpan phytoalexin formation. The isoflavone pratensein is a natural constituent of chickpea

Cell-suspension cultures of the resistant and the susceptible cultivar showed identical patterns in the accumulation of isoflavone conjugates (Kessmann and Barz 1987). After application of a glucan-elicitor isolated from the mycelium of *A. rabiei*, cells of the resistant cultivar accumulated amounts of medicarpin and maackiain about fivefold higher than cells of the susceptible cultivar (Kessmann et al. 1988a). This cultivar-specific difference in phytoalexin accumulation was previously also found with the intact plants (Weigand et al. 1986).

The phytoalexin biosynthetic pathway, from phenylalanine to the stage of an isoflavone (Fig. 1), has been well elucidated at the biochemical, enzymatic and molecular-biological level (Hahlbrock and Scheel 1989). The 5-deoxyisoflavone formononetin is the central interme-

mediate and link between the general phenylpropanoid and isoflavonoid pathways and the subsequent specific part of phytoalexin formation (Smith and Banks 1986). Recently, the enzymology of the specific part of pterocarpan biosynthesis (Fig. 1) has been elucidated using chickpea cell-suspension cultures. Formononetin is first hydroxylated in positions 2′ and 3′ by two isoflavone-specific cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases (Hinderer et al. 1987). 2′-Hydroxy-formononetin and 2′-hydroxypseudobaptigenin are then reduced to the corresponding isoflavanones in a stereospecific reaction by the isoflavone reductase (Tiemann et al. 1987; Schlieper et al. 1990). The terminal enzyme, pterocarpan synthase (PTS), closes the dihydrofuran ring and leads to the end products (−)-medicarpin and (−)-maackiain (Bless and Barz 1988; Kessmann et al. 1988b).

In previous studies, we were able to demonstrate that the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase (CHS) substantially increased after application of an elicitor to the cell cultures of the resistant cultivar (Daniel et al. 1988). The cell cultures used for these investigations grew on a medium containing yeast extract, which itself possesses elicitor activity (Kessmann and Barz 1987). We have now replaced the yeast extract with the amino acid glycine (Kessmann 1988) and thus obtained an excellent cell-suspension culture for studying elicitor-induced changes in enzyme activities.

We now report on the time courses of such elicitor-induced changes in enzyme activities in the cell cultures established from the *A. rabiei*-resistant and -susceptible chickpea cultivars. The activities of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Glc6PDH), PAL, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (CH4), CHS, chalcone isomerase (CHI) and UDP-glucose 7-O-glucosyltransferase (IGT) (general part) as well as 2′- and 3′-isoflavone 2′(3′)-hydroxylase (2′ and 3′-IHD), NADPH: isoflavone oxidoreductase (IFR) and PTS (specific part of pterocarpan biosynthesis) have been measured. The results provide evidence for differential regulation of the activities of the early and the specific enzymes and also reveal marked differences between the cells of the resistant and the susceptible cultivars.

### Material and methods

#### Chemicals. Materials for the preparation of protein extracts and enzyme assays were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, FRG), Sigma (München, FRG) and Serva (Heidelberg, FRG). *p*-Coumaroyl-CoA was synthesized as described by Stöckigt and Zenk (1975). [2-¹⁴C]Malonyl-CoA (Amersham Buchler, Braunschweig, FRG) was diluted with unlabelled malonyl-CoA to a final specific radioactivity of 0.66 GBq·mmol⁻¹. Biochanin A was obtained from EGA-chemie (Steinheim, FRG) and formononetin from Roth (Karlsruhe, FRG). Isoliquiritigenin was obtained from the collection of the institute. 2′-OH-Formononetin and vestitone were synthesized according to Dewick (1977).

#### Cell cultures. Cell-suspension cultures of *Cicer arietinum* L. cultivars ILC 3279 and ILC 1929 (obtained from ICARDA, Aleppo, Syria) were grown in a modified PRL 4c-medium in 200-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 40 ml medium as described by Kessmann and Barz (1987). The yeast extract was replaced by glycine (2 mg·l⁻¹). The cultures were grown in darkness on a rotary shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, New Brunswick, NJ, USA; 120 rpm) at 25°C and subcultivated weekly.

#### Elicitor preparation and application. The strain of *Ascochyta rabiei* used for elicitor preparation was obtained from Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures, Baarn, Netherlands (CBS-number: 543.65) and cultivated as described by Kraft and Barz (1985). The elicitor was prepared from fermenter-grown mycelium according to Kessmann and Barz (1986).

A sample of 3 mg elicitor was dissolved in 1 ml water. This solution was autoclaved and added aseptically to the cell cultures. The controls were supplied with 1 ml sterile water.

#### Preparation of enzyme extracts. All protein extracts were prepared from fresh cells which had been separated from the medium by filtration.

(i) Preparation of extracts for determination of Glc6PDH (EC 1.1.1.49.), PAL (EC 4.3.1.5.), CHS (EC 2.3.1.74.) and CHI (EC 5.5.1.6.) activities. Four g cells, 2 g Dowex 1 × 2 (phosphate form), 1 g quartz sand and 8 ml buffer (100 mM KH₂PO₄/K₂HPO₄, pH 8.0, 1.4 mM mercaptoethanol) were homogenized in a mortar at 4°C. After centrifugation (RC2-B, refrigerated centrifuge, SS 34-rotor; Sorvall, Newton, Conn., USA) for 15 min at 26000·g the supernatant was directly used for the enzyme assays.

(ii) Preparation of extracts for determination of IGT activity. The crude protein extract (see above) was fractionated by ammonium-sulfate precipitation (Daniel et al. 1988). The fraction obtained from 35–80% saturation was used for the assay of IGT activity (Köster and Barz 1981).

(iii) Preparation of extracts for determination of IFR and PTS activities. Four g cells, 0.4 g polyclar AT, 2 g quartz sand, 7 ml buffer A (50 mM KH₂PO₄/K₂HPO₄, pH 8.0, 1 mM dithioerythritol) were homogenized in a mortar at 4°C. After centrifugation (see above) for 15 min at 26000·g, 2.5 ml of the supernatant was desalted through a Sephadex G-25 column using buffer A and the eluate was assayed for IFR. An aliquot of 2.5 ml of the supernatant was desalted through a Sephadex G-25 column using buffer B (50 mM KH₂PO₄/K₂HPO₄, pH 7.5). The eluate was used for PTS assays.

(iv) Preparation of extracts for determination of C4H (EC 1.14.13.11.) and 2′ and 3′-IHD activities. Microsomes were prepared as described by Hinderer et al. (1987) and used for the assays.

#### Assays of enzyme activities. The activities of Glc6PDH, PAL, CHS, CHI and IGT were measured as described earlier (Daniel et al. 1988). The C4H activity was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) according to Köster et al. (1983a, b). A linear gradient of 20–50% acetonitrile (in 1.5% H₃PO₄) in 30 min was used. Compounds were detected at 290 nm. Activities of IFR and PTS were assayed according to Tiemann et al. (1987) and Bless and Barz (1988); 2′- and 3′-IHD were assayed according to Hinderer et al. (1987) using the substrates formononetin and biochanin A, respectively.

The time courses have been shown to be reproducible and the increases of all enzyme activities to be statistically significant by several independent experiments.

#### Protein determination. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (1976) using bovine serum albumin as reference.

#### Determination of isoflavones and phytoalexins. Extraction of isoflavones, isoflavone conjugates and phytoalexins were carried out according to Köster et al. (1983a, b) and Kessmann and Barz (1987). For determination of compounds the extracts were analyzed by HPLC and detected at 287 nm as described by Köster et al. (1983a, b) and Kessmann and Barz (1987).

**Results**

The cell-suspension cultures established from the chickpea cultivars ILC 3279 (resistant) and ILC 1929 (susceptible) showed identical growth parameters (i.e., increase of fresh weight; protein content). Furthermore, the protein patterns obtained by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of crude protein extracts revealed no appreciable differences between the cells of the two cultivars (data not shown). This observation of essentially identical patterns of the constitutively expressed proteins is an important prerequisite for comparing the results obtained after addition of an elicitor.

The *A. rabiei* elicitor was applied to the cell cultures at the beginning of the linear growth phase (day 3). Dose-response analyses of elicitor activity in the culture ILC 3279 showed that 3 mg elicitor per cell culture flask was an optimal amount for phytoalexin accumulation (data not shown). The time course of the elicitor-stimulated accumulation of medicarpin and maackiain and the induction of a sequence of biosynthetic enzymes were investigated during a period of 48 h after elicitation. We chose six enzymes directly or indirectly involved in the general part of pterocarpan biosynthesis, namely Glc6PDH, belonging to the pentosephosphate pathway, PAL and C4H from the general phenylpropanoid route, CHS and CHI which catalyze flavanone formation, and IGT as it is involved in isoflavone conjugation. Furthermore, 2′- and 3′-IHD, IFR and PTS which represent the specific part of phytoalexin biosynthesis were included in the analyses. Figure 2 shows that the activities of Glc6PDH, PAL, C4H and CHS increased in the cells of both cultivars as a result of elicitor application. The increase in Glc6PDH activity up to 12 h was slightly higher in the ILC 3279 cells. In both cell culture lines, PAL activity showed a distinct optimum 8 h after elicitor application. In cells of the resistant cultivar the increase of 570% was lower than in cells of the susceptible cultivar where it amounted to 730%. In contrast, the activities of C4H and CHS increased to significantly higher levels in cells of cultivar ILC 3279 than in cells of the susceptible cultivar. In the cell culture ILC 3279, C4H showed a stable maximum from 4–48 h whereas this enzyme activity showed a transient maximum after 24 h in the cells of the susceptible cultivar. The activity of CHS reached a maximum between 8 and 12 h in the cells of both cultivars.

Interestingly, and in contrast to the findings with the culture from the susceptible cultivar, the activities of Glc6PDH, PAL, C4H and CHS in the ILC 3279 culture did not reach their constitutive levels until 48 h.

Chalcone isomerase showed a differential induction (Fig. 2). In cells from the resistant cultivar a large increase with a broad maximum after 16 h was found whereas in the ILC 1929 cell line no significant induction of CHI activity was observed.

The enzyme IGT catalyzes the glucosylation of biochanin A and formononetin. Previous experiments had shown enzyme induction at this stage which connects conjugation metabolism with phytoalexin biosynthesis (Jaques 1988; Kessmann et al. 1988a; Daniel et al.

intact plants (Weigand et al. 1986), has repeatedly been observed with these chickpea cell cultures (Jaques 1988; Kessmann 1988) and it is considered to be a stable cultivar-specific property. Furthermore, the accumulation of maackiain was always found to be three-five-times lower than the accumulation of medicarpin. After reaching a maximum the amounts of phytoalexins progressively decreased within the next 8 h. Earlier studies in this laboratory (Kessmann and Barz 1987; Jaques 1988) have already demonstrated that the pterocarpanes, after excretion into the growth medium, are slowly degraded by extracellular peroxidases.

Application of *A. rabiei* elicitor to the chickpea cell cultures did not lead to any browning reactions of the cells. Furthermore, the increase of fresh weight and the protein content of the cells were not influenced by the elicitor.

### Discussion

Cell-suspension cultures of the *A. rabiei*-resistant (ILC 3279) and -susceptible (ILC 1929) chickpea cultivars showed quantitatively very different elicitor-induced accumulations of phytoalexins (Fig. 4), essentially as previously observed for the intact plants when they were infected with spores (Weigand et al. 1986). The cells of the resistant cultivar accumulated strikingly higher amounts of these defence compounds than the cells of the susceptible cultivar. Since phytoalexins are assumed to play an important role in the antimicrobial defence system of plants (Darvill and Albersheim 1984; Dixon 1986) such a cultivar-specific difference in phytoalexin expression deserves special attention. Any biochemical data explaining this difference will therefore contribute to a better understanding of the role of phytoalexins in the total spectrum of the defence reactions.

The biosynthetic pathways leading to medicarpin and maackiain and the essential enzymes involved in these routes are completely known (Fig. 1). The total pathway may be divided into three parts, i.e. the general phenylpropanoid route, the isoflavone-forming steps together with isoflavone conjugation metabolism, and the terminal pterocarpan-specific part (Barz et al. 1988). Except for the enzyme catalyzing the formation of the methylene dioxyring of maackiain, all enzymes as mentioned in Fig. 1 have been characterized in chickpea. Therefore, investigations of the regulation of phytoalexin biosynthesis at the level of enzyme activities using different chickpea cultivars and their cell-suspension cultures are now possible. Inspection of Figs. 2–4 reveals that all enzymes of the complete pathway ranging from Glc6PDH to the terminal PTS are subject to elicitor induction, though decisive quantitative differences between the cells of the two chickpea cultivars seem to exist.

The chickpea cell suspensions used in the present investigations contained in their medium the amino acid glycine instead of yeast extract (Kessmann 1988). This change in the composition of the nutrients led to the special advantage that, upon transfer into new medium, the cells were not regularly induced for phytoalexin formation as a consequence of the elicitor activity of the yeast extract (Kessmann and Barz 1987; Kessmann et al. 1988a; Daniel et al. 1988). These newly established cell-culture lines were identical with regard to growth, cell-

lar protein content and gel-electrophoretically determined protein patterns. Our present data indicate that these cell-suspension cultures may be used to detect cultivar-specific differences in the expression of defense reactions.

Upon elicitation, Glc6PDH, the first enzyme of the pentose-phosphate pathway, was readily induced in the cells of both cultivars (Fig. 2). Previous investigations (Daniel et al. 1988) had demonstrated that, except for Glc6PDH, several other enzymes of primary metabolism were not influenced by elicitation in chickpea cells. Likewise, infected hypocotyls and roots of soybean also showed an increase in Glc6PDH activity (Börner and Grisebach 1982; Bonhoff et al. 1986). Such results may indicate that Glc6PDH is indirectly involved in pterocarpan biosynthesis by providing intermediates for phenylalanine and nucleotide formation. However, in other cases, such as hypocotyls and cell cultures of French bean (Robbins et al. 1985) or cell cultures of *Arachis hypogaea* (Rolfs et al. 1987), Glc6PDH activity was not increased by infection or elicitation.

The enzymes of the general phenylpropanoid pathway (PAL, C4H) and of flavonoid formation (CHS, CHI) all responded to elicitation by a substantial increase in their activities (Fig. 2). Maximum values for PAL and CHS activities were reached some 4 h before the maximum of phytoalexin accumulation, whereas C4H and CHI activities increased more slowly. Similar

observations have been reported for several phytoalexin-accumulating plants and cell cultures such as French bean (Bolwell et al. 1985; Robbins et al. 1985), soybean (Ebel et al. 1984) and parsley (Chappell et al. 1984).

The elicitor-induced enzyme activity of PAL was found to be much higher in cells of the susceptible cultivar than in cells of ILC 3279 (Fig. 2) in spite of the low phytoalexin accumulation in the cells of cultivar ILC 1929. These data, our previous observations (Daniel et al. 1988) and reports from other laboratories (Grisebach et al. 1985; Smith and Banks 1986) all indicate that PAL is not the main regulatory or rate-limiting enzyme in phytoalexin biosynthesis. The PAL reaction is involved in other pathways, i.e. lignin biosynthesis or formation of cell-wall-bound phenolics which have not yet been investigated in our chickpea cell-suspension cultures.

Cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase and the flavanone-forming enzymes CHS and CHI showed higher elicitor-stimulated activities in the cells of the resistant cultivar than in the cells of the susceptible genotype. In the case of CHI the comparatively very high constitutive level of this enzyme (Fig. 2) must be mentioned since it will possibly prevent an induction process in cells of the susceptible cultivar.

Callus cultures of *Medicago sativa* (lucerne) established from pathogen-resistant and -susceptible cultivars also showed specific differences in their response to elici-

tor-induced. The comparatively high constitutive levels of these enzymes in the chickpea cell cultures (Fig. 4) may indicate that these cells are partially stressed in the sense that these enzymes and other stress-induced proteins (Daniel 1989) are expressed at a low level under these growth conditions.

Comparison of Figs. 2–4 shows that enzymes located at the entrance of pathway sections, i.e. PAL, CHS and IHD (Fig. 1), are characterized by sharp, transient maxima 8–12 h after elicitor application. In contrast enzymes located within sections of pathways, i.e. C4H, CHI, IFR and PTS, respond more slowly with the expression of less-pronounced or no maxima. The regulatory pattern of differential gene activation in the total pterocarpan biosynthetic pathway as shown in Fig. 1 is presently under investigation (Daniel and Barz 1990) and will probably reveal further decisive differences between the resistant and the susceptible chickpea cultivars.
