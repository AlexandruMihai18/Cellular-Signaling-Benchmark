CD28-MEDIATED CO-STIMULATION:  
A QUANTITATIVE SUPPORT FOR  
TCR SIGNALLING  

Oreste Acuto and Frédérique Michel  

The ability of naive T cells to clonally expand and acquire effector functions depends on the strength of signals received by the T-cell receptor (TCR) and by an array of co-stimulatory receptors — the most prominent of which is CD28. In this review, we discuss recent genetic, biochemical and biophysical data that indicate a modified view of the molecular mechanism by which ligation of CD28 amplifies TCR-mediated T-cell activation. These studies indicate that the commonly held notion of a qualitative signalling role of CD28 in T-cell activation should be revised.

TWO-SIGNAL HYPOTHESIS  
The two-signal hypothesis was proposed as a mechanism to explain how lymphocyte stimulation by antigen induces an immune response or unresponsiveness. Briefly, the signal delivered by the antigen receptor alone could promote tolerance whereas development of an immune response requires a 'second signal' from a soluble or membrane-bound co-stimulatory factor.

T-cell responses to antigen are directed by immunogenic and tolerogenic stimuli¹ that can be divided into two main categories. First, the signal relayed through the ligation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) by peptide–MHC complexes, which is essential for removing T cells from quiescence (G₀ phase) and preparing them for proliferation and differentiation. The second subset of stimuli, generally referred to as co-stimuli, are conferred by counter-receptors expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or by soluble factors such as cytokines and chemokines. Co-stimuli might or might not coincide spatially and temporally with the peptide–MHC stimulus and crucially contribute to upregulated synthesis of macromolecules and energy metabolism, to promote cell-cycle progression, protect from or enhance cell death and regulate cell differentiation. Co-stimuli, therefore, drive and control T-cell numbers and fates. Identified in the early 1980s, the membrane receptor **CD28** (BOX 1) was found to enhance TCR-induced proliferation and differentiation of naive T cells. These properties indicated that it could be the much sought-after receptor that was responsible for ‘signal two’ predicted by the TWO-SIGNAL HYPOTHESIS of lymphocyte activation². CD28 or its ligands B7.1 (**CD80**) and B7.2 (**CD86**) (BOX 1), which are expressed at high levels by activated professional APCs³, were considered to be possible targets for manipulating the immune response,

because many T-cell responses are markedly compromised in both CD28-deficient and CD80/CD86-deficient mice³⁴. The CD28-mediated signal was thought to qualitatively complement the TCR signal by activating unique pathways and transcription factors. Here, we briefly review studies that illustrate the important role of CD28 as a regulator of gene-expression programmes that are activated at the onset of an immune response, and discuss recent data on the membrane-proximal signalling mechanism that is activated by ligation of CD28. These investigations indicate that, although connected to the intracellular signalling machinery through unique determinants of its cytoplasmic tail, surprisingly, CD28 only activates a few of the signalling effectors that are shared by the TCR. Moreover, biochemical and biophysical changes induced by CD28-mediated signals are integrated with those that are induced by the TCR at a membrane-proximal, rather than nuclear level. Finally, CD28 signalling might be partially or totally dispensable and amplifies signalling pathways and gene-expression profiles that are activated by the TCR alone. We discuss these data that question qualitative models of CD28 signalling and propose that CD28 functions mainly as a quantitative supplier that is required to overcome signalling thresholds that are not attainable by ligation of the TCR alone.

Box 1 | CD28 and CD80/CD86 molecules: expression profiles and biochemistry

- CD28 is an integral membrane protein homodimer, the extracellular region of which contains one immunoglobulin-like domain. In human T cells, CD28 and the T-cell receptor (TCR) are expressed at ~6 × 10⁴ and ~2 × 10⁴ molecules per cell, respectively. CD28 is expressed by most mouse T cells, 90% of human CD4⁺ T cells and 50% of human CD8⁺ T cells.
- B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86) — the two structurally homologous ligands of CD28 — are expressed by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and activated B cells, belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and might exist as dimers and monomers, respectively.
- CD80 is virtually absent in non-activated DCs, whereas CD86 is expressed at a low level. Expression of both can be upregulated by infection, tissue injury, the production of inflammatory cytokines or after contact of APCs with activated T cells, with the upregulation of CD86 expression preceding the expression of CD80.
- CD80 and CD86 expression by activated DCs *in vitro* — that is, DCs stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or CD40-specific antibodies, for example — can increase up to ~5 × 10⁴–10⁵ molecules per cell or more. In solution, CD28 binds to CD80 and CD86 with affinities of 4 μM and 20 μM, respectively; binding is characterized by high on- and off-rate constants.
- No marked difference has been found in the biochemical modifications induced in T cells by CD80- or CD86-triggering of CD28. Mice that are deficient for either CD80 or CD86 show that they have partially overlapping functions. Differences in expression kinetics between CD80 and CD86 might explain the functional differences that have been observed. CD86 might be required for initiating immune responses, whereas CD80, which is expressed later, might be crucial for regulating immune responses, perhaps by interacting preferentially with cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4).

Biological consequences of CD28 co-stimulation

**Position of the CD28-mediated signal.** CD28-deficient mice or mice treated with antagonists of CD28-CD80/CD86 interactions have reduced responses to an array of immune challenges, including infectious pathogens<sup>5–8</sup>, allograft antigens<sup>9</sup>, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)<sup>10</sup>, contact hypersensitivity<sup>11</sup> and asthma<sup>12</sup>. Correspondingly, lack of CD28-mediated co-stimulation results in reduced T-cell proliferation *in vitro* and *in vivo*<sup>13–15</sup>, in severe inhibition of germinal-centre formation and immunoglobulin isotype-class switching<sup>16,17</sup>, reduced T helper (T<sub>H</sub>) -cell differentiation and the expression of T<sub>H</sub>2-type cytokines<sup>18,19</sup> (FIGS 1 and 2). CD4-dependent cytotoxic CD8⁺ T-cell responses are also affected<sup>20</sup> (FIGS 1 and 2). Compromised T-cell-mediated responses are equally observed in mice that lack both CD80 and CD86 (REFS 21,22). The potency and early time of delivery of the CD28 signal most probably explains these widespread effects. So, particularly at low TCR occupancy, CD28 is unique in providing a potent synergistic signal in naive cells to effectively activate transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)<sup>23</sup>, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)<sup>24,25</sup> and activator protein 1 (AP1)<sup>26</sup>, which control cell proliferation, death and differentiation. **CD2** or the β₂-integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (**LFA1**) — genuine T-cell co-stimulatory receptors of naive T cells — do not match the capacity of CD28 to increase the signal strength of activation<sup>27,28</sup>. CD2 has an optional co-stimulatory role that is seen better when T cells lack CD28 (REF. 29). LFA1 binds its ligands intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) expressed by APCs with an affinity similar to that of the CD28-CD80/CD86 interaction only after an activation signal (the ‘inside-out’ activation mechanism of LFA1)<sup>30,31</sup>. ICAM-mediated co-stimulation through LFA1 might, therefore, depend on CD28 signalling. CD28 signalling allows full expression of downstream regulators of the immune response that initiate and/or

control T-cell proliferation, death, differentiation and functional interactions with other cells (FIG. 1). So, CD28 signalling upregulates the expression of cytokines, for example, interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-4 (REF. 22); chemokines, for example, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP1α; CC-chemokine ligand 3, CCL3)<sup>32</sup>; receptors for cytokines and chemokines, for example, the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), IL-12R and CXC-chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5)<sup>5,33,34</sup>; and receptors such as CD40 ligand (**CD40L**), cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (**CTLA4**), inducible co-stimulatory molecule (**ICOS**), **OX40** and **4-1BB**, that will be ligated by their counter-receptor on APCs<sup>3,34</sup> (FIG. 2). These events ensure the delivery of a ‘second wave’ of signals (hours or days after the initial T-cell-APC encounter) in secondary lymphoid organs and/or after the migration to tissues, and are crucial for effector T-cell functions and the establishment of long-term memory.

**Control of cell cycle, survival and differentiation.** CD28-mediated signals potently enhance IL-2 production<sup>14,35</sup> and IL-2R expression<sup>5,22</sup>, and accelerate entry into and progression through the cell cycle<sup>36</sup>. However, IL-2, as well as other common cytokine receptor γ-chain-dependent cytokines, do not have an important role in antigen-driven T-cell proliferation *in vivo*<sup>37,38</sup> and *in vitro*, CD28-enhanced cell-cycle progression is partly IL-2 independent<sup>39</sup>. Unphosphorylated (inactive) retinoblastoma proteins (pRb) maintain cells in the G₀ phase of the cell cycle, in part, by repressing E2F transcription-factor-regulated genes<sup>40</sup>. Entry into the G₁ phase requires phosphorylation of pRb by active cyclin-D-cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)/CDK6 complexes, and progression to late G₁ and S phases depends on additional phosphorylation of pRb by cyclin-E-CDK2 complexes<sup>40</sup>. In resting T cells, CD28 signalling strongly upregulates the expression of D cyclins<sup>41,42</sup>, the activation of CDK4/CDK6 and pRb phosphorylation, but in apparent

absence of IL-2 (REF. 39), consistent with these events being detected as early as 3–4 hours after TCR/CD28 triggering<sup>43</sup>. Progression to the G<sub>1</sub> phase is negatively controlled by the CDK-interaction protein (CIP), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (KIP) and INK protein families that inhibit the activity of CDKs<sup>44</sup>. CD28 signalling increases the degradation of KIP1 by a phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway<sup>45</sup>. However, T cells from Kip1-deficient mice proliferate normally in response to TCR/CD28 stimulation<sup>42</sup>. Instead, the CDK inhibitor INK4C has an important role in maintaining T cells in the G<sub>0</sub> phase — a function that is thought to be antagonized by CD28 signalling to facilitate cell-cycle progression<sup>42</sup>. So, CD28 is likely to provide signals that modify the machinery that controls cell-cycle progression, but the biochemical basis of this pathway is unknown. During the G<sub>0</sub>-G<sub>1</sub> transition, T cells increase in cell mass<sup>46</sup> due to the expression of genes that upregulate the biosynthesis of macromolecules and increase energy metabolism of the cell — a process that is boosted by CD28 signalling as shown by analysis of gene arrays<sup>25</sup>. These pathways implicate, in part, mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR), which is controlled by PI3K<sup>47</sup>. The transcription factor c-MYC controls the expression of genes that are involved in translation initiation, the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and cell division (for example, E2Fs and CDC25)<sup>48</sup>, making it a possible target of CD28-mediated signals during the early phases of activation.

Stimulation of T cells by dendritic cells that express low levels of antigen and/or CD80/CD86 molecules

might lead to cell death due to inefficient induction of anti-apoptotic countermeasures or inhibition of cell-cycle progression<sup>49–51</sup>. T-cell death and inhibition of cell-cycle progression can both be overcome by CD28 co-stimulation<sup>52,53</sup>. Consistently, CD28 promotes the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-X<sub>L</sub><sup>54</sup> in a NF-κB-dependent manner<sup>55</sup> and repression of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor p73 that facilitates T-cell survival at the G<sub>1</sub> phase<sup>56</sup>. Moreover, overcoming anergy is linked to cell-cycle progression<sup>53</sup> promoted by CD28-mediated signals.

Transit through the cell cycle is crucial for determining T<sub>H</sub>-cell fate and the development of effector functions<sup>57–59</sup>, though differentiation and cell cycling can, in part, proceed independently of one another<sup>43,59,60</sup>. After a given number of cell divisions, T cells are irreversibly committed to become a T<sub>H</sub>1 or a T<sub>H</sub>2 cell if directed by the specific polarizing cytokines that are required for effective induction of the nuclear factors T-bet and GATA3, respectively<sup>59</sup>. Expression of GATA3 requires NF-κB<sup>61</sup>, consistent with the CD28-mediated signal favouring T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation<sup>43,18</sup>. Interestingly, concomitant ligation of CTLA4 that seems to counteract CD28-induced gene expression<sup>62</sup> favours T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation<sup>63</sup>. Consistently, in CTLA4-deficient T cells, CD28-mediated signals are more efficient, resulting in enhanced NF-κB activation, GATA3 expression and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation<sup>64</sup>. Together, these data illustrate the crucial effect of the CD28-signalling pathway on the signal strength that is required for naive T-cell proliferation and differentiation.

Perhaps a key to understanding a primary function of CD28 signalling comes from recent studies that indicate its role in early nuclear events of chromatin and epigenetic changes<sup>57,65–70</sup>. So, in naive T cells, re-positioning of the SWI/SNF-related chromatin-remodelling complex BAF occurs after only ten minutes of stimulation<sup>65</sup> and requires calcium influx, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and/or the RAS pathways, all of which are reinforced by CD28-mediated signals (see later). Moreover, CD28 strongly enhances the expression of the NF-κB-family member c-REL<sup>68</sup>, which is required for T-cell proliferation<sup>23,68</sup>. c-REL is induced through a cyclosporin-A (CsA)-sensitive (for example, NFAT-dependent) pathway<sup>25</sup> within 30–60 minutes of TCR/CD28 stimulation and promotes chromatin remodelling at the IL-2 gene locus (at the so-called, CD28-responsive element)<sup>23,68</sup>. Moreover, as early as 20 minutes after TCR/CD28 stimulation, cytosine demethylation at the IL-2 gene locus is induced in naive T cells<sup>69</sup>, suggesting a CD28-enhanced post-translational modification of a constitutive demethylase. Similarly, changes in accessibility of polarizing cytokine gene loci (for example, IFN-γ and IL-4) are detected one hour after TCR/CD28 stimulation<sup>59</sup> and begin to orchestrate events that guide and stabilize effector T<sub>H</sub>-cell fate. These data indicate that CD28 signalling contributes to changes of chromatin structure and DNA demethylation that are required for commitment to cell growth, cell-cycle entry and differentiation.

**Figure 1 | Physiological and signalling roles of CD28 co-stimulation.** The key role of CD28 in promoting full activation of naive T cells is illustrated by its direct effects (green panel) on gene activation, cell cycle and survival, and in inducing the expression of a second wave of membrane receptors by activated T cells and by CD28-mediated indirect (or long-range) effects (yellow panel) on clonal expansion and T-cell differentiation.

REVIEWs

IMMUNORECEPTOR TYROSINE-BASED ACTIVATION MOTIFS (ITAMs). Structural motifs that contain tyrosine residues, found in the cytoplasmic tails of several signalling molecules. The tyrosine residue in the Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Leu/Ile motif is a target for phosphorylation by SRC kinases and subsequent binding of SH2-domain-containing proteins such as ZAP70 and SYK.

GLYCOLIPID-ENRICHED MEMBRANE MICRODOMAINS (GEMs). Cholesterol-rich dynamic microdomains or 'lipid rafts' that provide ordered structure to the lipid bilayer and have the ability to include or exclude specific signalling molecules and complexes. GEMs are thought to be an important site for signal transduction.

Connecting TCR and CD28 signals

The TCR and CD28 are independent signalling units, and a biophysical and biochemical comparison shows differences in their signalling scope. An often ignored, but marked, difference between these two receptors is in their ligation conditions<sup>71</sup>. On-rates for CD28–CD80/CD86 interactions are much faster than peptide–MHC–TCR interactions, probably due to the 'lock-and-key' versus 'induced-fit' character of the two interactions, respectively<sup>30</sup>. However, although still relatively fast, off-rates for peptide–MHC–TCR interactions are much slower than CD28–CD80/CD86 off-rates<sup>30</sup>. Furthermore, the density of peptide–MHC ligands for a given TCR is often low (50–500 per APC) with respect to CD80/CD86 molecules (Box 1). So, the number of ligated CD28 molecules seems to be greater and more dynamic than the TCR, although stabilization of the CD28–CD80/CD86 interaction by avidity effects cannot be excluded — for example, the formation of a lattice, as indicated for the CD28 homologue CTLA4 (REF. 30). These distinct binding properties of peptide–MHC–TCR

versus CD28–CD80/CD86 might have consequences on the amplitude and persistence of the two signals. Furthermore, TCR and CD28 signals are connected to the intracellular signalling machinery in different ways. The TCR signals its ligation through IMMUNORECEPTOR TYROSINE-BASED ACTIVATION MOTIFS (ITAMs) that are present in ten copies distributed among its six CD3-ζ sub-units<sup>72</sup>, whereas CD28 signals are mediated through phosphorylated tyrosines (not part of an ITAM) and proline-rich motifs in its 41-residue cytoplasmic tail<sup>73</sup> (FIG. 3). Immediately after ligation (within seconds), both receptors use the SRC-family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) LCK (and/or FYN) for inducible phosphorylation of tyrosines present in their respective intracellular tails, perhaps as a consequence of re-localization of ligated receptors into GLYCOLIPID-ENRICHED MEMBRANE MICRODOMAINS (GEMs)<sup>74</sup>, in which active LCK resides<sup>75</sup>. In contrast to TCR triggering, CD28 signalling initiated by ligation of CD80/CD86 does not induce the activation of ζ-chain-associated protein 70 (ZAP70) and the phosphorylation of the linker for activation of

Figure 2 | CD28-enhanced expression of a ‘second wave’ of co-stimulatory receptors. CD28 occupies a top hierarchical status by inducing, upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, the expression of other co-stimulatory receptors that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and tumour-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)/TNF ligand (TNFL) superfamily. CD28, therefore, promotes the enhanced activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), survival of T cells and APCs, T helper 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2)-cell development and B-cell-mediated humoral responses. For example, CD40 ligand (CD40L) engages CD40 on activated APCs, resulting in a further increase of CD80/CD86 density and expression of OX40L. OX40-dependent signalling induces the expression of CXC-chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5) by activated T cells. Moreover, CD40L–CD40 interactions stimulate the expression of inducible co-stimulatory molecule ligand (ICOSL) by activated APCs that binds to ICOS on activated T cells. Expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) enhanced by CD28 should favour downregulation of the T-cell response and facilitate T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation. TCR, T-cell receptor.

Figure 3 | Signalling tails of CD28 and TCR-associated CD3 chains. The amino-acid sequence of the human CD28 cytoplasmic domain is shown in its dimeric form. Phosphorylated Tyr residues of the Tyr-Met-Asn-Met (YMNM) motif binds directly to the p85 adaptor subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the Asn residue is thought to be involved in the phosphorylation of VAV1. Activation of interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) and TEC depends mainly on the first, but also on the second, proline-rich regions (green). The immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of CD3 chains that are associated with the T-cell receptor (TCR) are phosphorylated on Tyr residues by LCK/FYN protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) after TCR stimulation, which allows association to the PTK ζ-chain-associated protein 70 (ZAP70). Tyr residues that are likely to be phosphorylated after ligation are shown in red.

T cells(LAT)-SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP76) complex<sup>76</sup>. The LAT-SLP76 complex is the basic organizer of TCR intracellular signalling in that it recruits and juxtaposes an array of additional adaptors and key enzymes that connect to all of the main signalling pathways<sup>72</sup> (TABLE 1, FIGS 4 and 5). A dynamic molecular complex is assembled to induce rapidly phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1)-mediated cleavage of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>), PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-mediated increase in the concentration of intracellular calcium and activation of most PKCs and RAS (through the diacylglycerol-recruited RAS guanosine exchange factor (GEF) RAS-guanosine releasing protein (GRP)<sup>77</sup> — a RAS activator that contains a diacylglycerol-binding domain. Concomitantly, SOS- and RAS-GRP-mediated and VAV1-mediated generation of active RAS-GTP and RHO family GTPases, respectively, also occurs. PI3K-modified PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> are generated during TCR triggering<sup>78</sup>, but how PI3K is physically recruited is unclear.

Immediate consequences of these events are the rearrangement of plasma-membrane and cytoskeletal components, reorientation of the MICROTUBULE ORGANIZING CENTRE (MTOC), accelerated intracellular vesicular trafficking, general and locus-specific chromatin changes that are concomitant with nuclear localization and the activation of transcription factors. The full repertoire of these cellular alterations is observed, to a certain extent, in T cells that are stimulated with TCR-specific antibodies crosslinked or immobilized to a solid support, creating conditions for strong and long-lasting TCR signalling. Although these experimental conditions do not occur in physiological conditions, they nonetheless indicate that the TCR signal, if strong enough, connects to all of the main gene-expression programmes<sup>25</sup>. By contrast, CD28 triggering alone results in the transient expression of only a few genes<sup>25,62</sup> and has no obvious biological consequences, indicating the subordinate role of its signal. As discussed earlier, under normal circumstances, only a few TCRs are ligated at once, a condition likely to generate short-lasting/incomplete activation events<sup>79</sup> that do not lead to cell proliferation and differentiation, but rather to anergy or cell death. If engaged, however, CD28 strongly amplifies a weak TCR signal (FIG. 6). What is then so special about the CD28-signalling mechanism? As mentioned earlier, CD28 is not a signalling alias of the TCR, yet, so far, no unique signalling pathways or effectors have been identified for CD28. Instead, all of the proteins identified as components of the CD28-signalling pathway constitute a small subset of those that are implicated in TCR-signal transmission (FIG. 5 and TABLE 2). These are PI3K<sup>80</sup>, the TEC PTKs<sup>81</sup> and IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK)<sup>82</sup>, VAV1 (REFS 83,84) and the serine/threonine kinase AKT (also known as PKB)<sup>76,85</sup>. As in vitro and in vivo data are most consistent with their crucial role in CD28 co-stimulation, we focus our discussion on them. The importance of other potential CD28-signalling effectors (TABLE 2) remains to be established in naive T cells.

**Activation of PI3K.** In spite of some earlier controversy, it is now clear that CD28 ligation alone in primary T cells activates the PI3K pathway, because it induces phosphorylation of the kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3α (GSK3α) and GSK3β<sup>25,45</sup>. This phosphorylation requires PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-activated AKT kinase and it is sensitive to inhibition by pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K<sup>25,45</sup>. This also implies PI3K-dependent activation of AKT by upstream PtdIns-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)<sup>86</sup>. When tyrosine phosphorylated, the Tyr-Met-Asn-Met motif in the cytoplasmic tail of CD28 binds the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (FIG. 3) and recent studies show that the tyrosine of this motif is required in primary T cells for the activation of AKT<sup>87</sup>, optimal IL-2-gene activation<sup>88</sup>, expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-X<sup>L</sup><sup>87,88</sup> and for the induction of an antigen response in vivo<sup>89</sup>. Activation of AKT links CD28 to at least two pathways that are crucial for controlling the expression of many genes during activation. One involves the NF-κB pathway through AKT cooperation with TCR-induced activation of PKCθ<sup>90,91</sup> and the other by GSK3α/GSK3β, which inhibits the nuclear export of NFAT<sup>92</sup>. CD28 signalling is implicated in cell-cycle progression<sup>45</sup> probably through AKT-controlled expression of transcription factors, such as Forkhead, c-MYC and the cyclin-D-CDK4/CDK6 complex<sup>48</sup>, but this remains to be formally shown. CD28-induced activation of AKT upregulates glucose metabolism<sup>93</sup> and perhaps other metabolic pathways that are required for augmented DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, and post-translational modifications.
Other pathways, such as those involving MTOR and PKC activation, should be regulated through CD28 as a consequence of PI3K-dependent activation of PDK1 (REF. 86).

**Activation of TEC kinases.** TEC and ITK are positively regulated by LCK- or FYN-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, by the PI3K product PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃ and by protein–protein interactions⁹⁴. VAV1 also regulates the activity of TEC and ITK by PI3K-dependent and -independent mechanisms⁹⁵. TEC and ITK are crucial for the production of secondary messengers through positive regulation of PLC-γ1, and, therefore, contribute to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, diacylglycerol-dependent activation of PKC and the activation of RAS/RAF/ERK through RAS-GRP. TEC and ITK seem to regulate Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) — a CDC42-activated protein that binds and activates the ARP2–ARP3 complex, which nucleates actin filaments⁹⁴. Because intracellular calcium levels affect acto-myosin-mediated cytoskeleton reorientation at T-cell–APC contacts⁹⁶, TEC and ITK might control actin-cytoskeleton reorganization at many levels. CD28 triggering induces the activation of ITK and TEC⁷⁶,⁸¹,⁸² through binding to the proline-rich regions in the CD28 amino- and carboxyl terminus (FIG. 3). In contrast to the TCR, ligation of CD28 alone does not induce the phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and increased intracellular calcium concentration⁷⁶, or activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)⁹⁷ and PKC-θ⁹⁰, indicating that functional effects of CD28-mediated activation of TEC and ITK depend on the TCR signal, which provides the signalling platform — the

LAT-SLP76 complex. Consistently, CD28-mediated enhancement of TCR-induced activation of PLC-γ1, increased intracellular calcium concentration, and NFAT activation is abolished by a mutation in the CD28 cytoplasmic tail that precludes ITK activation⁷⁶, and full T-cell activation in mice that express NFATc that is constitutively localized in the nucleus does not require CD28 co-stimulation²⁵,⁹⁸. Finally, a role for ITK in CD28 co-stimulation is implied by the defective T₂-cell responses in ITK- or NFATc-deficient mice⁹⁹,¹⁰⁰.

**VAV1: a key effector of co-stimulation.** VAV1 potently upregulates CD28-induced activation of NFAT²⁴, NF-κB and AP1 (REFS 101, 102). T cells that express CD28 in which the Asn residue of the Tyr-Met-Asn-Met motif is mutated are co-stimulation defective⁸⁸,¹⁰³,¹⁰⁴. In these cells, PI3K binding is unaffected, but tyrosine phosphorylation of VAV1 is abolished¹⁰⁴. VAV1 phosphorylation activates GEF activity by counteracting inhibitory constraints on the DBL-homology domain by the Pleckstrin homology domain¹⁰⁵. The mechanism of CD28-mediated membrane anchoring of VAV1 remains unclear, but does not seem to involve PI3K phospholipid products¹⁰⁶,¹⁰⁷ or docking of the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2)–VAV1 complex to the Tyr-Met-Asn-Met motif¹⁰⁸. Membrane recruitment and activation of VAV1 after TCR ligation requires the phosphorylation of SLP76 (REFS 109, 110), but SLP76 is not tyrosine phosphorylated after CD28 ligation⁷¹, indicating that the two receptors have different strategies for activating VAV1. Much evidence supports the main role of VAV1 in regulating almost all of the T-cell-signalling pathways¹⁰⁷ (FIG. 4). T-cell development is markedly reduced in Vav1-deficient

role of VAV1 in amplifying the TCR signal is largely due to its capacity, after it is activated through CD28, to synergize with phosphorylated SLP76 provided by the ligated TCR²⁴,¹⁰⁹,¹¹⁷. A CD28 mutant that is unable to activate VAV1 (and ITK) does not alter TCR-induced phosphorylation of ZAP70 and LAT, but affects SLP76, PLC-γ1 and ITK phosphorylation⁷⁶ and ATK activation (F.M., unpublished observations). This phenotype, which is markedly similar to that of VAV1-deficient T cells⁹⁵, supports a role for VAV1 as a crucial signalling effector of CD28 co-stimulation.

### Integration of CD28 and TCR signals

Biological responses controlled by many extracellular stimuli might require convergence of distinct intracellular signalling pathways. These integration processes are thought to occur preferentially at the level of gene enhancers/promoters, where combinations of transcription factors/co-activators regulate chromatin accessibility, specificity and levels of gene transcription¹¹⁸. Early studies proposed that TCR- and CD28-generated signals fitted into this scheme. So, T cells stimulated by CD28-specific antibodies and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) indicated that the CD28 signal was CsA insensitive¹¹⁹, with CsA inhibiting the cytoplasm-resident phosphatase calcineurin that allows dephosphorylation and nuclear entry of NFAT. Because TCR signalling is CsA sensitive, it was concluded that the TCR and CD28 used distinct signalling pathways. However, recent studies have questioned this view. CD28-specific antibody and PMA generate supra-physiological stimuli that bypass, for example, the requirement for c-REL and the CD28 response element⁶⁸,¹²⁰, which are essential for IL-2 gene expression in antigen receptor-stimulated cells⁶⁸,¹²⁰. Indeed, PMA over-facilitates accessibility to the IL-2 gene locus, creating conditions for non-physiological regulation of IL-2 gene expression⁶⁸. Moreover, recent investigations using more physiological stimulatory conditions indicate that CD28-enhanced gene expression is indeed CsA sensitive²⁴,²⁵, consistent with CD28 enhancing TCR-induced increase of intracellular calcium levels⁷⁶,¹²¹ and activation of NFAT⁷⁶. The CD28 signal was thought to be absolutely required for the production of IL-2 by targeting unique transcription factors to the CD28 response element, which is now recognized to include, perhaps sequentially, NFAT and c-REL–AP1 (REF. 23). In addition, activation of the NF-κB pathway is not exclusively dependent on CD28 as it is also activated (though weakly) after TCR ligation alone, consistent with low IL-2 production in the absence of CD28–CD80/CD86 interactions³. Instead, activation of the NF-κB pathway depends on the TCR signal, but it might be more dependent on CD28 co-stimulation than, for example, activation of NFAT²³. CD28 was also shown to be essential for stimulating the activation of c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) in a transformed T-cell line and important for AP1 activation¹²². However, naive T cells do not express JNKs, indicating that AP1 must be regulated differently in these cells,

mice, and the few thymocytes or T cells that do develop are defective in TCR-induced actin polymerization, TCR and GEM clustering¹¹¹,¹¹², integrin activation¹¹³, MTOC reorientation¹¹⁴, phosphorylation of AKT, TEC PTKs and PLC-γ1 and show poor recruitment of SLP76 to LAT⁹⁵. Also, nuclear import of NFAT, increased concentrations of intracellular calcium, and activation of NF-κB and RAS/RAF/ERK are strongly affected¹⁰⁷. VAV1-generated RAC-GTP might partly explain this phenotype, because RAC-GTP seems to control PI3K activation⁹⁵,¹¹⁵. These events then determine the activity of TEC PTKs, PLC-γ1, AKT and other key signalling elements¹¹⁶. Moreover, VAV1 stabilizes the complex protein-protein interactions that associate around the LAT-SLP76 complex⁹⁵, but certain defects in VAV1-deficient T cells might also arise from the loose spatial organization of the 'signalosome' due to defective cytoskeletal modifications. However, the

Figure 5 | TCR–LAT and CD28 signalling pathways. Ligation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) by peptide–MHC on an antigen-presenting cell (APC) triggers the recruitment of signalling elements (red) that are organized in complexes around the membrane scaffold protein linker for activation of T cells (LAT) that is resident in glycolipid-enriched membrane microdomains (GEMs). These signalling components ensure connection to the main pathways that control nuclear transcriptional and gene activation for example, phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) for the Ca²⁺ influx–nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway, protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) for the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP1) pathway, RAS-guanosine releasing protein (GRP) and the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2)-SOS complex for activation of RAS, and the VAV1-SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP76) complex for activation of RHO family GTPases. Assembly of the LAT-signalling scaffold is set in time and concentration by the level of TCR ligation, which is low under physiological situations due to low amounts of peptide–MHC on APCs. We hypothesize that this scaffold provides a structure on which CD28-signalling elements (yellow) can bind to and enhance TCR signals.

and recent data have shown that in pre-activated T cells, CD28 is not required for the activation of JNK¹²³. The fact that TEC PTKs and VAV1 control ERKs¹⁰⁷,¹²⁴ indicates a way in which CD28 might influence the activation of AP1 (REFS 26, 102). These data indicate that we should move away from the initial rigid model of biochemical signalling pathways that are controlled exclusively by CD28, to one in which integration of non-exclusive signalling inputs from CD28 merge with the TCR signal before nuclear events occur.

An important advance in our understanding of the molecular mechanism of CD28 co-stimulation has been the finding that CD28 mediates a direct effect on the intrinsic TCR-signalling capability in a TCR-proximal manner. So, inhibiting the CD28-CD80/CD86 interaction in a physiological setting of peptide-MHC recognition on professional APCs interferes with the phosphorylation of ZAP70 (REF. 125), indicating that ligation of CD28 controls proximal TCR-induced biochemical modifications. This effect is probably due to T-cell–APC membrane tethering mediated, in part, by the binding of CD28 to CD80/CD86, leading to facilitated TCR ligation⁷¹,⁷⁶. Using stimulatory TCR-specific and CD28-specific antibodies bound to beads, it was shown that CD28 helps to sustain general tyrosine phosphorylation that is concomitant with increased TCR-induced aggregation of GEMs¹²⁶. These effects, which operate several minutes after the initial triggering, might be due to CD28 facilitating actomyosin-dependent lateral transport of membrane components, resulting in receptor accumulation at the T-cell–APC interface⁹⁶. Moreover, other studies showed that CD28 signalling is essential for enhancing TCR-mediated early events (events that occur within seconds) such as the activation of PLC-γ1 and the consequent increase of intracellular calcium concentration⁷⁶.

How then, does CD28 mechanistically contribute to the TCR-activation signal? Probably, at many levels. CD28-CD80/CD86 interactions favour T-cell–APC
membrane apposition and TCR ligation (discussed in REF. 71), although these initial effects might not be exclusive of CD28, but also facilitated by CD2 (REFS 29, 127). Instead, biochemical modifications induced by the ligation of CD28 are most important. It has been suggested that CD28 might supply activated SRC kinases to amplify TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of immediate substrates<sup>126,128</sup>. This 'kinase promiscuity' model might, however, be expected to generate additive rather than synergistic effects that are observed early on by CD28 co-ligation (for example, increased intracellular calcium concentration)<sup>76</sup>. Moreover, CD28 signalling does not alter the intensity and duration of tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR-ζ and ZAP70 (REFS 76, 129), contrary to the prediction of this model. Another interesting possibility is that CD28 signalling corresponds to GEM coalescence<sup>126</sup>, as well as TCR- and intracellular-protein-clustering events<sup>130–132</sup>, depending on tyrosine phosphorylation, intracellular calcium increase and cortical actin remodelling<sup>131–133</sup>. CD28-mediated activation of both VAV1 and ITK/TEC kinases is likely to have an important role in these processes through their direct and indirect effects on cytoskeletal changes (FIG. 4). TCR clustering and GEM coalescence might be strategies to concentrate components of the signalling machinery while isolating them from the abundant membrane

phosphatase CD45, increasing the efficiency and duration of the combined TCR and CD28 signals. However, CD45 proximity to, rather than its exclusion from, GEMs is required during the initial phases of activation for positive regulation of LCK, which ensures 'acute phosphorylation' of the TCR<sup>75</sup> and CD28 (A.O. and F.M., unpublished observations). Aggregation of GEMs and exclusion of CD45 favoured by CD28 signals might stabilize signalling at a later stage (5–15 minutes) after activation<sup>126,134</sup>, and ensure signal propagation and its long-time persistence required for full T-cell activation<sup>135</sup>. Mechanistically, this might be achieved if CD28 ligation provides selective activated signalling elements that are not efficiently recruited by the TCR (whether at low or high occupancy)<sup>24,76,101,102</sup>. Signalling elements supplied by CD28 ligation might act as 'catalysts' and perhaps also as building blocks of the TCR-signalling machinery (see later) and enable functional thresholds to be overcome. In this context, it is interesting to emphasize the stoichiometric advantage of CD28 versus TCR ligation under normal circumstances of antigen presentation. Moreover, CD28 ligation seems to prolong the activation of LCK<sup>136</sup> and consequently the phosphorylation of VAV1 (REF. 83), whereas the TCR generates a more transient effect<sup>83</sup> (A.O. and F.M., unpublished observations). The molecular basis for the

Quantitative, qualitative or both?

It is clear that CD28 does not fit easily into a category of receptor that is expected to deliver a qualitatively unique second signal, at least as conceived from the original two-signal hypothesis². From a strict biochemical viewpoint, a 'qualitative' receptor would have at least one signalling element dedicated to it. In a pure qualitative model of co-stimulation, the expectation would be that no matter how high TCR occupancy is, no detectable biological response could be generated in the absence of CD28 ligation (FIG. 6, blue curve). Instead, as illustrated in figure 6 (green curve), attaining thresholds for generating certain complete or partial responses (for example, IL-2 production, proliferation, increased intracellular calcium concentration) is possible by TCR ligation at high occupancy only. So, within certain limits, CD28 is an optional receptor. This is also indicated by studies showing that CD28 ligation lowers the number of triggered TCRs that are required for a given response¹⁴⁰, and converts a partial or weak agonist peptide into a full agonist¹⁴¹. Moreover, in CD28-deficient mice, humoral responses to certain parasites or viruses, allograft rejection, GVHD and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses can occur, although they are reduced³,⁵,¹³. Similarly, expression of IL-2 and IL-2 receptor is reduced, but not abolished, in the absence of CD28–CD80/CD86 signalling¹⁴¹,¹⁴², and dependency on CD28 co-stimulation varies for the polarization of Tₕ1- versus Tₕ2-mediated responses¹⁴¹⁻¹⁴³. Models of T-cell clonal expansion and survival after IL-2 stimulation have been analysed recently using mathematical approaches, indicating that *in vitro*, the effect of IL-2 might be magnified, making co-stimuli seem obligatory¹⁴⁴. The demonstration that high doses and continuous delivery of antigen might compensate for lack of CD28 co-stimulation *in vivo*¹⁴⁵ is also consistent with the quantitative notion of co-stimulation.

A strong support for a quantitative view of co-stimulatory signalling comes from recent data from microarray analysis, showing that TCR-induced expression of several thousands of genes in primary T cells is amplified (or suppressed) to varying degrees by CD28 co-stimulation, but no new gene is induced by CD28 co-ligation²⁵,⁶². Figure 6 also illustrates the high demand for CD28-mediated signals to generate a response when TCR occupancy is low. It is conceivable that the latter situation is the most commonly experienced by a T cell — that is, low levels of peptide-MHC complexes and relatively strong CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation. However, it is also clear that, even at high occupancy, a TCR signal alone reaches a threshold that is not overcome in absence of CD28 signals (FIG. 6). This behaviour, deduced from both *in vivo* and *in vitro* data, indicates the existence of a qualitative component of CD28 signalling. Are we missing a CD28-dedicated signalling element? In this context, it is worth considering recent examples that indicate how sensitive signalling circuits and biological responses are, even to relatively small variations in the composition of high-order protein complexes. So, haploid insufficiency of the signalling adaptor GRB2 is enough to reduce the

property of CD28 in prolonging the phosphorylation of its direct targets is unknown. The key cooperative role of VAV1 as a structural component that is required for the stability of the signalosome⁹⁵ might bean *ad hoc* property of CD28 signalling in co-stimulation. So, a few ligated TCRs that are sufficient to build the first block of the signalling machinery might be helped by CD28 through a sustained supply of activated elements such as VAV1, TEC kinases and AKT that have pleiotropic effects to coordinate and sustain gene-transcription activation (FIG. 5). A similar mechanism is indicated by recent studies on **CARMA1** — an essential signalling component of the NF-κB pathway in lymphocytes and a potential modulator of the signal quality/sensitivity that might determine tolerogenic versus immunogenic outcomes¹,¹³⁷. CARMA1, similar to other MAGUK-type proteins, participates in sub-micron clustering of signalling complexes and accumulates in GEMs within 10–20 minutes after TCR triggering¹³⁸. By enhancing GEM coalescence¹²⁶, CD28 signalling might augment the recruitment of CARMA1 and activation of the NF-κB pathway. This mechanism, however, does not include the effects of CD28 co-ligation on increased intracellular calcium concentration. In this context, it is worth mentioning that ligation of CD28 can change the tempo of calcium influx from oscillatory (by TCR stimulation alone) to sustained¹²¹, and that different forms of calcium influx have differential effects on gene expression¹³⁹.
activation of TCR-induced mitogen-activated protein kinases JNK and p38, but not the activation of ERK, resulting in biologically important differences (for example, positive, but not negative, selection is affected)¹⁴⁶. Moreover, a point mutation in CARMA1, which is likely to abolish the interaction with some but not all of its targets, affects some (for example, TCR/CD28-stimulated production of IL-2), but not all of the biological responses that are controlled by the NF-κB pathway¹³⁷. These data indicate that by varying the composition of signalling proteins in high-order complexes and/or the timing of their assembly, the quality of the signal might change without the need for a special signalling component and pathway controlled by CD28.

**Conclusions**

The evidence discussed in this article indicate that although the TCR signal might provide the necessary minimal scaffolding from which the TCR intracellular

signalling is propagated, CD28 acts as an amplifier. Because TCR ligation allows the recruitment of essential signalling elements that connect to all of the main signalling pathways (FIG. 5), it is clear that such a scaffolding serves as the central highway for channelling chemical and structural information on which other elements provided by CD28 can be added. CD28, therefore, increases the potential of the TCR to signal fully even when interactions with peptide–MHC are poor. The proposed molecular models are certainly simplistic and have several gaps, a major one being that they do not provide a satisfactory explanation as to why CD28 signals seem to be mandatory for some biological outcomes of T-cell activation to be observed fully. Although this encourages us to keep searching for CD28-specific signalling components, advances favoured by genetic approaches¹³⁷,¹⁴⁶ and mathematical modelling¹⁴⁴ will certainly help to improve our present elementary view of co-stimulatory signals.

This paper provides evidence that CD28 signalling amplifies a cyclosporin-dependent pathway by activating a TEC protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) with consequent activation of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) and increase in calcium concentration. It supports the view that co-stimulation directly augments TCR-signalling capability (see also reference 125).

This paper describes a point mutation in CARMA1, which is associated with lipid rafts after immunoreceptor triggering (see reference 138), that affects some but not all of the signalling pathways in which NF-κB is implicated: an example of qualitative differences in biological response with a minimum change in the behaviour of a single signalling component (see also reference 146).
