Integrins are important mammalian receptors involved in normal cellular functions as well as pathogenesis of chronic inflammation and cancer. We propose that integrins are exploited by the gastric pathogen and type-1 carcinogen *Helicobacter pylori* for injection of the bacterial oncoprotein cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) into gastric epithelial cells. Virulent *H. pylori* express a type-IV secretion pilus that injects CagA into the host cell; CagA then becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src family kinases. However, the identity of the host cell receptor involved in this process has remained unknown. Here we show that the *H. pylori* CagL protein is a specialized adhesin that is targeted to the pilus surface, where it binds to and activates integrin $\alpha_{5}\beta_{1}$ receptor on gastric epithelial cells through an arginine-glycine-aspartate motif. This interaction triggers CagA delivery into target cells as well as activation of focal adhesion kinase and Src. Our findings provide insights into the role of integrins in *H.-pylori*-induced pathogenesis. CagL may be exploited as a new molecular tool for our further understanding of integrin signalling.

Integrins are cell adhesion receptors that mediate cell–cell, cell–extracellular matrix and cell–pathogen interactions${}^{1-7}$. Integrins exist as heterodimers of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subunits; in mammals there are 18 $\alpha$-subunits and 8 $\beta$-subunits identified that form 24 distinct heterodimers${}^{1-4}$. Integrin function is dynamically regulated by processes termed outside-in and inside-out signalling. Integrin-mediated cellular adhesion occurs at sites known as focal adhesions, where integrin signalling is mediated predominantly by the protein tyrosine kinases FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and Src${}^{1-4}$. Deregulation of integrin functions can be associated with diseases including chronic inflammation, heart failure and cancer${}^{1-4}$. Furthermore, a number of bacteria and viruses have been found to bind integrin receptors for adhesion to or invasion into host cells${}^{5-7}$. Here we report that the gastric pathogen *H. pylori* exploits integrin for injection of virulence factors into mammalian cells and simultaneous tyrosine kinase activation.

A wide range of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, including *H. pylori*, translocate virulence factors into host target cells by multi-subunit transport apparatuses known as type-IV secretion systems${}^{8,9}$. These type-IV secretion systems, which typically consist of a membrane-spanning secretion channel and an extracellular pilus, act as molecular syringes. The type-IV secretion system of *H. pylori* has attracted considerable interest because it is associated with the development of severe inflammation, peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer in humans${}^{9-13}$. The *H. pylori* type-IV secretion, encoded by a 40-kilobase *cag* pathogenicity island (*cagPAI*), injects the CagA oncoprotein as well as peptidoglycan into host cells, resulting in activation of NF-$\kappa$B and induction of potent pro-inflammatory chemokines such as interleukin (IL)-8 (refs 9–13). Translocated CagA undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by Src, leading to actin-cytoskeletal rearrangements, scattering and elongation of infected host cells in cell culture${}^{9-13}$. These phenotypic changes resemble those of malignant

cellular transformation and have been the subject of intensive studies${}^{9-13}$. The identity of the host cell receptor of the type-IV secretion system or the mechanism by which Src is activated during *H. pylori* infection are, however, unknown, hampering our understanding of the molecular mechanism by which *H. pylori* causes gastric ulcer and cancer.

**Integrin $\alpha_{5}\beta_{1}$ is involved in type-IV secretion of CagA**

To understand the molecular basis of CagA injection, we first investigated the subcellular localization of phosphorylated CagA (CagA-pY) shortly after attachment of *H. pylori* to AGS gastric epithelial cells using an antibody that recognizes CagA phosphorylated at the major phosphorylation site, tyrosine residue Y972 (ref. 14, Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). CagA-pY was found to co-localize with FAK or vinculin at the focal adhesions (Fig. 1a, arrows, and data not shown), suggesting that CagA is either rapidly recruited to or injected across the host plasma membrane at the sites of focal adhesion. This led us to examine whether integrins, which are present in focal adhesions${}^{1-4}$, might be the host receptors involved in the injection of CagA. The first line of evidence came from the observation that the *Escherichia coli* strain HB101 that expresses the integrin-$\beta_{1}$-binding *Yersinia* invasin InvA (HB101 $invA^{+}$)${}^{6}$ inhibited CagA phosphorylation in AGS cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a), whereas wild-type HB101 had no effect on CagA phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus, InvA might be able to block injection of CagA by competing with the type-IV secretion apparatus of *H. pylori* for binding to integrin $\beta_{1}$ and in particular the $\beta_{1}$-chain integrin member $\alpha_{5}\beta_{1}$, which is abundantly expressed in AGS cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). In accordance with this hypothesis, the integrin $\beta_{1}$ and $\alpha_{5}$ function-blocking antibodies AIIB2 and BIIG2, respectively, inhibited both *H.-pylori*-induced CagA phosphorylation and AGS cell scattering and elongation (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c), indicating that integrin $\beta_{1}$ and $\alpha_{5}$ are

required for injection of CagA by *H. pylori*. Furthermore, no phosphorylation of CagA was seen in *H.-pylori*-infected integrin-β₁ knockout mouse fibroblasts (GD25)¹⁵, whereas CagA phosphorylation was restored in GD25 fibroblasts in which integrin β₁ was re-expressed (GD25β1A) (Fig. 1b). The presence of CagA and CagA-pY in the cytosol of infected GD25β1A cells but not GD25 cells (Fig. 1b) further confirms that integrin α₅β₁ is required for the type-IV secretion and phosphorylation of CagA during *H. pylori* infection of host target cells.

### CagL is expressed on type-IV secretion pili

Many integrin ligands such as fibronectin and vitronectin carry the arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) motif, which serves as a recognition site for integrins¹⁻⁴. Sequence analysis indicated that CagL, a protein highly conserved among pathogenic *H. pylori* strains, is the only *cagPAI*-encoded gene product that contains an RGD motif (Fig. 2a). Deletion of *cagL* significantly diminished the ability of *H. pylori* to induce secretion of IL-8 by host cells¹², indicating that CagL is essential for pathogenesis. We postulated that CagL might function as an interacting partner of integrin β₁ during type-IV secretion. Immunofluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed that CagL is indeed expressed on the surface of *H. pylori* (Fig. 2b, c). Notably, within only 30 min of contact of *H. pylori* with AGS cells, numerous needle-like pili (100–200 nm in length) appeared on the bacterium in a CagL- and RGD-dependent manner (Fig. 2d–f and Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). CagL was found abundantly on these pili. Representative examples from 60 randomly selected pili are shown (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 5a); they are reminiscent of the agrobacterial and *H. pylori* type-IV secretion apparatus⁸,⁹,¹⁶. These structures were clearly not flagella, because pilus formation and CagL surface exposure were also observed in infections with the flagella-deficient mutant *H. pylori ΔflaA* (data not shown). In contrast, neither pilus formation nor CagL surface expression was seen in infections with ΔvirB7, ΔvirB10 or ΔvirB11, *H. pylori* mutants that are defective in type-IV secretion (data not shown).

immunogold labelling showed the presence of CagA signals at the tips of these pili, supporting the theory that CagA is delivered through these surface appendages (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 5b). Taken together, these findings led us to propose that CagL may function in an RGD-dependent manner as a sensor or adhesin on the *H. pylori* type-IV secretion pilus surface to trigger the injection of CagA on contact with host cells.

#### Functional role of CagL and its RGD motif

To investigate whether the RGD motif in CagL has a functional role in the injection of CagA, we infected AGS gastric epithelial cells with wild-type *H. pylori* and *cagL* mutants. A single amino acid substitution in the RGD motif, where either the aspartate or glycine residue is substituted by an alanine residue (CagL(RGA) or CagL(RAD), respectively), was sufficient to abolish CagA translocation into the cytosol, tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA, as well as the elongation phenotype (Fig. 3a–d). Complementation of the *H. pylori ΔcagL* deletion mutant with wild-type *cagL*, but not *cagL*(RGA) or *cagL*(RAD) mutants, restored the various phenotypes (Fig. 3a–d). These observations suggest that the RGD motif of CagL has an essential role in translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA. Furthermore, the CagL-derived RGD peptide c-(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Leu-Ala-), but not the control RAD peptide c-(Arg-Ala-Asp-D-Leu-Ala-), complemented the ability of the *H. pylori cagL*(RAD) mutant by approximately 40–50% in triggering phosphorylation of CagA and phenotypic responses (Fig. 3d), as well as pilus formation (Supplementary Fig. 4d). These findings strongly suggest that the RGD motif is essential for the concomitant activation of both

type-IV secretion and phosphorylation of CagA. They rule out the scenario where CagA is translocated by an RGD-motif-independent mechanism and the RGD peptide merely induces phosphorylation of the translocated CagA.

**CagL binds integrin α₅β₁ in an RGD-dependent manner**

Recombinant wild-type CagL bound to purified integrin α₅β₁ with a higher affinity (dissociation constant (*K*<sub>d</sub>) of 0.09 ± 0.02 μM) and higher association and dissociation rates as compared with mutant CagL(RGA) (*K*<sub>d</sub> of 0.36 ± 0.11 μM) (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs 6 and 7). These observations suggest that CagL is able to interact directly with purified integrin α₅β₁ *in vitro* in an RGD-motif-specific manner. The affinities and specificities of integrin–ligand interactions *in vivo*, in contrast to those *in vitro*, are influenced by factors such as inside-out signalling, integrin clustering and receptor crosstalk¹⁻⁴. Indeed, CagL bound to cell-surface-expressed integrin α₅β₁ with even greater affinity and specificity as compared with the *in vitro* interaction, as indicated by the following observations. First, latex beads coated with CagL bound abundantly to AGS cells but only poorly to integrin-β₁ knockdown cells (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 8a–c). Second, the binding of CagL(RGA)-coated latex beads to AGS cells was significantly reduced as compared to wild-type CagL (Supplementary Fig. 8a–c). Third, CagL-coated beads co-localized with integrin β₁ on binding to AGS cells (Supplementary Fig. 9a), whereas the integrin β₁ signal was often weak or undetectable with CagL(RGA)-coated beads (Supplementary Fig. 9a, right panel). Fourth, the function-blocking antibodies BIIG2 and AIIB2 against α₅β₁ integrins as well as the CagL-derived RGD peptide, but not the control RAD peptide, inhibited binding of CagL to AGS cells (Supplementary Fig. 9b, c). Fifth, invasion of *E. coli* HB101 *invA*⁺ into AGS cells, which requires integrin β₁ (ref. 6), was blocked by pre-infection of AGS cells with wild-type *H. pylori*, but not with the *cagL* deletion mutant (∆*cagL*) or the *cagL*(RGA) mutant (Supplementary Fig. 10). These various findings show conclusively that CagL uses its RGD motif to interact with the surface receptor integrin α₅β₁ on eukaryotic host cells, and support the hypothesis that CagL triggers type-IV secretion and phosphorylation of CagA through direct interaction with integrin α₅β₁.

**CagL activates FAK and Src tyrosine kinases**

Analyses of bound CagL-coated latex beads on integrin-β₁-positive cells at higher resolution showed that CagL beads triggered membrane ruffles on the host cell surface as well as intimate contact with the host cell membrane, whereas beads coated with the CagL(RGA) mutant exhibited only limited contact with the host surface (Fig. 4c, arrows). These observations support the view that CagL functions as a specialized adhesin that not only anchors the type-IV secretion apparatus to the host surface through binding to integrin, but also promotes signal transduction. These features of CagL complement the fundamental bacterial adherence functions of the two canonical *H. pylori* adhesins BabA and SabA¹⁷,¹⁸ during *H. pylori* infections. To understand further the downstream signalling of the CagL–integrin interaction, we examined the ability of CagL to trigger activation of FAK, as the latter is a key sensor of integrin engagement. On activation, FAK is autophosphorylated at tyrosine residue Y397, which then serves as a high-affinity binding site for the SH2 domain of Src, resulting in an active FAK–Src signalling complex². Our results show that both the infection of AGS cells with *H. pylori* expressing wild-type CagL and incubation of AGS cells with the RGD peptide led to transient activation of FAK and Src, as indicated by the accumulation of phosphorylated FAK-pY397 and Src-pY418, respectively (Fig. 5a, c and Supplementary Fig. 11a). The activation of FAK and

**Figure 6** | Three-step model for the activation of the *H. pylori* type-IV secretion system and phosphorylation of CagA through interaction of CagL with integrin. The illustrated type-IV secretion assembly mechanism is based on homology to the prototypical agrobacterial system, which is composed of 11 VirB proteins (B1–11) and the so-called coupling protein VirD4 (D4)⁸,⁹,¹², as indicated. The *H. pylori* type-IV secretion apparatus consists of up to 32 proteins including VirB/D homologues and proteins of as-yet-unknown functions such as CagL¹². In the absence of host contact, CagL is delivered to the bacterial surface or even specifically to the surface of the type-IV secretion pilus (steps 1–2). During infection, *H. pylori* establishes contact with the host cell. Surface-located CagL then binds to the transmembrane receptor integrin α₅β₁ (step 3). This interaction stimulates

Src coincided with the occurrence of CagA-pY in infected cells (Supplementary Fig. 11a), indicating that FAK activation and subsequently the activation of Src rapidly results in tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA. In contrast, activation of FAK and Src was seen neither with the *H. pylori* CagL(RGA) mutant nor the RAD peptide control (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 11b), indicating that the RGD motif of CagL has a crucial role in the activation of FAK and Src.

### Discussion

Taken together, we have shown that CagL is able to act bifunctionally to hijack host integrin receptors for injection of virulence factors into eukaryotic cells as well as to activate host tyrosine kinases. We propose that this elegant mechanism allows CagL to not only promote receptor-dependent translocation of CagA but also activate concomitantly the tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA at the site of injection (Fig. 6). Whether the CagL-mediated signalling might facilitate type-IV secretion by altering membrane dynamics is an intriguing proposition to be investigated further. Notably, the observation that both integrin β₁ function-blocking antibody and knockdown of integrin β₁ markedly reduced the number of elongated *H. pylori* pili (Supplementary Fig. 4e, f) suggests that interaction of integrin β₁ with CagL is important for the formation of visible type-IV secretion pili (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the CagL-derived RGD peptide only partially complemented the *H. pylori* *cagL*(RAD) mutant in the induction of type-IV secretion and phosphorylation of CagA, and failed to complement the Δ*cagL* deletion mutant in these functions (Fig. 3d), indicating that a direct contact between integrin α₅β₁ and CagL on *H. pylori* is likely to be essential for full type-IV secretion function, and that other amino acids apart from the RGD motif in CagL also have a function in activating type-IV secretion and phosphorylation of CagA.

We have demonstrated a previously unidentified role of integrin α₅β₁ in microbial pathogenesis, making integrin α₅β₁ the first human receptor shown to be exploited by a human bacterial pathogen for type-IV secretion of virulence factors into mammalian cells. Our findings support an intriguing mechanism by which the *H. pylori* type-IV secretion system, through activation of integrin α₅β₁ by the pilus-located adhesin and sensor molecule CagL, ensures phosphorylation of translocated CagA directly at the site of injection at focal adhesions and subsequently promotes downstream signalling in the host cell. Given that integrin α₅β₁ preferentially localizes to the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells, we propose that *H. pylori* disrupts cell–cell junctions and invades between cells to come into contact with integrins¹⁰,¹⁹. Although this study provides clear evidence that α₅β₁ integrin is a principal molecule in the interaction with CagL and type-IV secretion of CagA, the data presented do not preclude the possibility that other integrin receptors expressed on AGS cells might potentially also be involved in the binding of CagL to AGS cells. However, the notion that the type-IV secretion system functions through specific recognition of a host cell receptor adds a new dimension to our understanding of *H. pylori* pathogenesis, and opens up new opportunities for investigating type-IV-secretion-mediated protein translocation in general. The fact that CagL activates host tyrosine kinases and engages integrin α₅β₁ for triggering type-IV secretion provides new insights into the molecular basis of *H.-pylori*-induced malignancy. CagL might be a novel drug target for combating the severe gastric diseases caused by *cagPAI*-positive *H. pylori* strains.

# METHODS

Host cells, bacteria, infection and phosphorylation assays. The human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line AGS^{14,20}, the integrin β₁-deficient GD25 cells and GD25 cells re-expressing integrin β₁A (GD25β1A) have been described^{15}. AGS cells stably expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting integrin β₁ RNA (AGSΔβ₁ knockdown cells) or control cells expressing shRNA specific for firefly luciferase-GL2 RNA were generated by retroviral transduction. Knockdown of integrin β₁ was verified using standard flow cytometry (FACS-Calibur, BD Biosciences) and immunoblotting. *H. pylori* strains P1, P12 and their isogenic mutants P1 ΔcagL, P1 ΔflaA, P1 ΔvirB7, P1 ΔvirB10, P1 ΔvirB11, P1 ΔcagA/cagA(WT), P1 ΔcagA/cagA(Y972F) or P12 ΔcagPAI have been reported previously^{14,20}. Cloning, mutagenesis and genetic complementation of *cagL* was done using standard procedures^{14}. Cell monolayers were infected with *H. pylori* as described^{14,20}. The number of infected AGS cells exhibiting elongation phenotype was quantified in ten different 0.25-mm² fields. To determine the number of intracellular bacteria, gentamicin protection assays were performed^{20}. The number of intracellular bacteria (colony-forming units, c.f.u.) was obtained in three independent experiments. The preparation of membrane/nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of infected AGS cells has been described previously^{14}. *In vitro* phosphorylation assays with recombinant Src (Upstate) was performed as described previously^{21}.

Synthetic peptides, antibodies and western blotting. The cyclic peptides were synthesized as previously described^{22}. The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-*H. pylori* antibody (Biomeda); AIIB2 and BIIG2 specific for β₁ and α₅ integrin, respectively (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank); anti-integrin αᵥβ₃ (clone LM609, Chemicon); monoclonal anti-CagA antibody (Austral Biologicals); FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human integrin β₁, rabbit anti-human integrin β₁ antibody and monoclonal anti-vinculin (all from Santa Cruz). The mouse anti-CagL, rabbit anti-CagA and anti-urease antisera against the purified proteins were prepared by Biogenes. The rabbit anti-CagA-pY972 antibody was produced using a peptide-based antigen (H-VGLSASPEPIpYAT, Jerini). Western blotting was performed as described^{14,20}. To examine the type-IV secretion and phosphorylation of CagA during infections, total lysate of infected cells or the corresponding membrane and cytosol fractions were analysed by immunoblotting with anti-pY99 (Santa Cruz). Blots were probed sequentially with anti-CagA and anti-CagL antibodies to ensure equal amounts of bacteria in each lane. To rule out the possibility that the cytosolic fractions were contaminated with *H. pylori* proteins, all blots were probed with anti-urease^{14}. The presence of urease in the membrane fractions of infected AGS cells is due to attached *H. pylori*. Band intensities were quantified with the Lumi-Imager F1 (Roche Diagnostics). Images were processed for contrast and brightness using Adobe Photoshop (version 6.0).

Overexpression and purification of CagL proteins. To construct the vectors for overexpression of wild-type CagL or CagL(RGA) in *E. coli*, a DNA fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 21–237 of the protein (minus the predicted signal peptide) was amplified by PCR and ligated into pET-28a vector. CagL proteins were purified as follows: *E. coli* BL21(DE3) transformed with the corresponding overexpression plasmids were grown in LB medium at 37 °C for 2 h with shaking. Bacterial pellets were re-suspended in ice-cold buffer CW (50 mM KH₂PO₄-K₂HPO₄, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After sonication, the overexpressed CagL present in the inclusion bodies was solubilized in buffer LW (50 mM KH₂PO₄-K₂HPO₄, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride) and refolded in ice-cold refolding buffer (52 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 20 mM NaCl, 834 μM KCl, 1.1 mM EDTA, 2.1 mM reduced glutathione, 210 μM oxidized glutathione). After refolding, CagL was further purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography through Talon resin (BD Biosciences) and gel filtration in buffer CW through Sephacryl S-200 (16/60, Amersham Biosciences) to >95% homogeneity. The folded conformations of the purified CagL and CagL(RGA) were confirmed by circular dichroism^{23} using a J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Instruments).

Cell attachment assays and binding of ligand-coated latex beads. Cell attachment assays were performed according to procedures described previously^{24}. Latex beads (1.1 μm in diameter, Sigma) were coated with CagL or CagL(RGA) mutant protein as follows: the beads were incubated with protein ligand (1 mg ml⁻¹) in coupling buffer (50 mM MES pH 6.1, 200 mM NaCl) at 4 °C overnight. Beads were then washed with coupling buffer and nonspecific sites were blocked with 2% BSA for 1 h. AGS cell monolayer was co-incubated with protein-coated latex beads at an approximate cell:bead ratio of 1:100 for 3 h. After washing with RPMI, cells were fixed with 3.8% paraformaldehyde.

Binding of CagL to integrin α₅β₁ determined by surface plasmon resonance. Purified integrin α₅β₁ (Chemicon) was immobilized by amino coupling to the surface of a CM5 carboxymethyl dextran sensorchip. The analysis was performed as described previously^{22}. Data were processed using Biaevaluation software (version 4.1).

Immunofluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Immunofluorescence staining with different antibodies as shown in each experiment was performed as described^{14,20}. Samples were analysed using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope system equipped with a DM-IRE2 microscope and different lasers (Leica Microsystems). To avoid spectral overlap and channel crosstalk, FITC, TRITC, CY5 and Alexa-350 fluorophores were excited sequentially with argon-laser (488 nm), green helium (543 nm), red helium (633 nm) and ultraviolet laser (364 nm). DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining was used to visualize DNA.

Field and immunofield emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Procedures for the FESEM of *H. pylori* and *H.-pylori*-infected AGS cells were carried out as described previously^{16}. For immuno-FESEM of CagL, *H. pylori* samples were incubated with rabbit anti-CagL IgG antibodies (100 μg IgG protein per ml) followed by incubation with 15-nm protein-A-coated gold particles as described^{16}. *H.-pylori*-infected AGS samples on cover slips were incubated with rabbit anti-CagL IgG antibodies (100 μg IgG protein per ml) for 1 h at 30 °C, followed by washing in PBS and incubation with 15-nm protein-A-coated gold particles, or samples were incubated with mouse anti-CagA antibodies followed by 15-nm anti-mouse IgG-coated gold particles. All samples were coated with a thin carbon film.

Statistical analysis. All data were evaluated using the Student’s *t*-test with SigmaStat statistical software (version 2.0). Statistical significance was defined by *P* ≤ 0.01 (asterisk) and *P* ≤ 0.001 (double asterisk).
