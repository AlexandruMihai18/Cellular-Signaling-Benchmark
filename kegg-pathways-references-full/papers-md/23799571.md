Primary cilia and graded Sonic Hedgehog signaling

Noriaki Sasai and James Briscoe*

Cilia are evolutionary-conserved microtubule-containing organelles protruding from the surface of cells. They are classified into two types—primary and motile cilia. Primary cilia are nearly ubiquitous, at least in vertebrate cells, and it has become apparent that they play an essential role in the intracellular transduction of a range of stimuli. Most notable among these is Sonic Hedgehog. In this article we briefly summarize the structure and biogenesis of primary cilia. We discuss the evidence implicating cilia in the transduction of extrinsic signals. We focus on the involvement and molecular mechanism of cilia in signaling by Sonic Hedgehog in embryonic tissues, specifically the neural tube, and we discuss how cilia play an active role in the interpretation of gradients of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

INTRODUCTION

Cilia are evolutionary-conserved microtubule-based organelles that protrude from the surface of cells. Conventionally they have been classified into two types: primary cilia and motile, or specialized, cilia.¹⁻³ Within this second class are the cell-type and tissue-specific cilia that include the motile cilia of the node, which contribute to the laterality of an embryo, and the tufts of multiple cilia found on epithelial cells lining the airways, reproductive tracts, and cerebral ventricles. By contrast, primary cilia appear to be nearly ubiquitous with one cilium per cell, at least in vertebrates.⁴ Although considerable attention had been given to the function of motile cilia, the research spotlight has increasingly fallen on primary cilia. Over the last decade, it has become apparent that a series of human genetic disorders, collectively referred to as ciliopathies, are caused by mutations in proteins associated with primary cilia.⁵,⁶ A range of symptoms many of which can be traced to a developmental origin characterize these disorders. Alongside the studies of ciliopathies, genetic and cellular data from model vertebrates have revealed that primary cilia are essential for signal transduction by the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, and possibly other signaling pathways, both

during and after embryonic development. Together, this has led to the proposal that primary cilia act as essential cellular ‘antennae’ that transduce a range of stimuli intracellularly to control several developmental pathways.⁷

In this review, we briefly summarize the structure and biogenesis of primary cilia. We discuss the evidence implicating cilia in the transduction of extrinsic signals. We focus on the involvement and molecular mechanism of cilia in signaling by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) in embryonic tissues, specifically the neural tube, and we discuss how cilia play an active role in the interpretation of Shh signaling.

STRUCTURE AND BIOGENESIS OF PRIMARY CILIA

The basic structure of primary cilia is similar in all organisms, from single cell algae to metazoans. The hair-like shaft of the cilia extends from the apical membrane of most cells and comprises an axoneme of nine microtubule doublets organized in a peripheral ring surrounded by an extension of the plasma membrane¹,³ (Figure 1(a)). The ciliary shaft is sometimes located in a deep invagination known as the ciliary pocket.⁸⁻¹⁰ At the bottom of the cilia shaft is the basal body. Formed from the older ‘mother’ centriole of a cell, the basal body also consists of microtubules arranged in a cylindrical array and it

(a) Cross section of the axoneme of motile
and primary cilia. Primary cilia can be divided
into two groups—immotile primary cilia and
nodal cilia. Nodal cilia have axonemal dynein
arms. In all cases the diameter of the
axoneme is 200–250 nm. (b) The structure of
primary cilia. In the ciliary shaft, anterograde
transport depends on Kinesin-II motor
proteins—the heterotrimeric complex of
KIF3A, KIF3B, and the Kif-associated Protein
KAP3, or the homodimeric complex of
KIF17—and intraflagellar transport (IFT)-B
proteins. Retrograde transport depends on
the dynein proteins, dynic2h1 and dynic2l1
and IFT-A complex proteins. The transition
zone separates the axoneme and the basal
body from the rest of the cell and functions as
a diffusion barrier. In addition to several
proteins that localize to this area, the lipid
composition and the vesicles associated with
BBS proteins are involved in sorting the
proteins that enter the cilia. The basal body is
formed from the mother centriole, generated
in the previous cell cycle, and is connected to
the daughter centriole.3,12–15

acts as an organizing center to template the micro-
tubules that generate the ciliary shaft. The basal body
also anchors the ciliary shaft to the membrane of the
ciliary pocket, which itself appears to be the remnants
of the vesicle recruited to the nascent basal body dur-
ing the initiation of cilia formation. Besides this core
microtubule and membrane structure, upwards of a
thousand proteins have been found associated with
the cilia and basal body and these associated proteins
are implicated in the generation, maintenance, and
function of the cilia11 (www.ciliaproteome.org).

maintained. Moreover, cilia assembly is usually linked

quiescent (G0) or during late G1 and early S phases.¹⁶–¹⁸ As protein synthesis does not occur in cilia, the production and maintenance of cilia depend on shuttling proteins into and out of the cilia. This bidirectional movement of proteins along the microtubule axoneme of the cilium is called ‘intraflagellar transport’ (IFT) as it was originally discovered in the flagella, a structural analog of cilia, of the green alga Chlamydomonas.¹⁹ The heterotrimeric kinesin-2 motor is required for anterograde (base to tip) movement of ciliary proteins, whereas members of the cytoplasmic dynein family perform retrograde (tip to base) transportation.²⁰–²² These motor proteins are associated with a large set of IFT proteins that are divided into two complexes. The IFT-A complex appears to be primarily required for retrograde transport, conversely the IFT-B complex is implicated in anterograde movement (Figure 1(b)). Analysis of mouse mutants lacking IFT proteins indicates that these proteins are essential for the assembly and maintenance of the cilia structure as well as the transport of other proteins into and out of the cilia.²³–²⁵

Importantly, access to the cilium is strictly controlled. At the base of the ciliary shaft the membrane is tightly associated with axonemal microtubules emanating from the basal body.⁹,²⁶ In this ‘transition zone’ cytoplasmic proteins intended for the cilia are identified and selectively loaded onto the IFT transport system. Control of cilia protein composition also extends to the ciliary membrane. Membrane proteins are not free to diffuse from the plasma membrane through the ciliary pocket into cilia membrane. Members of the septin family have been implicated in controlling the passage of membrane proteins into and out of the ciliary shaft.²⁷ In addition, components of the basal body (e.g., Cep290)²⁸ and the lipid composition of the cilia pocket may also contribute to the diffusion barrier separating the cilium from adjacent membrane.²⁹–³¹ Proteins destined for the ciliary membrane appear to take one of several routes to enter the cilia. Vesicles containing cilia-targeted proteins that emanate from the Golgi, usually located just basal to the cilia, are transported to the cilia pocket and their contents deposited directly into the cilia membrane.³² Alternatively, membrane proteins residing in the plasma membrane can be gated through the diffusion barrier at the base of the cilia and moved laterally into the ciliary membrane.³³,³⁴

How proteins are identified for entry into the cilium remains poorly understood. One suggestion is that the mechanism resembles that used to control nuclear import. RAN, a small G-protein required for the translocation of RNA and proteins through nuclear pores, is present in the cilium and has been implicated in ciliary protein import.³⁵ In addition, the residues that comprise the targeting signals of several proteins located in cilia have been identified. At present no clear consensus motif has arisen from these studies, but one of the sequences that has been described bears a striking resemblance to a nuclear localization signal and is indeed sufficient to target proteins to the nucleus as well as the cilia.³⁵

The consequence of the mechanisms that control protein targeting and import to cilia is that the cilium is a discrete cell compartment with a protein content distinct from the adjacent cytoplasm. Thus, mechanisms that regulate the gating of proteins into and out of the cilium allow the composition of the cilium to be dynamically controlled. This property appears to have been exploited by several signal transduction pathways as a way to regulate protein and pathway activity (see below).

The position of ciliogenesis within some cells depends, at least in part, on the activity of the proteins that are also implicated in the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway.³⁶ In many cases, the PCP pathway is activated by Wnt ligands and involves several proteins including Frizzled (Fzd), Van Gogh (Vangl), Flamingo (Ceslr), and Dishevelled (Dvl), the latter of which localizes to basal bodies.³⁷ Analyses of several components of the PCP pathway have revealed their involvement in ciliogenesis.³⁶ For instance, loss of function of Fuzzy (Fuz), which encodes a putative trafficking protein,³⁸–⁴⁰ or the PDZ-domain containing protein Inturned⁴¹ (Intu) produce defects in ciliogenesis. However, whether the cilogenic and PCP functions of these proteins are directly linked or independent of one another remains unclear.

In addition to the posttranslational mechanisms that regulate ciliogenesis, the regulation of gene expression also contributes to cilia formation and the protein composition of cilia. The forkhead family member Foxj1 and several members of the RFX (regulatory factor X) family of transcription factors regulate the expression of genes that are specific to cilia. RFX proteins are necessary for the generation of both primary and motile cilia and a number of genes regulated by RFX family members, including genes involved in IFT, have been identified.⁴²,⁴³ By contrast, Foxj1 appears to be necessary and sufficient for the production of specialized motile cilia in vertebrates through the regulation of motile-cilia specific genes and the genes involved in apical localization of the basal body.⁴⁴–⁴⁶ The expression of Foxj1 induces several genes including dynein subunits that are specific to motile cilia.⁴⁶ fibroblast-growth factor (FGF) signaling which has been implicated in regulating the length of cilia has been suggested to function via the regulation

of Foxj1 and Rfx2 expression.⁴⁷ As well as these transcription factors, several additional transcription factors have been identified to function in ciliogenesis in specific cell types.⁴⁸ Thus, extrinsic signals and the transcription factors they regulate determine the constitution and type of cilia it generates.

### HEDGEHOG SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION

Interest in primary cilia was revitalized by the surprising finding that embryos harboring mutations in genes necessary for cilia formation were defective for Shh signaling.²³ This identified a central role for cilia in the transduction mechanism of Hh signals. Further studies implicated primary cilia in several additional signal transduction pathways, including the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), Notch and Wnt signaling pathways³⁶,⁴⁹ Below we focus our attention on Hh signaling and briefly summarize the current understanding of the involvement of cilia in other signaling pathways.

The proteins that comprise the core Hh signal transduction pathway were identified by genetic studies of Drosophila and vertebrates⁵⁰ (Figure 2). In amniotes there are three Hh proteins, Sonic (Shh), Indian (Ihh), and Desert (Dhh), and the initiation of intracellular signal transduction by these ligands depends on a transmembrane receptor. This consists of the 12-pass transmembrane receptor protein Patched (Ptc1) together with one of three co-receptors—Cdo, Boc, or Gas1.⁵¹⁻⁵⁵ In the absence of ligand, Ptc1 represses the activity of Smoothened (Smo), a 7 pass transmembrane protein with a structure reminiscent of G-protein-coupled receptors. The mechanism by

**FIGURE 2 |** The Hedgehog signaling pathway and cilia. In the absence of the Hedgehog ligand, the receptor protein Ptc is localized to cilia and inhibits another membrane protein Smo from residing in the cilia. Full-length Gli2 and Gli3 proteins (yellow GliFL) bind to SuFu and KIF7. GliFL proteins transit through the cilia. This results in GliFL acquiring an as yet to be determined mark (green GliFL). The marked GliFL is phosphorylated by PKA-CK1-GSK3β (orange GliFL) probably at the base of the cilia and GliFL is processed, by β-TrCP and Cul3, to form the truncated repressor form of Gli (red GliRep). GliRep dissociates from SuFu and enters the nucleus to repress target genes. In the presence of Hedgehog, Ptc leaves cilia, which allows the activation of Smo. Two kinases GRK2 and β-Arr2 phosphorylate the carboxy-terminal serine residues of Smo facilitating the activation of Smo. Activated Smo enters and resides in the ciliary membrane. The complex of GliFL and SuFu dissociates in the cilia, and the free GliFL, now in its activator form (GliAct) translocates into the nucleus. GliAct is phosphorylated and the degradation of GliFL and GliAct is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase SPOP.
which Ptc1 inhibits Smo remains unclear although several studies suggest that lipid intermediaries that act as agonists or antagonists of Smo might be involved.⁵⁶ Irrespective of the exact mechanism, the binding of Hh protein to Ptc1 facilitates the activation of Smo. This depends, at least in part, on the phosphorylation of specific residues in the carboxy-tail of Smo and a conformational change that alters intramolecular interactions.⁵⁷,⁵⁸ How Smo then transmits the signal intracellularly is poorly understood. Ultimately, however, the transduction pathway regulates the activities of three zinc-finger-containing transcription factors of the Gli family, Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3.⁵⁹

In vertebrates, the principal transcriptional mediators of the Hh response are Gli2 and Gli3, which act as bifunctional transcription factors.⁶⁰ In the absence of Shh, Gli2 and Gli3 are proteolytically processed into repressor forms by the removal of their carboxy-terminal trans-activation domains.⁶¹,⁶² This processing step relies on phosphorylation of a region of the Gli proteins by the kinases PKA, GSK3β, and CK1 that in turn leads to the recruitment of β-TrCP, ubiquitination, and then the partial proteolysis of the protein via the proteosome.⁶¹,⁶³–⁶⁶ The activation of Smo inhibits Gli protein processing and results in the accumulation of the full-length proteins containing the transactivator domain. Inhibition of the proteolytic processing is not in itself sufficient for the activation of Gli proteins. An additional step involves regulation by suppressor of fused (Sufu). This cytoplasmic PEST-domain containing protein binds to full-length Gli2 and Gli3 but not to their proteolytically processed forms.⁶⁷–⁶⁹ Gli proteins bound to SuFu are unable to translocate to the nucleus so can not activate gene expression. Activation of the signaling pathway facilitates the dissociation of full-length Gli proteins from Sufu.⁶⁹ What triggers this dissociation is not clear but might involve phosphorylation⁷⁰ or other posttranslation modifications of the Gli proteins. Once dissociated Gli proteins can enter the nucleus and transactivate target genes. At the same time, however, loss of SuFu binding results in a marked increase in the rate of Gli protein degradation⁶⁹; binding to the MATH-BTB-domain-containing E3-ubiquitin ligase SPOP is implicated in this increased turnover. Therefore, the balance between Gli-SuFu and Gli-SPOP formation appears to be important to regulate the amount and activity of Gli proteins⁷¹ (Figure 2).

pathway in the cilium and the requirement for cilia in order for cells to evince a Hh response.²² In Table 1 we summarize the function and localization of proteins associated with cilia that are implicated in Hh signaling.

The first evidence that vertebrate Hh signaling relies on cilia emerged from a genetic screen of mouse embryogenesis that identified a series of mutants with phenotypes redolent of dysregulated Hh signaling.¹²⁷ The genes disrupted in these mutants encode several members of the IFT-B complex including IFT172 and IFT88 for anterograde motor, and Dyn2H1, a component of the retrograde motor (Figure 3). Consistent with these data, a similar phenotype is also apparent in mice with a mutation in Kif3a, the kinesin-2 anterograde motor.²³ The mutations analyzed in these initial studies resulted either in the absence of primary cilia, or structural defects in the primary cilia, and produced abnormalities characteristic of reduced Hh signaling. Moreover the disruption to Hh signaling was not restricted to specific tissues or cell types. Indeed, in every instance where it has been investigated, defects in primary ciliogenesis are tightly linked to abnormal Hh signaling. Examples of this include embryonic patterning of the neural tube and the limb by Shh signaling, chondrocyte differentiation regulated by Ihh, and the Shh-dependent proliferation of adult neural stem cells.⁸⁹,⁹⁰,¹¹⁰,¹²⁸ Furthermore, the requirement for primary cilia for Hh signaling extends to non-mammalian vertebrates. Zebrafish that lack both maternal and zygotic Ift88 display defects in Hh signaling in the neural tube and somites¹²⁹ and an embryonically lethal line of chicken mutants that are unable to generate cilia have Hh signaling defects.¹³⁰

Following the initial demonstration of a requirement for cilia for Shh signaling, further cilia-associated proteins have been implicated in Hh signaling. These include additional members of the IFT complexes,²⁴,⁹⁰,⁹³–⁹⁵,¹³¹ as well as proteins such as the small G-protein Arl13b that are located in the cilia shaft and implicated in maintaining the microtubule structure.⁹⁹ The analysis of a variety of mutants that display dysregulated Hh signaling indicate that both the complete absence of cilia and morphologically abnormal cilia affect Shh signaling. For example, mutations in the protein Bromi result in deformed bulbous cilia and abnormal Shh signaling.¹¹⁸ In addition, mutations in components of the basal body that disrupt ciliogenesis also result in dysregulated Hh signaling. Essential basal body proteins include Talpid3, OFD1, MKS1, FTM/RPGRIP1L, mutations in these have abnormal or absent cilia and exhibit various degrees of disruption to Hh signaling (Table 1). In addition, another basal body protein, Evc, is mutated

FIGURE 3 | Classification of the neural tube phenotype in mutant mice lacking Shh-related ciliary factors. The left panel illustrates the dorsal–ventral pattern of a cross section of the neural tube. Each of the interneuron subtypes (v0–v3) and motor neurons (MNs) differentiate from their adjacent progenitor domains (p0–p3, pMN), located at a characteristic dorsal–ventral position. Each progenitor domain is defined by the combination of transcription factors it expresses and is established by a gradient of Shh emanating from the ventrally located floor plate and notochord. The right panels categorize the patterning defects observed in the neural tube and indicate the mutated genes that produce these phenotypes. In Categories I and II defects the generation of ventral identities is lost or decreased; these phenotypes suggest the reduction of Shh signaling activity. Conversely, Categories III and IV defects display phenotypes in which ventral identities are expanded dorsally. This is due to increased Gli<sup>Act</sup> and to a loss of negative regulation of Shh signaling leading to decreased Gli<sup>Rep</sup>. Slanted blocks represent a mixture of cell identities. Underneath each diagram are lists of the mutants that fall into these categories. pDI; dorsal interneuron progenitors, RP; roof plate, FP; floor plate.

in the human skeletal disorder Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Its expression is limited to developing skeletal structures, and the absence of Evc leads to reduced Ihh signaling specifically within skeletal structures.<sup>110</sup>

The second line of evidence that pointed to the role of cilia in vertebrate Hh signaling was the observation that many of the core components of the Hh pathway are enriched in cilia. In unstimulated cells, Ptch1 is detected in the shaft of cilia<sup>132</sup> and PKA is concentrated around the basal body.<sup>78</sup> By contrast, Smo is absent in cilia. Following exposure to Hh protein, however, Ptch1 rapidly disappears from cilia and Smo accumulates in the shaft.<sup>132</sup> Pulse-labeling studies indicate that the ciliary Smo originates initially from a pool in the plasma membrane, although the way Smo is gated into the cilium in response to ligand is unclear.<sup>133,134</sup> In addition, the levels of Gli2 and Gli3, which are either low or undetectable in cilia in the absence of Shh signaling, are increased in cilia within minutes of Hh stimulation<sup>77,135,136</sup> and become enriched at the distal tip of the cilium. At the same time, SuFu is observed at cilia tips and this appears to be a consequence of the direct interaction between SuFu and Gli proteins as SuFu is not found in the cilia in the absence of Gli2 and Gli3.<sup>77</sup>

A kinesin family member, Kif7, is the best candidate for trafficking Gli proteins in cilia. Kif7 is the vertebrate ortholog of the Drosophila gene Cos2 that was originally identified as a core component of the Hh signaling pathway.<sup>137,138</sup> In the absence of ligand, Kif7 localizes to the base of primary cilia but in response to pathway activation it is also observed at the tip of the cilium. Kif7 physically interacts with Gli2 and Gli3 and is necessary for the localization of Gli3 to cilia in response to Hh.<sup>86,87</sup> The translocation of Kif7 depends on its motor domain, suggesting that it acts as an anterograde motor in the cilium.<sup>88</sup> In embryos lacking Kif7, Hh signaling is aberrant and Gli2 and Gli3 are not enriched in cilia.<sup>86–88,139</sup> Together, these data lead to the idea that Kif7 is responsible for the presence of Gli proteins at cilia tips in cells responding to Hh, although how Hh signaling regulates this trafficking remains to be determined.

CILIA-DEPENDENT HEDGEHOG SIGNALING IN THE NEURAL TUBE

The analysis of the phenotypes of the mutants that lack different components of primary cilia has revealed further complexities in the role for cilia in Shh signaling. This has led to the realization that cilia are not only required for the activation of the signaling pathway in response to ligand but also involved in the ligand-independent activity of the pathway. The best evidence for this has come from the analysis of Hh signaling during neural tube development.

In the developing spinal cord, the precise spatial location in which distinct neuronal subtypes are generated depends on Shh signaling.¹⁴⁰ Shh protein is produced from the ventral pole of the neural tube and forms a ventral-to-dorsal concentration gradient in neural tissue¹⁴¹ that establishes differential spatial patterns of gene expression in neural progenitors (Figure 3). The set of differentially regulated genes comprises several transcription factors the expression of which divide the neural tube into molecularly distinct progenitor domains arrayed along the dorsal ventral axis. Importantly, for the analysis of the role of cilia in Shh signaling the patterns of transcription factor expression can be used as a reliable measure of the level of Shh signal transduction (Figure 3). For example, high levels of Shh signaling induce the expression of the homeodomain protein Nkx2.2, consequently Nkx2.2 expression is restricted to the most ventrally located progenitors. By contrast, lower levels of signaling are sufficient to induce the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Olig2, resulting in an expression domain of Olig2 dorsal to Nkx2.2 expressing progenitors. Yet lower levels of Shh signaling repress the paired homeodomain protein Pax7 and its expression is thereby restricted to progenitors in the dorsal half of the neural tube.¹⁴²–¹⁴⁴

As a result of the dual activator and repressor activities of the Gli proteins several distinct defects in neural tube patterning are observed when different components of the pathway are disrupted. These defects can be categorized into four classes on the basis of the pattern of gene expression in neural progenitors (Figure 3). The severest phenotypes (Categories I and IV) arise when mutations result in repression of the pathway even in the presence of ligand or ligand-independent maximum activation of the pathway. For example, in the absence of Smo (or Shh), it is impossible to activate the pathway and Gli proteins are constitutively processed into their repressor forms.⁸⁰,⁸³,⁸⁹,¹⁴⁵ Consequently, none of the ventral markers of neural tube development are expressed and Pax7 expands to occupy ventral territories. We classify these defects as Category I. Conversely, in the absence of Ptch1 the signal transduction pathway is activated irrespective of the presence of the ligand; thus, Gli proteins are fully active and ventral markers are induced throughout the neural tube⁷¹,⁸² (Category IV defects). A similar ligand-independent activation of the pathway is also observed in SuFu mutants, although, in this case, the level of ectopic signaling appears somewhat lower than in Ptch1 mutants.⁷⁴ The most likely explanation for this is that, compared to mutations in Ptch1, the absence of SuFu results in the rapid degradation of the activated Gli proteins and high levels of signaling are therefore sustained for a shorter period of time.⁶⁹,⁷⁴

Compared to the patterning defects that result from losing either the positive or negative arm of the pathway, intermediate neural tube patterning defects are seen in embryos that lack both repressor and activator forms of Gli proteins. For example, in embryos that lack Gli2 and Gli3, both positive and negative transcriptional activities are lost.⁵⁹ These Category II patterning defects result in the absence of genes that rely on the highest level of Gli acitivity, such as Nkx2.2; however, lower response genes that principally depend on the absence of repressor Gli activity, e.g., Olig2, are still induced and Pax7 expression does not expand into the ventral neural tube.

Category II neural tube patterning defects are observed in many of the mutants in which ciliogenesis is blocked. Thus, in embryos that lack components of the anterograde IFT-B complex, including Kif3a, Ift172, and Ift88, or lack proteins of the basal body, such as Talpid3 and Ftm, the induction of the highest Shh response genes is defective, but the induction of Olig2 and the repression of Pax7 are maintained.²³,⁴³,⁸⁴,¹⁰⁷,¹³⁰ The similarity in neural tube patterning between embryos that lack cilia and those that have lost both positive and negative Gli activities suggests that a primary cilium is required not only for the activation of Gli proteins but also for their proteolytic processing to repressors. Accordingly, in addition to a requirement for cilia for the intracellular transduction of a ligand-dependent signal, cilia are also required for the generation of Gli repressor activity in the absence of signaling.²¹,⁸⁹ In line with these genetic data, Gli proteins and Smo have been shown to constitutively traffic through the cilia irrespective of whether the cells are exposed to Shh ligand.¹³⁵ Thus, there appears to be continuous flux of Smo and Gli proteins through the cilia even though these proteins are not detectable in cilia in the absence of Shh signaling. The finding that PKA, which is required for the phosphorylation of Gli proteins prior to their proteolysis, is associated with
the basal body leads to the idea that in the absence of signaling Gli proteins are transported through the cilia to be proteolytically processed into transcriptional repressors on their return to ciliary base. ${ }^{78}$

Crucially, not all mutations that affect primary cilia result in the same Shh signaling defects. Mutations that result in the production of primary cilia with abnormal morphologies frequently have neural tube patterning defects suggestive of partial activation of the Shh signaling pathway. We term these Category III defects. For instance, the hennin mutant, which is caused by a frameshift in the small, cilia localized GTPase Arl13b, produce deformed cilia that are approximately half the length of normal cilia. In these embryos, although neural tube genes characteristic of the highest levels of Shh signaling fail to be induced, there is a dorsal expansion of genes that require low levels of Shh signaling. ${ }^{99}$ This suggests that a constitutive low level of positive Gli activity is produced in Arl13b mutants even in the absence of Shh ligand. Because the highest responses appear to be blunted in Arl13b mutants we designate this pattern as Category III-a. Ectopic, ligand-independent Shh signaling is also observed in embryos lacking Rab23, a small GTPase that might be involved in the transport of vesicles containing Smo to or from the cilium. ${ }^{121,122,146}$ In this case, the genes that require the highest level of Shh signaling are also ectopically induced although the extent of expansion of these genes is less than observed in Category IV defects. The absence of THM1 (also known as IFT139) and IFT122, components of IFT-A complex involved in retrograde ciliary transport, produces cilia with short bulbous shafts. ${ }^{24,95}$ Similar to the absence of Rab23 these mutants result in ligand-independent activity of the Shh pathway and Category III patterning defects. Analysis of compound mutants in which IFT122 and core components of the Shh signaling pathway are mutated indicates that IFT122 is required for the Shh pathway activity at a step downstream of Smo, but upstream of Gli2.

Strikingly, the Shh signaling defects in THM1 and IFT122 mutants cannot be explained simply by perturbation of retrograde transport. Disruption of Dynic2h1, the motor protein required for retrograde transport, produces cilia that are morphologically similar to those found in THM1 and IFT122 mutants, ${ }^{24,95,147}$ but embryos lacking Dynic2H1 display a loss of Shh signaling consistent with a Category II defect. This is despite the accumulation of Smo and Gli2 in the cilia of Dynic2H1 mutants. ${ }^{147}$ Moreover, reducing the dosage of IFT122 (IFT-A) or IFT172 (IFT-B) in Dynic2H1 rescues the cilia morphology defects and partially restores the sensitivity of neural progenitors to Shh signaling. ${ }^{147}$

The limbs of embryos with cilia defects also have patterning defects consistent with disruption to graded Shh signaling. In this tissue, however, it is more difficult to classify the patterning defects and therefore to correlate the defects with changes in the level Shh signaling. For instance, mutants for Dnchc2, IFT172, IFT88, Talpid, C2cd3, and Tectonic2 (Tctn2), which have Category II defects in the neural tube, and mutations in Gli3, Tulp3, Fuz, and Inturned, that produce Category III defects, all result in polydactyly—the formation of extra digits (see Table 1 for references). One possibility is that there are differences between the limb and neural tube in the involvement of specific cilia-associated proteins in the positive and negative arms of the Shh signaling pathway. Alternatively, the polydactyly observed in the different mutants might be qualitatively different: for example, the polydactyly in Category II mutants could result from the duplication of anterior digits (digits 1 and 2), whereas posterior digits (digits 3–5) are duplicated in Category III mutants.

Taken together, therefore, these studies indicate that intact cilia are required to prevent the activation of Gli proteins and suggest an active molecular mechanism involving cilia components that are required for Gli repressor generation. A clue to this mechanism comes from the requirement for Tulp3 for Shh signaling. This protein binds to the IFT-A complex and localizes to the ciliary base and in punctuate spots along the ciliary shaft including the tip of the cilia. ${ }^{96-98}$ Mutations in Tulp3 result in ectopic Shh signaling and Category III defects, similar to the defects caused by the loss of IFT122. Strikingly, the localization of Tulp3 to cilia tips is disrupted in IFT122 mutants but not in Dynic2h1 mutants. ${ }^{95}$ Thus, one function of IFT-A complex proteins might be to ensure the structure integrity of the cilium and to ensure the appropriate localization of Tulp3 in cilia. This localization of Tulp3 is, in turn, required for the formation of repressor Gli proteins and the proper regulation of Gli activity.

In contrast to the mutants described above, loss of another protein involved in ciliogenesis, Bromi, results in embryos that are unable to generate the highest Shh responses but retain a normal response to lower level signaling. ${ }^{118}$ In these embryos the cilia have a distinctive bulbous morphology, somewhat similar to THM1 and IFT122 mutants, but in the case of Bromi mutants the morphological abnormality is due to defects in the association of the ciliary axoneme with the surrounding membrane. The neural tube patterning defects in these mutants resemble a Category II defect and are similar to those observed in embryos harboring hypomorphic alleles of C2cd3 or IFT88
function.²³,¹⁰⁵ This supports the view that the precise balance of activator and repressor Gli proteins produced by exposure to ligand depends on the structural integrity of cilia and the proper functioning of ciliary transport.

# A MOLECULAR MODEL FOR CILIA-DEPENDENT SHH SIGNALING

Collectively, these data indicate the essential role cilia have in the interpretation of graded Shh signaling and shed light on the complexity of the relationship between cilia and Shh signaling. Nevertheless, important questions remain unanswered. First, there appear to be differences along the rostral-caudal axis of the neural tube in the phenotypes of some of the mutants described.⁸⁹,⁹⁴ The reasons for this are not clear, but might be because of differences in the requirement for the positive and negative arms of the signaling pathway at different rostral-caudal positions of the neural tube.¹⁴⁸ Second, the full extent of the involvement of cilia-associated proteins and processes in the interpretation of Shh signaling remains to be defined. One example of this is the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) family of proteins. These proteins form a complex that is involved in the delivery of cilia-membrane-targeted proteins to the cilia.³² Polydactyly is observed in humans carrying mutations in BBS proteins, which would be consistent with dysregulated Hh signaling.¹⁴⁹ Moreover, Shh signaling defects have been reported in animal models lacking BBS proteins.¹⁵⁰ However, a detailed understanding of how this set of proteins affects Shh signaling remains to be determined. Another open issue is whether specialized cilia, such as motile cilia, are equally competent to transduce a Shh signal. In this respect it is notable that Foxj1, a transcription factor that is necessary for motile ciliogenesis, appears to alter the Shh response of neural cells.¹⁵¹ Expression of Foxj1 in the neural tube is sufficient to induce the conversion of primary cilia into much longer cilia reminiscent of motile cilia.⁴⁶,¹⁵¹,¹⁵² This is accompanied by a decrease in the response of cells to Shh signaling, suggesting that the structural changes induced by Foxj1 in cilia modify the transduction of the Shh signal.¹⁵¹ What mediates this change in sensitivity and whether this is also true in other cells expressing Foxj1 remain to be seen.

Despite the unanswered questions, a tentative picture is beginning to form that describes the molecular mechanism of Shh signaling in the cilia. In unstimulated cells, Ptch1 is detected in cilia and full-length Gli2 and -Gli3 proteins are complexed with SuFu.⁶⁹,¹³²,¹⁵³ The combination of Ptch1 and SuFu inhibits pathway activation and are necessary for the proteolytic processing of Gli proteins into their transcriptional repressor forms. Although Smo, Gli2, and Gli3 are not detected in cilia in the absence of ligand, they transit through it. This cilia flux appears to be required for the processing of Gli2 and Gli3 since defects in cilia structure disrupt proteolytic processing. Why transit through the cilia is required remains to be determined; however, both Kif7 and Sufu are required for the normal processing of Gli proteins.⁶⁹,¹⁵⁴ Moreover, the involvement of the ciliary located Tulp3 in proteolytic processing suggests the possibility that Kif7 brings Gli proteins complexed with Sufu into the cilia where they are marked for processing. The nature of this mark is unclear, but the end result is that proteolytic processing proceeds via PKA phosphorylation as the Gli proteins return to the base of the cilia. The processed Gli repressor proteins dissociate from SuFu and this enables their entry into the nucleus where they repress transcriptional targets.

Upon Hh pathway activation the composition of the cilia changes. Ptch1 disappears from cilia and in its place Smo moves into the cilia from the adjacent membrane. What molecular mechanisms responsible for the removal of Ptch1 and the accumulation of Smo are not known. The accumulation of Smo in cilia is not, in itself, sufficient for activation of the pathway because a small molecule antagonist of Smo promotes cilia localization of Smo but not its activation.¹⁵⁵ Changes in both the phosphorylation and conformation of Smo are associated with the activation of signaling,⁵⁸ indicating that the regulation of Smo activity might involve several distinct steps. In response to these changes in Smo, Gli2, and Gli3 together with SuFu, become enriched at the tip of the cilium, suggesting that pathway activation results in a longer residence time for Smo, Gli, and SuFu proteins in the cilia. The enrichment in cilia depends on Kif7 and results in the activation of the Gli proteins instead of their partial degradation.⁸⁶ The nature of this activation step is unclear, but several posttranslation modifications have been suggested to affect Gli activity including phosphorylation, acetylation, and SUMOylation.⁶⁹,¹³⁶,¹⁵⁶,¹⁵⁷ The end result is the dissociation of the Gli-Sufu complex and the transport of the newly liberated full-length Gli protein from the cilia to the nucleus where it can replace the Gli repressors to activate transcription. The way in which Gli proteins are transported from cilia to the nucleus also remains to be determined, but an interesting possibility arising from the observation that the cilia targeting of Kif17 involves some of the same components used for nuclear localization³⁵ is that the cilia and nuclear targeting of Gli proteins use interrelated mechanisms.

CILIA AND OTHER SIGNALING PATHWAYS

Cilia have been implicated in the transduction of several additional extrinsic signals and although the data is not as strong as that for Hh signaling, it is increasingly clear that the function of primary cilia is not restricted to Hh signaling. One example is platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling.⁴⁹,¹⁵⁸,¹⁵⁹ The receptor for PDGF-AA, PDGFRα, localizes to cilia and cilia are required for PDGF-AA-dependent chemotatic-directed migration of fibroblasts. In response to PDGF-AA, Akt and MEK-ERK kinases are activated with MEK1/2 being phosphorylated at the base of the primary cilium in wild-type fibroblasts but not in fibroblasts unable to make cilia.⁴⁹,¹⁵⁸ Because PDGFR signaling is not required during the early stages of embryogenesis genetic support for the involvement of cilia in PDGF signaling has yet to be forthcoming. But PDGF is necessary for the development of specific cell types at later developmental stages¹⁶⁰ and it will be interesting to determine whether embryos with defective ciliogenesis have phenotypes consistent with the loss of PDGF signaling at these later stages.

Cilia have also been suggested to be involved in Wnt signaling. An increase in Wnt activity assayed by reporters of canonical Wnt signaling, which measure the activity of β-catenin-dependent transcription, has been found in cell lines and embryos with cilia defects.⁸⁴ This suggests that cilia negatively regulate the canonical pathway of Wnt signaling. Moreover, a recent study provides evidence that this activity depends on the sequestration of a transcriptional cofactor of Wnt signaling within cilia.¹⁶¹ However, these conclusions are contentious because mouse mutants that lack cilia do not show gastrulation or early patterning phenotypes that would be characteristic of increased Wnt signaling. Moreover, embryos that lack either of IFT88, IFT172 or Dyn2h1 do not display alterations in Wnt transcriptional responses.¹⁴⁷ Likewise, Wnt signaling is intact in zebrafish in which the cilia structure is depleted by the removal of IFT88.¹²⁹ Perhaps the sensitivity of the assays or cell-type-specific effects can account for the inconsistencies between these data.

In addition to these signals, Notch signaling also appears to require intact cilia, at least in epidermal cells.¹⁶² Presenilin-2 and Notch3, components of the Notch pathway, are enriched in the basal body and ciliary shaft. Moreover, blockade of ciliogenesis by the knockdown of IFT proteins or conditional ablation of *Ift-88* and *Kif3a* in keratinocytes resulted in a cell autonomous loss of Notch signaling.¹⁶² Similarly, the enrichment of various other receptors in the ciliary membrane in specific cell types including mechanosensory proteins such as the polycystic kidney disease proteins 1 and 2 (PKD1 and 2) and G-protein-coupled receptors has suggested a broader role for cilia in signal reception.¹⁶³–¹⁶⁶

PERSPECTIVE

Taken together, a picture emerges in which primary cilia have an active role in the reception and transmission of Shh signaling and possibly other signaling pathways too. Details of the molecular mechanisms involved remain to be fleshed out; however, it is tempting to speculate that the unique structure of a cilium and its membrane have facilitated the elaboration of signaling mechanisms for specific reasons. One possible merit for the use of cilia by signal transduction pathways is that it results in the concentration of all the signaling mediators in a defined subcellular space. This could afford cells greater accuracy and the ability to fine-tune their response to signals. It is notable that both Shh signaling in neural tube patterning and PDGF-mediated and directed cell movement depend on cells accurately interpreting different concentrations of an extrinsic signal. In this respect, it will be interesting to compare signaling between vertebrate and invertebrate cells. Unlike vertebrates, most Drosophila cells lack cilia. Thus, understanding the features of Drosophila Hh signal transduction that differs from its vertebrate counterpart may provide insight into the unique properties of cilia-mediated signal transduction. More practically, further elucidating the mechanisms of signal transduction that involve cilia will shed light on these pathways and the ways cells use to interpret them. It will be fascinating to determine whether other signaling pathways also exploit cilia for similar purposes and how these mechanisms evolved.
