Summary: Lymphotoxins (LTα and LTβ), LIGHT [homologous to LT, inducible expression], competes with herpes simplex virus (HSV) glycoprotein D for HSV entry mediator (HVEM), a receptor expressed on T lymphocytes], tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and their specific receptors LTβR, HVEM, and TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNFR2, form the immediate family of the larger TNF superfamily. These cytokines establish a critical communication system required for the development of secondary lymphoid tissues; however, knowledge of the target genes activated by these signaling pathways is limited. Target genes regulated by the LTαβ-LTβR pathway include the tissue-organizing chemokines, CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21, which establish cytokine circuits that regulate LT expression on lymphocytes, leading to organized lymphoid tissue. Infectious disease models have revealed that LTαβ pathways are also important for innate and adaptive immune responses involved in host defense. Here, regulation of interferon-β by LTβR and TNFR signaling may play a crucial role in certain viral infections. Regulation of autoimmune regulator in the thymus via LTβR implicates LT/LIGHT involvement in central tolerance. Dysregulated expression of LIGHT overrides peripheral tolerance leading to T-cell-driven autoimmune disease. Blockade of TNF/LT/LIGHT pathways as an intervention in controlling autoimmune diseases is attractive, but such therapy may have risks. Thus, identifying and understanding the target genes may offer an opportunity to fine-tune inhibitory interventions.

Introduction  
The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related cytokines provide essential communication pathways that help orchestrate inflammatory and immune responses. Acting through specific cellular receptors, these cytokines initiate signaling pathways that affect cell death, survival, and differentiation. Each ligand-receptor pair constitutes a signaling system, with over 20 distinct systems now recognized in the superfamily, that regulates developmental and physiological processes in bone, neuronal, and ectodermal organs as well as the immune system (1–3). The TNF superfamily of ligands (TNFSF) share a common structure as type II transmembrane proteins that

assemble as compact trimers, biologically active as membrane bound or soluble proteins. Members of the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) are type I transmembrane glycoproteins defined by a cysteine-rich (CR) motif in the ligand-binding ectodomain. Some receptors lack signaling domains or are secreted, serving as decoys or soluble regulators. TNF and lymphotoxin (LT), the prototypic members of the super- family, represent a microcosm of the larger family in their shared structural and functional properties, yet each system contributes unique functions, demonstrating the highly integrated nature of these signaling pathways.

A voluminous literature documents the important roles of TNF in initiating inflammatory and immune responses. The LT-related cytokines have emerged most clearly in the development and organization of secondary lymphoid structures, an aspect reviewed recently (4). LIGHT [homologous to LT, inducible expression, competes with herpes simplex virus (HSV) glycoprotein D for HSV entry mediator (HVEM), a receptor expressed on T lymphocytes] has a limited role in development but appears to function in T-cell responses. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the LTαβ and LIGHT systems play important roles in regulating gene expression crucial for innate and adaptive defenses to pathogens, and they may contribute to mechanisms of immune tolerance necessary to control autoimmune diseases (5, 6). Here, we review the recent results linking the signaling pathways initiated by the LTαβ and LIGHT systems, their target genes where known, and the phenotypes observed in models of infection and autoimmune disease.

The immediate family Four closely related ligands define the immediate TNF family, which include LTα, LTβ, TNF, and LIGHT (TNFSF14), and their four cognate receptors, TNFR1, TNFR2, LTβR, and HVEM (Fig. 1). The overlapping patterns of ligand-receptor binding are a major feature of the immediate family. LTα and LTβ form three distinct ligands, a secreted homotrimer of LTα (LTα3), and two membrane-anchored heterotrimers, LTα1β2 (predominant form) and LTα2β1, with the LTβ subunit providing the membrane anchor. LTα3, like TNF, binds two receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. By contrast, LTα1β2 signals via the LTβR. LTα2β1 binds TNFR1 and TNFR2, but it is a minor form without a clear biological role. LIGHT, the most recently described member of the immediate family, represents a second ligand for the LTβR (7–9), but also interacts with HVEM (10). HVEM may also serve as a third receptor for LTα (7). DcR3 is a soluble receptor for LIGHT, Fas ligand, and

TL1A (11), demonstrating a broader functionally conserved relationship among these ligands, which is also reflected in their conserved gene structure and chromosomal position (12, 13).

Although the shared utilization of ligands and receptors in the immediate family suggests functional redundancy, gene deletion studies in mice have revealed unique and cooperating roles for each ligand-receptor pair in the development and function of the immune system, indicating the highly integrated nature of the physiologic activities of these signaling pathways. Temporal expression of ligands and receptors during development and homeostasis also contributes to specificity as does the spatial location of the ligands, either as membrane-anchored molecules, which necessitates cell contact for signaling, or as secreted proteins acting at distant tissues. Regulatory mechanisms affecting transcriptional induction and stability and restricted cellular patterns of expression, among other mechanisms, also contribute to signaling specificity as well as activation of distinct signaling pathways (6). Factors known to be important for the regulated expression of LT are summarized in Table 1.

Signaling Recent attention has focused on the finding that distinct forms of the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) family of transcription factors are activated by TNF-TNFR1 and LTαβ-LTβR systems. The NFκB family of transcription factors regulate hundreds of genes crucial to the development of cells and organs of the innate and adaptive immune responses (14–17). The NFκB family is composed of five members: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NFκB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NFκB2 (p52 and its precursor p100). These proteins form a collection of homo- dimer and heterodimers that can function as transcriptional activators or inhibitors. Activation of NFκB can be initiated by a wide variety of stimuli, including many cytokine systems. NFκB1/RelA is largely associated with activation by inflammatory stimuli. NFκB1 is held in a latent form in the cytosol by the inhibitors of κB (IκB), which masks a nuclear localization signal. The phosphorylation of the IκB by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex results in ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome allowing the NFκB1/RelA dimer to translocate into the nucleus. The IKK complex is composed of two catalytic subunits (IKKα and IKKβ) and a regulatory subunit (IKKγ, also called NEMO) and is the point of convergence of varied stimuli. TNF and LTβR ligation result in the activation of genes involved in proinflammatory reactions, including chemokines, such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1β

Fig. 1. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) core family and signaling pathways. The interactions of TNF cytokines with their cognate receptor(s) are shown by arrows. Binding of ligand to receptor leads to the induction of downstream signaling cascades. The presence of a DD in the intracellular portion of the receptor (depicted in yellow) results in the recruitment of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)-associated death domain (TRADD) and the ultimate induction of apoptosis. In the absence of a DD, TNFRs interact directly with TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) molecules to induce signaling via the classical nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway, resulting in the translocation of NFκB heterodimers (i.e. p50/RelA) to the nucleus to induce effector genes. The LTβR also induces a nonclassical NFκB pathway involving the processing of p100 and the translocation of p52/RelB to the nucleus.

(MIP-1β) and MIP-2, as well as integrins, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) (18), attracting and localizing leukocytes to areas of inflammation.

LTβR, CD40, and some other TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-binding TNFRSF members activate NFκB2/p100 by a distinct mechanism (18–22). This NFκB pathway, which mediates the processing of p100 to p52, is dependent on the NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IKKα but is independent of IKKB and IKKγ (18, 22–24). Activation of the p52/RelB pathway by LTβR signaling results in the translocation of the NFκB dimers to the nucleus, leading to gene transcription involved in the development of lymphoid organs and maintenance of architecture in secondary lymphoid organs. Like LTβR−/− mice, alymphoplasia (aly) mice, containing a point mutation in the TRAF binding region of NIK which is required to activate the IKKα complex, and NIK−/− mice lack secondary lymphoid organs and have disrupted splenic microarchitecture (24, 25).

The phenotypes of mice deleted for various NFκB members are complex affecting development and immune functions,

Fig. 2. Lymphoid organ formation involves multiple genes. The diagram depicts two cell types required for formation of secondary lymphoid organs, the lymphotoxin (LT) αβ-expressing 'inducer' cell (red) and the LTβR+ mesenchyme (gray). The inducer cell (CD4+CD3−) that gives rise to lymph nodes (LNi) or Peyer's patches (PPi) requires the action of transcription factors solidus inhibitor of differentiation-2 (ID2), Ikaros, and retinoid-related orphan receptor γ (RORγ). Receptor activator of NFκB (RANK) and TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF6)

are necessary for induction of LTαβ on the LNi, whereas IL-7Ra is essential for LTαβ expression by the PPi. NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) transcription factors RelA, RelB, and p52 are thought to act in mesenchyme. The CXCR5-CXCL13 chemokine system recruits the inducer cells to the lymphoid-specific mesenchyme in the developing embryo. The genes involved in lymphoid organogenesis were identified in mice that lack some secondary lymphoid organs.

Mesenteric LN and less severe disruption of splenic microarchitecture) that of LTα−/− or LTβR−/− mice, implicated that another mechanism is operative, perhaps another ligand. LIGHT was postulated as a likely candidate, as it is also a ligand for the LTβR. A careful accounting of mesenteric LNs by Scheu and colleagues (34) in LIGHT/LTβ double knockout mice revealed LIGHT as a redundant contributor to the development of mucosal (mesenteric) LNs. The complement of LNs in HVEM−/− mice is normal, suggesting that LTα-HVEM system is not contributing to LN development. By contrast, mice deficient in both LTβ and TNFR1 completely lack LNs (35), yet mice lacking LTβ and TNF are not deficient in mucosal LNs. The possibility exists that another ligand paired with LTα or a ligand for TNFR1 may lurk offstage as a contributing signaling system (34). Alternatively, perhaps in the absence of normal ligands, LTβR may infrequently spontaneously activate signaling, which is not inconceivable given the propensity of LTβR and other TNFR to activate signaling when even modestly overexpressed.

The LN-deficient phenotype is found in several other knockout mice, delineating the framework of a signaling pathway involved in mammalian organ development. Ikaros, inhibitor of differentiation-2 (ID2), and retinoid-related orphan receptor γ are transcriptional regulators essential for lymphocyte progenitors or LN-inducer cells to develop (36–40). Mice deficient in certain members of the NFκB activation pathway, including NIK, IKKα, and RelA and RelB, are missing LNs. Moreover, biochemical data strongly support a pathway initiated by LTβR in which signaling flows from receptor to NIK → IKKα → p100/p52 processing and subsequent formation of NFκB2 (RelB) complex. Potential target genes activated by the LTαβ-LTβR-NFκB pathway include the lymphocyte organizing chemokines, such as CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21.

Mice deficient in CXCR5, the receptor for CXCL13, show defective lymphoid organ structure, as do CCR7−/− mice (receptor for CCL19/CCL21). It is not known whether the LT pathway controls the expression of these chemokine receptors.

An interesting but perplexing discordance between genetic and biochemical evidence arises with the TRAF adapters. From biochemical models, TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5 are implicated in the LTβR signaling mechanism, yet deletion of these TRAF genes in mice (including double knockout of TRAF2 and TRAF5) failed to disrupt LN development (however, other dramatic phenotypes are present) (41–43). LTβR does not engage TRAF6, yet unexpectedly LN deficiency was found in TRAF6−/− mice. Moreover, when genetically deleted, the TNF-related activation-induced cytokine/receptor activator of NFκB (RANK) ligand (TNFSF11) RANK system, which utilizes TRAF6 as an adapter, revealed a LN-deficient phenotype (44). Interestingly, PPs are present in TRAF6−/− mice, which is just the opposite phenotype of the IL-7Ra-deficient mice; IL-7Ra−/− mice possess LN remnants but lack PPs. In this case, experimental results by Yoshida and colleagues (45) point to the regulation of LTαβ expression by RANK on the LN-inducer cell and by IL-7 on the PP-inducer cell. These results suggest a TRAF-independent mechanism may be involved in LTβR signaling during LN formation.

Microarchitecture

The development of the spleen is independent of LT, although the microarchitecture of the splenic white pulp requires the LTβR signaling pathway for development and maintenance in the adult. Features of the splenic architecture include the integrity of the MZ and the presence of MZ macrophages,
the function of stromal cells that allow recruitment and clustering of B cells in the follicle and T-cell migration into the T-cell zone, and the formation of follicular dendritic cell (FDC) networks and germinal centers (GCs) during immune responses (Fig. 3). The architecture of the spleen provides additional insight into the molecular components and target genes regulated by the LTαβ-LTβR system, yet some of these phenotypes are intertwined with developmental processes and may not be truly homeostatic. LTα-deficient mice have a dramatic loss in expression of the lymphocyte organizing chemokines CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21; similarly, mice deficient in CXCR5, CCR7, and their ligands exhibit deficiencies in LN formation and splenic architecture, indicating these genes likely form a common pathway. Ansel and colleagues (46) developed the idea that a reciprocating LTαβ-chemokine amplification circuit is essential for proper formation of splenic white pulp architecture. B cells play a vital role in forming the FDC network as well as the T-cell zone. A circuit is formed by migration of B cells to LTβR+ stromal cells expressing CXCL13, which in turn induces expression of LTαβ on B cells (46, 47). Interestingly, as B cells leave lymphoid organs to enter the blood (46), the expression of LTαβ is lost, but as they emigrate to the B-cell areas in response to CXCL13, they regain surface expression. Similar circuits are thought to be involved in maintaining the T-cell zone through the action of CCR7 binding chemokines, CCL19 and CCL21, in gp38-expressing stromal cells (47, 48).

Distinguishing between signals required for homeostasis from those involved in developmental processes has been difficult to sort out in LT gene-deficient mice. Pharmacologic inactivation of LTαβ in the adult animal by injection of a soluble decoy receptor comprised of the ectodomain of LTβR fused to Fc of immunoglobulin G (IgG) can theoretically distinguish these events. Treatment with LTβR-Ig dissolved discrete B-cell follicles, altered the MZ, prevented GC formation in the spleen, and impaired Ig production in response to immunization (49). However, treatment of adult mice with LTβR-Ig only partially (50%) knocked down the level of CXCL13 mRNA but did not affect CCL19 and CCL21 expression. The LTβR-Ig administered to neonates was more effective in changing chemokine levels than in adults, leading to the conclusion that LT signals are required for the full development and differentiation of chemokine-producing stromal cells. Conditional knockout of LTβ in B cells (B-LTβ KO) revealed CXCL13 was also only partially dependent on LT, whereas the expression of CCL19 and CCL21 required for the T-cell zone was normal. Although LNs and PPs develop in the conditional knockout, expression of LT probably is restricted also during neonatal differentiation of the splenic stroma. Thus, B-cell production of LTαβ is not an exclusive pathway for maintaining CXCL13 or other chemokines. Interestingly, enforced expression of LIGHT in T cells (transgenic lck promoter) when crossed with LTα−/−mice restored CCL21 but not CXCL13 expression, yet it corrected T-and B-cell segregation (50). TNF/LTα-TNFR1 systems may further contribute to the expression of the lymphocyte organizing chemokines in the spleen and nonlymphoid organs (31, 35). Interestingly, LTβ expression by B lymphocytes is important for proper MZ structure and FDC networks, yet when LTβ was conditionally deleted in both B and T cells, disruption of the splenic microarchitecture became even more exaggerated (51). Thus, both B-and T-cell expression of LTαβ, TNF, and LIGHT and perhaps others may contribute to the regulation of the tissue-organizing chemokines that impart selected features of the splenic microarchitecture.

Lymphotoxins in innate and adaptive immunity

Chemokines (e.g. CCL21) and adhesion molecules [e.g. intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)] appear to be important target genes for the development and organization of secondary lymphoid tissue, but they do not appear to account for all the events triggered by LT/LIGHT involved in innate and adaptive immunity (Table 3), some of which were recently revealed from the study of infectious and autoimmune disease

LT signaling in innate immunity

The IFN system is a cornerstone of the effector arm of innate immunity to viral pathogens linked to the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the earliest pathogen recognition system (52, 53). The type I IFNs include IFNβ and IFNα that signal via a common receptor IFNαβR (54). IFNβ is a first response gene induced through one or more of the TLRs (TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7) that leads to the activation of the transcriptional enhanceosome comprised of three transcription factors, IFN response factor-3, NFkB1/RelA and AP1/cJun and HMG1(Y), and p300/CBP (55) that controls IFNβ mRNA production. IFNβ-IFNαβR binding activates the Janus kinase (Jak)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 pathway leading to the expression of a host of IFN-dependent genes that create the antiviral state, which establishes a nonpermissive cellular environment for virus replication and spread. IFNβ also acts in an autocrine fashion to activate multiple IFNα genes amplifying the antiviral response. In addition to eliciting an antiviral state in all cells, IFNβ has remarkable effects on other aspects of innate and adaptive cells, particularly on induction of DC maturation and differentiation of natural killer (NK) cells.

The LTαβ-IFNβ axis

Limiting virus replication by inducing cell death prior to completion of the viral replication cycle via TNFR1 is an efficient mechanism of suppressing replication of some viruses (56). An additional strategy involving LTβR-dependent induction of IFNβ was revealed from investigation of human cytomegalovirus (CMV; β-herpesvirus) (57). This novel pathway required both cytokine signaling and virus replication to induce IFNβ mRNA, demonstrating cooperativity between host and virus. Human CMV blocks the induction of IFNβ in infected cells (57–59), yet signaling by LT-related ligands through either LTβR or TNFR1 circumvented this virus-imposed block on IFNβ induction. Induction of IFNβ required NFkB1/RelA activation but was independent of apoptosis pathways activated by either TNFR1 or LTβR. IFNβ imposed a reversible stasis on the human CMV replication cycle at a point following expression of immediate early genes but prior to virion release and inhibited spread in infected fibroblasts

(57). Although IFN restricts replication, the viral genome was maintained in the host cell, which was not killed, thus establishing a state of host-virus coexistence (détente). Evidence that the LT pathway is physiologically significant for resistance to mouse CMV (MCMV) stems from the observation that LTα−/− mice [on the C57Bl/6 genetic background, which are resistant to MCMV (60)] are highly susceptible to infection by MCMV with a 100-fold decrease in LD50 (57). The susceptibility was not linked to the absence of secondary lymphoid organs, as mice expressing LTβR-Ig decoy as a transgene, which possess LNs, also succumbed to lethal infection with MCMV. Whether the LT-IFNβ axis revealed in human cells is conserved in mice is not yet known. However, IFN plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of DCs and NK cells, which are also impacted by LT pathways.

Dendritic cells

DCs mature in response to signaling by TLR and IFN, becoming the most efficient cell type at presenting antigen to naive T cells (61). LT signaling is required for DC migration to appropriate locations within secondary lymphoid organs and at extralymphatic sites of infection during immune responses (62, 63). The tissue-organizing chemokines CCL21 and CCL19 can recruit DCs to lymphoid organs and sites of inflammation, predicting that LT/TNF signaling may contribute to the biological functions of DCs (64–67). LT-and TNF-deficient mice showed that the differentiation of DCs in bone marrow (BM) was reduced in the TNFR1−/− mice, but it was normal in the LTα−/−, LTβ−/−, and LTβR−/− mice (63). However, reduced numbers of DCs in spleens were found in LT-deficient mice, pointing to a defect in DC migration and probably accounted for by lower levels of the chemokines in the spleen (63), yet in nonlymphoid tissue the numbers of DCs increased in LT-deficient mice (62). Defects in the secondary lymphoid architecture do not account for DC migration defects, as LTβR-Ig decoy treatment for only a short period of time in wildtype mice impacted the migration of DCs into the T- and B-cell zones without reorganizing architecture (62).

HVEM and LTβR are both expressed on DCs, suggesting either pathway may regulate DC functions. Recently, it was demonstrated that LIGHT induces the maturation of monocyte-derived DCs and the upregulation of costimulatory molecules in a cooperative fashion with CD40L (68). LIGHT stimulates DCs most likely through its interaction with HVEM, as blocking of HVEM with an antagonistic monoclonal antibody abrogated LIGHT-mediated DC maturation (68).Natural killer cells

LTs play an important but not fully defined role in the development of NK cells. LTα⁻/⁻ and LTβR⁻/⁻ mice exhibit a 50–70% reduction in splenic and BM NK cells; moreover, there is a drastic impairment in NK cell function as measured by antitumor activity (69–72). BM transfer experiments showed that the activation of LTβR-expressing stromal cells in the BM is required for the full development of NK cells. Additional experiments with LTβR-Ig fusion protein treatment of wildtype mice support a role for LTβR signaling not only during the development but also for the maintenance of NK cell homeostasis in the adult mouse (71). A link between IL-15, an essential cytokine for NK cell development and activation, with LT signaling does not appear to be critical, as IL-15 expression is not impaired in the BM of LTα⁻/⁻ mice, and NK cell progenitors in LTα⁻/⁻ mice are responsive to IL-15 (69, 71). It remains to be answered which cell type provides the ligand for the LTβR on BM stromal cells. T- and B-cell-deficient RAG⁻/⁻ and SCID mice retain functional NK cells, most likely to be limited to LTαβ expression on the NK-inducer cell progenitor (73).

LTα⁻/⁻ mice challenged with NK cell-susceptible tumor cells showed enhanced tumor growth and spread, which was associated with a lower number of NK cells in the LTα⁻/⁻ mice and their slower migration from the BM to the peripheral organs (70). The authors reported only a slight downregulation of perforin protein expression and no impairment in IFNγ production, thus recruitment alone does not explain the NK deficiency. Smyth et al. (72) compared the cytotoxic capacity of NK cells from LTα⁻/⁻ mice and wildtype mice on a per cell basis and found reduced cytotoxic capacity of NK cells from LTα⁻/⁻ mice. Consequently, a defect in LTβR signaling not only contributes to a defect in NK cell development but also effector function. The expression on activated NK cells in humans supports the notion of LTαβ as an effector system in NK cell defenses (74).

LT signaling pathways are likely to impact innate defenses at several points. First, LTs regulate the developmentally associated formation of lymphoid organ architecture and chemokine expression necessary to recruit DCs and NK cells to appropriate sites of reactions. LTs are also required for proper NK cell development and differentiation. The LT-IFN axis may be linked to the inadequate responses of NK cells. The link between LT and MCMV resistance may also reflect a defect in plasmacytoid DCs, which are identified as the main IFNβ-producing cell in response to MCMV (75, 76), although not in response to all viral pathogens. However, the story with CMV is not likely limited to NK cells or DCs, as

adaptive immune functions are required for resistance to CMV (77, 78).

LT signaling in adaptive immunity

Both LT and LIGHT are expressed on antigen-activated lymphocytes of the adaptive immune response and act as important immunomodulators, a process that if unregulated may lead to inflammation and autoimmunity. In fact, dys-regulated expression of several members of the TNFSF leads to autoimmune-like diseases in humans and animal models. The lymphoproliferative (lpr) disorder in mice (deficiency in Fas; gld has defective FasL) is the most pronounced phenotype where lack of signaling leads to dysregulation of T cells and an autoaggressive phenotype. On the other side, enforced expression that overrides the normal transient signaling of TNF ligands, such as TNF and LIGHT, causes severe autoimmune/inflammatory diseases (79–81), yet gene deletions in TNF or LIGHT have limited or slower onset of autoimmune phenotypes. These types of results have implicated members of the TNF superfamily as immune regulators and support the notion that LTαβ and LIGHT pathways might contribute to the regulation of adaptive responses.

Tolerance

The initiation of self-tolerance, by creating a T-cell repertoire that is unresponsive to self-antigen, is crucial to ensure a productive immune response is generated while avoiding the induction of autoimmunity. Self-tolerance is mediated both by central mechanisms occurring in the thymus during the development of mature thymocytes as well as by peripheral mechanisms of mature lymphocytes in peripheral tissues. Central tolerance to self-antigens is established during thymic development by presentation of self-antigens on medullary thymic epithelium eliminating T cells by apoptosis that are overtly reactive to those self-antigens, a process referred to as negative selection. AIRE is a transcription factor that controls expression of antigens on MEC for the purpose of deleting the autoreactive T cells. AIRE-deficient mice (and humans) develop pronounced autoimmune disease (82). A potential mechanism controlling AIRE expression was revealed by Chin and coworkers (83), who showed that LT signaling through the LTβR regulates AIRE mRNA in the thymus. This is consistent with the finding that LTβR signaling, presumably through NIK, is required for the proper differentiation and steady state numbers of thymic epithelial cells (84). Intriguingly, the autoimmune phenotypes observed in mice
deficient for LT, including perivascular lymphocytic infiltration of activated cells and the production of autoantibodies such as anti-insulin, support a role for LT in maintaining central tolerance. Interestingly, RelB⁻/⁻ mice also display defects in AIRE expression as well as more severe defects in thymic development compared with LT-deficient mice, suggesting that the RelB-p52 NFκB pathway may be involved in LTβR-mediated expression of AIRE in the thymus (83).

A role for LIGHT in the development of T cells in the thymus was recently recognized by Fu and coworkers (85) using an in vitro model of negative selection. In this model, the introduction of the antigenic N-formylated peptide LemA to D7 (TCR-restricted) transgenic thymic organs mediates negative selection, and the authors showed that either LTβR-Ig or HVEM-Ig, used to differentially block LIGHT signaling, inhibited negative selection resulting in an increase in the percentage of double positive and CD8⁺ single positive cells. Likewise, a similar reduction in negative selection by blocking LIGHT signaling was obtained using the male antigen H-Y TCR Tg in vivo model of negative selection. Consistent with these findings, constitutive expression of LIGHT on thymocytes (under the control of the proximal lck promoter and CD2 enhancer that shows high level transgene expression on all thymocyte subsets) also showed impaired thymus development and a reduction in the numbers of double positive thymocytes, an effect that was due to increased thymocyte apoptosis in the LIGHT-Tg mice (85). Interestingly, LIGHT-mediated apoptosis of immature thymocytes is restricted to specific TCR⁺ thymocytes recognizing MHC/self-peptide, characteristic of negative selection, as opposed to a global effect on total thymocytes (86). Although both HVEM and LTβR may play a role in the LIGHT-mediated negative selection, studies crossing the LIGHT-Tg animals to LTβR⁻/⁻ mice suggest that signaling via the LTβR is critical for negative selection (86). Thus, LTβR signaling is critically important for mediating negative selection and ultimately central tolerance by regulating the differentiation of MECs to upregulate AIRE expression and also by mediating LIGHT-induced apoptosis of self-reactive thymocytes.

A role for LT/LIGHT in regulating mechanisms of peripheral tolerance have not been directly defined, although the ability of LIGHT to function as a costimulatory molecule suggests that dysregulation of LIGHT might affect aspects of peripheral tolerance. Recent studies have revealed that constitutive expression of LIGHT within the T-cell compartment leads to autoimmune and tissue destructive processes caused by activated T cells (80, 81). In those studies, expression of human LIGHT under the CD2 promoter or lck promoters revealed

differences in pathology, a phenomenon that is most likely due to tissue-specific expression by these promoters, as CD2 is expressed in T and some B cells, whereas lck is active in thymocytes and peripheral T cells. However, both lines of transgenic mice showed severe inflammation in the intestine characterized by increased CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, and other chronic processes including loss of goblet cells, distortion and hyperplasia of crypts, villous atrophy, and mononuclear cell infiltrates. This phenotype is characteristic of autoimmune colitis, a disease that in mice can be neutralized with an LTβR-Ig decoy receptor (87). Curiously, susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease has been linked to the chromosome 19p13.3 (88), a gene-rich region containing the LIGHT/CD27L/41BBL loci (12, 89), suggesting that LIGHT may have an important physiological role in mediating aspects of intestinal inflammation. LIGHT transgenic mice, under the control of the lck promoter, also showed more severe signs of systemic autoimmunity, complete with elevated anti-DNA antibodies and rheumatoid factors. Thus, constitutive expression of LIGHT causes dysregulated homeostasis of T- and B-cell responses ultimately leading to a breakdown in peripheral tolerance. Whether this effect is independent of central tolerance is unaddressed.

T-cell costimulation and effector responses

A role for HVEM in costimulation was originally postulated when it was realized that HVEM is located on Chr1p36 in close proximity to other TNFRs, including CD30, 4-1BB, OX40, and TNFR2, that are expressed on T cells and have known roles in T-cell-mediated costimulation (90). In those initial studies, it was demonstrated that a soluble HVEM:Fc receptor inhibited an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction, suggesting that inhibiting the interaction of HVEM with its ligand prevents optimal T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Studies in mice deficient in LIGHT support a role for the LIGHT-HVEM pathway in regulating T-cell immune responses, as several groups have established that CD8⁺ T cells from LIGHT-deficient mice have reduced in vitro proliferative responses induced by anti-CD3 when compared with wildtype mice (34, 91, 92), a result that supports the finding that recombinant human LIGHT induces costimulation of purified T cells in the presence of suboptimal anti-CD3 (93). Upon stimulation of T-cell responses in vivo with the bacterial superantigen Staphylococcal enterotoxin B, the expansion of CD8⁺ but not CD4⁺ T cells was significantly reduced in LIGHT⁻/⁻ mice. Likewise, the observation that CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) generation and cytokine production were specifically

Schneider et al·Lymphotoxin and LIGHT signaling

decreased in LIGHT-/- mice in response to an MHC class I-restricted peptide supports a selective role for LIGHT in CD8+ T-cell activation (91). A role for LIGHT in CTL differentiation has been confirmed in several animal models; CTL activity and regression of tumors was induced by forced expression of LIGHT in the tumor environment (94, 95), whereas CTL activity was reduced by treatment of mice with LTβR-Ig in a model of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that is mediated by orchestrated alloreactive immune responses (94, 96). Future experiments are required to delineate a role for HVEM or LTβR in the LIGHT-mediated effects on CD8+ T-cell responses, although the expression of HVEM but not LTβR on T cells suggests HVEM as a more likely candidate.

Although LTαβ has not been shown to play a role in costimulation, LT may participate in the effector functions of T cells, as it is rapidly expressed on effector Th1 cells but is downregulated by IL-4 during differentiation into Th2 cells (97). A role for LT in Th1 and Th2 immune responses is supported in a study by Kang et al. (98) demonstrating that LTα-/- mice exhibit asthma-like symptoms characterized by increased airway inflammation and reduced levels of IgE in response to environmental and antigenic stimuli. The recent finding that LT signaling induces a gene called SMUCKLER [identical to T-cell Ig-and mucin-domain-containing molecule (TIM4)] may provide a mechanism for the asthma-like phenotype in LTα-/- mice, as functions of other TIM family members are linked to Th1/Th2 balance and susceptibility to asthma (99).

phenotypic disease, by inhibiting the expression of ICAM-1 on dermal microvascular endothelium, thereby preventing the infiltration of T cells into the skin (100). B-cell responses are also defective in LT-deficient mice, a phenomenon that is associated with a failure to develop and maintain FDC clusters and to form GCs, as opposed to an intrinsic defect on B cells to produce antibodies. Consequently, LTα-/- mice fail to generate both primary and secondary IgG responses to foreign antigen, due to defects in effective isotype class switching and affinity maturation (101), a defect that is dependent on B-cell expression of LTα (51, 102). This may in part be due to the induced expression of the chemokine CXCL13 on follicular stromal cells by B-cell-derived LT, which is important for B-cell migration into lymphoid follicles and for recruitment of a specialized subset of DCs, the CR domain of the mannose receptor (CR-Fc+) DCs (103). CR-Fc+ DCs are unique in that they specifically migrate toward B-cell follicles, accumulate in developing GCs after immunization, and play an important role in the early activation of B cells and antibody production. Neither LTα-/- nor LTβR-/- mice have CR-Fc+ DCs in the spleen. Besides IgG responses, IgA responses are also reduced in LTα-/- mice, due to a defect in the migration of B1B cells to the lamina propria owing to reduced levels of chemokines and adhesion molecules, such as CXCL13 and MAdCAM-1, in the gut (104). Importantly, these results suggest that the consequences of LT signaling on lymphoid tissue microenvironments are not just developmentally fixed, but in the adult, they can directly modulate the generation of immune responses.

Immune cell recruitment and immune induction

LT/LIGHT signaling appears to play an important role in inducing the expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules (18) that are crucial for inducing the migration of immune cells to sites of infection and immune induction. In fact, several studies have revealed the importance of LT signaling to induce immune cell recruitment and thereby indirectly promote T- and B-cell responses. Forced expression of LIGHT in tumor tissues upregulates production of the chemokine CCL21 and the expression of the mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) by interacting with the LTβR on the infiltrating stroma, resulting in the recruitment and expansion of naive T cells in the tumor tissue. This activity culminates in the breakdown of immune tolerance and rejection of well-established tumors at local and distal sites (95). In another model, blockade of LTβR signaling by LTβR-Ig ameliorated graft-versus-host skin disease, a model that requires the infiltration of T cells into the skin to generate

Relevance to human disease models

The impact of the LT/LIGHT system on B- and T-cell responses described above suggests that these molecules might be critically important for the manifestation of immune-mediated disease. Indeed, several studies have reported a significant role for the LT system in autoimmune diseases using various mouse models of human disease. Autoimmunity results when immune responses are directed to self-antigens and can be caused by autoantibodies and/or autoreactive T cells. Given that LTαβ and LIGHT function in the development of thymocytes, T-cell activation, and in isotype class switching and affinity maturation, it is not surprising that signaling induced by these cytokines would play a role in autoimmune disease. Unfortunately, the role of LT/LIGHT involvement in human disease has been difficult to study given the underlying developmental defects in lymphoid architecture in LT-deficient animals, which can complicate studies of immune disease.
Most studies assessing a role of LTαβ or LIGHT in models of autoimmune disease have relied on the use of an LTβR-Ig fusion protein, which inhibits the binding of the ligands to their respective receptors without the undesired effects on lymphoid development. Unfortunately, many of the studies have been unable to distinguish between the contributions of LTαβ or LIGHT to disease progression, a problem that can only be resolved with the advent of more specific reagents. The role of LT/LIGHT in autoimmune disease has recently been reviewed (5).

Arthritis

In an animal model of collagen-induced arthritis, a disease with similarities to human rheumatoid arthritis, disease is initiated following immunization with chick type II collagen (CII) resulting in the forced recognition of self-antigen. When mice were first treated with LTβR-Ig several weeks before immunization with CII, arthritis did not develop (105). In contrast, if mice were treated with the fusion protein on the same day as immunization, disease did develop but it was milder, and further LTβR-Ig treatment could suppress already established disease (105). The effects of blocking LT/LIGHT signaling were also observed in related models of induced arthritis. The mechanism for reduced pathogenesis of disease following LTβR treatment is likely due to the effects of the fusion protein treatment on the organization of the micro-environment within the draining LN, since in both the LN and spleen, FDC networks were eliminated resulting in decreased autoantibodies to CII. As described previously, the maintenance of FDC clusters by LT is necessary for antibody responses and effective isotype class switching. However, it is likely that LTαβ and LIGHT could also be affecting other parameters of disease including innate components of early recognition, T-cell responses, and chemokine production required for the generation of an immune response.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a T-cell-mediated inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that in one model can be induced by immunization with myelin-basic protein in adjuvant. A role for the LT/LIGHT system in EAE has been controversial in most part because many mouse models of EAE require the use of pertussis toxin (PTx) to induce blood-brain barrier permeability. However, PTx also acts to inhibit G protein-coupled chemokine receptor signaling, a function that is critically linked to LT signaling, as well as the expression of LT itself (5). A recent study by Gommerman et al. (106), utilizing models of EAE that are independent of the requirement for PTx, demonstrated that LTβR-Ig treatment prevents EAE disease. This result was surprising as EAE is predominantly a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease and thus points to a role for LTαβ in T-cell responses. In fact, treatment of mice with LTβR-Ig in the EAE model resulted in impaired secondary T-cell responses to EAE autoepitopes, with no defect on the early stages of T-cell priming and expansion, suggesting a role for LTαβ in T-cell maturation (106). However, it is likely that the regulatory effects of LTαβ/LIGHT on T-cell function may be both direct and indirect, given the distribution of receptors and effects such as chemokine-directed migration and maintenance of lymphoid architecture.

Diabetes

Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the selective destruction of insulin-secreting β cells. IDDM can be studied using nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, where infiltration of autoreactive T cells into the islets is required for disease progression. LTβR-Ig treatment of NOD mice blocked the development of diabetes (107, 108). In this model, Wu and colleagues (107) reported that the mechanism for reduced disease by LTβR-Ig was attributed to impaired ability of inflammatory and autoreactive T cells to migrate to newly formed lymphoid follicles in the pancreas. In contrast, studies by Ettinger et al. (108), using mice that expressed a neutralizing LTβR-Ig chimeric transgene backcrossed onto the NOD background, did not observe the differences in pancreatic infiltrates, although they did detect reduced responses of splenocytes to the pancreatic autoantigen glutamate decarboxylase. Thus, it is unclear whether the effects of LTβR-Ig treatment of NOD mice prevents diabetes by inhibiting the activation of T cells or by regulating the expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules necessary for the formation of lymphoid tissues. As LTβR-Ig can block signaling induced by both LTαβ and LIGHT, it is likely that the mechanism is more complex involving contributions of both ligands or that one ligand may predominate by an undefined mechanism.

Infectious disease models

LTs play a significant role in both innate and adaptive immune processes. Host defense relies on efficient integration of innate and adaptive systems, where cytokines provide the communication signals among various cells and tissues. Thus, the consequences of LT signaling should be most obvious

following challenge with infectious agents. The results from several models indicate that LT-dependent architecture is a key element in some responses, although other models support the idea that LT/LIGHT contribute to host defense to infectious pathogens.

Host defense may be compromised in LT-deficient mice from a general inadequacy due to structural defects in lymphoid organs or from a lack of signaling required during infection (effector responses). Distinguishing between the LT/TNF/LIGHT-dependent developmental processes and effector signaling required during infection remains a concern in interpretation of various models. Reconstituting wildtype BM cells into LT-deficient mice (containing developmentally fixed architectural defects) should lead to failed immune control, although the reciprocal chimera (LT deficient → wildtype) should behave as wildtype if signaling is not required during infection.

Evidence for structural defects contributing to failed T-cell responses comes from work on lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model, which depends on a CD8⁺ T-cell response to control virus (109). Radiation chimeras showed that both antigen-specific CD8⁺ and CD4⁺ T cells were impaired in a LTα-deficient environment. LTα⁻/⁻ but not TNF⁻/⁻ mice are highly susceptible to Theiler's virus, a demyelinating virus, yet treatment of mice with LTβR-Ig caused no change in susceptibility, indicating that LT-dependent organogenesis is important for host defense (110). A similar conclusion was reached for LTβ⁻/⁻ mice following infection with Leishmania major, a parasite that requires DC and Th1 cytokine responses for control of infection (111).

Infection with intracellular bacterial pathogens (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes) revealed remarkable failures of host defense in LT-deficient mice (112–114). LTβR⁻/⁻ BM chimeras (LTβR⁻/⁻ → wildtype recipient) revealed an essential need for LTβR signaling by BM cells during infection with M. tuberculosis (112), reflected by a significant increase in bacterial load in lungs, spleens, and livers and higher mortality compared with wildtype BM recipients. Failure of LTβR⁻/⁻ mice appeared to be linked to inefficient expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) in tissue macrophages.

Somewhat in contrast, LTα⁻/⁻ but not LTβ⁻/⁻ chimeras (113) were highly susceptible to M. tuberculosis infection, and interestingly, T-cell activation and IFNγ release in those mice appeared to be normal as was the expression of TNF and NOS2 by macrophages. Containment of M. tuberculosis infection in the lung requires the recruitment of T cells and macrophages to form granulomas. However, the LTα⁻/⁻ chimeric mice showed abnormal granuloma formation in their lungs, in which T cells failed to migrate into the infected tissue. The higher bacterial load observed in LTα-deficient mice most likely results from an impaired inflammatory response and subsequent granuloma formation. Together, the results suggest a role of LTα3 signaling through TNFR or perhaps HVEM in regulating the production of chemokines that lead to the migration of T cells into the infected tissue, whereas signaling by LTαβ-LTβR pathway contributes to host defense in ways distinct from TNF/LTα-TNFR1. Unlike the results reported for LTα⁻/⁻ chimeric mice, the LTβR⁻/⁻ chimeras did not show a defect in T-cell migration and granuloma formation but exhibited impaired NOS2 expression in lung granulomas, the basis of which is unclear. However, in a related model (M. bovis BCG) treatment of mice with LTβR-Ig interfered with granuloma formation by inhibiting macrophage activation and NOS activity (114), which supports the idea that effector signaling by LTβR pathway is important for host defense. In this situation, LIGHT and LTαβ could be redundant for protection by signaling via the LTβR, and thus studies in LTβ/LIGHT double knockout mice will be informative. Activated macrophages express LTβR on their surface, which makes it plausible that LTβR signaling might be necessary for efficient NOS2 production. However, type I IFNs are important inducers of NOS2 expression, and one could imagine a similar dependence of IFNα/β and subsequent NOS2 production on LTβR signaling, perhaps akin to IFN induction in the CMV model (57).

Deficiency in LT, whether lymphoid organ or effector mechanisms are considered, does not cause impaired host defense in all situations. For instance, LCMV infection of NZB mice, which results in a lethal pulmonary inflammation (115), are rescued by treatment with LTβR-Ig, with efficient viral clearance but reduced virus-specific CD8⁺ T cells and reduced IFNγ production, which likely limit lethal lung inflammation. Individual species of Herpesviridae, large DNA viruses with a variety of immune evasion mechanisms, show a spectrum of differences in the importance of the LT signaling for host defenses. Host defense to mouse γ-herpesvirus (MHV-68), which relies on CD4⁺ T cells and antibody, in LTα⁻/⁻ mice was effective with only a modest delay in mounting effector cells leading to viral clearance and control of latency (116). By contrast, infection of LTα⁻/⁻ mice with HSV-1 (α-herpesvirus) showed enhanced susceptibility to develop encephalitis (117), with an underlying failure of virus-specific CD8⁺ T cells to differentiate into effector cells as measured by IFNγ expression after stimulation with antigen. Even more dramatically, MCMV (β-herpesvirus),
which is initially controlled by IFN and NK cells, is lethal in LTα⁻/⁻ mice (57).

The presence of nasal lymphoid tissue, which develops independent of LT signaling, suggests that LT-deficient mice may not be susceptible to respiratory infections (118). Responses to influenza were not dramatically impaired in LTα⁻/⁻ mice, although the appearance of a specific T-cell response was delayed (119). A similar argument could be made for resistance in LTα⁻/⁻ mice to MHV-68 infected via a respiratory route, although it disseminates to visceral organs. However, LTα⁻/⁻ mice are highly susceptible to respiratory infection with M. tuberculosis, suggesting the route of infection is not of primary importance in determining susceptibility.

These studies reinforce the concept that LT signaling, necessary for developmentally fixed aspects of lymphoid organ structure and as an effector system in innate and adaptive immune systems, contributes to effective host defense. Perhaps most surprising, the requirement for LT signaling is not uniform with respect to different pathogens, some require only organ structure (e.g. LCMV, Leishmania), some also need effector signaling (M. tuberculosis, CMV), and some show little dependence on LT signaling (influenza, MHV-68). Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, this variation in the requirement for LT signaling probably reflects specific contributions

from the pathogen used to evade the underlying LT-activated pathways (120, 121).

### Perspective

LTαβ and LIGHT pathways have emerged as important regulators of both innate and adaptive immune systems. The importance of these signaling pathways is underscored by their critical roles in the development of lymphoid organs and the differentiation of T cells and DCs, as well as NK and NKT cells. Moreover, the prominence in regulating adaptive and innate defenses is reflected in efficiency in host defense to specific viral and bacterial pathogens. Clearly, regulation of the NFκB family of transcription factors is a major target of these signaling pathways involved in regulating several key target genes, active in the development and effector responses including selected chemokines, the interferons, and adhesion molecules. Blockade of LT/LIGHT pathways as an intervention in controlling autoimmune diseases is highly attractive, but such therapy may also increase risk to some types of infectious diseases, not dissimilar to the side-effects encountered with the inhibitors of TNF and TNF/LTα. Identifying and understanding the functions of the genes targeted by the LT/LIGHT pathways may offer an opportunity to fine-tune inhibitory interventions, alleviating unwanted consequences of blocking these pathways.
