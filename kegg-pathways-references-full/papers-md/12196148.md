**Abstract**  
The biosynthesis of vitamin B₁₂ is summarized,  
emphasizing the differences observed between the  
aerobic and anaerobic pathways. The biosynthetic  
route to adenosylcobalamin from its five-carbon  
precursor, 5-aminolaevulinic acid, can be divided  
into three sections: (1) the biosynthesis of uro-  
porphyrinogen III from 5-aminolaevulinic acid,  
which is common to both pathways; (2) the  
conversion of uroporphyrinogen III into the ring-  
contracted, deacylated intermediate precorrin 6 or  
cobalt-precorrin 6, which includes the primary  
differences between the two pathways; and (3) the  
transformation of this intermediate to form adeno-  
sylcobalamin.

**Introduction**  
Vitamin B₁₂ (cobalamin) is manufactured by bac-  
teria and archaea via two alternative routes (for  
a recent review, see [1]) that differ primarily in  
the early stages that lead to the contraction of the  
macrocycle and excision of the extruded carbon  
molecule (and its attached methyl group). One  
pathway incorporates molecular oxygen into the  
macrocycle as a prerequisite to ring contraction,  
and has consequently been termed the aerobic  
pathway. The alternative, anaerobic, route takes  
advantage of a chelated cobalt ion, in the absence  
of oxygen, to set the stage for ring contraction.  
The intermediates of the aerobic biosynthetic  
route from uroporphyrinogen III (uro’gen III) to  
adenosylcobalamin have been determined [2] by  
the isolation of the genes from *Pseudomonas de-  
nitrificans* (*cobA–cobW*) and the assignment of the  
functions of the encoded enzymes based on their  
catalytic activity (Table 1, Scheme 1). Genes  
encoding proteins involved in the biosynthesis of  
cobalamin by the alternative anaerobic pathway  
(Table 1) have been isolated and sequenced from  
bacteria such as *Salmonella typhimurium* [2a],  
*Bacillus megaterium* [2b] and *Propionibacterium  
freudenreichii* (*shermanii*) [2c] and, while catalytic  
activity has been determined experimentally for a  
few of the gene products, most of their functions  
have been derived on the basis of sequence  
similarities.

The biosynthetic route to adenosylcobalamin  
from its five-carbon precursor, 5-aminolaevulinic  
acid (ALA), may, for convenience, be divided into  
three sections: (1) the biosynthesis of uro’gen III  
from ALA, which is shared by both pathways  
(Scheme 1); (2) the conversion of uro’gen III into

### Biosynthesis of adenosylcobalamin

#### Biosynthesis of uro'gen III

Uro'gen III is an intermediate not only of vitamin B₁₂ but also of haem, sirohaem, chlorophylls and factor F430. Its biosynthesis from ALA (Scheme 1) utilizing the enzymes ALA dehydratase (HemB), porphobilinogen deaminase (HemC)

and uro'gen III synthase (HemD) is well documented, and has recently been reviewed [3]. The most recent advance in elucidation of the biosynthesis of uro'gen III has been the unveiling of the crystallographic structure of human uro'gen III synthase [4], which revealed an interesting barrel-shaped conformation, but which did not shed any further light on the mechanism of the enzyme, due to the lack of a structure with bound substrate or other ligand. The absence of any essential conserved residues, however, as revealed by site-directed mutagenesis, suggests that the function of the enzyme is to hold the substrate in the correct conformation, with catalysis then proceeding spontaneously.

Biochemical Society Transactions (2002) Volume 30, part 4

**Conversion of uro'gen III into precorrin 6/cobalt–precorrin 6**

In the aerobic pathway (Scheme 1, light arrows) this process, resulting in the formation of precorrin 6, requires five S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases for the introduction of six methyl groups and is characterized by the incorporation of molecular oxygen by a mono-oxygenase. First, precorrin 2 is formed from uro'gen III by methylation at C-2 and C-7 by CobA, followed by methylation at C-20 by CobI to give precorrin 3. Incorporation of O₂, also at C-20, and the concomitant formation of a γ-lactone, both catalysed by CobG, to yield precorrin 3 hydroxylactone are prerequisites for contraction of the macrocycle. Ring contraction is then triggered by methylation at C-17 by CobJ to give precorrin 4, featuring a methylketone, derived from C-20 and its attached hydroxy and methyl groups, pendant to C-1. Precorrin 5 is formed by methylation of C-11 by CobM, and then, in the final step to form precorrin 6, the methylketone is lost as acetic acid upon methylation of C-1 by CobF.

The anaerobic pathway, resulting in cobalt–precorrin 6 rather than precorrin 6, also requires five methyltransferases, and is distinguished by the early incorporation of cobalt into the macrocycle. The biosynthesis of precorrin 2 is the same as in the aerobic pathway, with the exception that, in some organisms such as Salmonella typhimurium, the enzyme responsible (CysG) also has dehydrogenase and chelatase activities (CysGᴮ) associated with the methyltransferase (CysGᴬ), and is in fact also the enzyme responsible for sirohaem biosynthesis. However, a CobA-like enzyme with only methyltransferase activity is found in other organisms, such as Bacillus megaterium and Propionibacterium freudenreichii. After the synthesis of precorrin 2, the anaerobic route (Scheme 1, bold arrows) diverges from the aerobic route with the chelation of cobalt into the macrocycle to give cobalt–precorrin 2. Although CysG may function as the cobaltochelatase in S. typhimurium, this organism has a second enzyme, CbiK, that also displays cobaltochelatase activity [5]. B. megaterium and P. freudenreichii have no known homologues of the CysG or CbiK chelatases, but have a different enzyme, CbiX, that may function as the chelatase (M. J. Warren and C. A. Roessner, unpublished work). After the insertion of cobalt, the intermediates of the anaerobic pathway are cobalt complexes, whereas cobalt is not inserted until much later in the aerobic pathway, into hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide (see Scheme 2).

In the anaerobic pathway, cobalt–precorrin 2 is methylated at C-20 by CbiL to afford cobalt–precorrin 3. While this is the apparent route in S. typhimurium, it has been suggested [6] that sirohydrochlorin, the oxidized form of precorrin 2, is the substrate for cobalt insertion in other organisms, such as *Bacillus megaterium*.

The next known intermediate in the anaerobic pathway is cobalt–precorrin 4, which has been synthesized from cobalt–precorrin 3 in cell-free extracts of *Propionibacterium shermanii* [7] and cell-free extracts of *Escherichia coli* overexpressing the *S.* typhimurium CbiH protein [8]. Thus CbiH is responsible for addition of a methyl group at C-17, which, as in the aerobic pathway, triggers contraction of the macrocycle. In contrast with precorrin 4 of the aerobic pathway, however, cobalt–precorrin 4 bears an unopened δ-lactone (Scheme 1) instead of a methylketone. Although the next intermediate of the anaerobic pathway, corresponding to precorrin 5 (cobalt–precorrin 5), has yet to be isolated, the C-11 methyltransferase is believed to be CbiF, based on its identity with CobM. Also supporting this hypothesis is the observation that CbiF mismethylates precorrin 3 and cobalt–precorrin 3 at C-11 to yield a tetramethylpyrrocorphin in each case [9,10].

Another major difference that has been observed between the two pathways is that the carboxy group of the ring A acetate (C-27) undergoes extensive exchange with water from the medium in the anaerobic pathway, but not in the aerobic pathway. Additionally, in the former pathway, C-20 and its attached methyl group are excised as acetaldehyde [11], whose oxygen is derived from the carboxy group of the ring A acetate [12], whereas the oxygen-dependent route produces acetic acid directly, with no involvement of the ring A carboxy group. These differences must reflect dissimilarity in the steps required to convert precorrin 5 into precorrin 6 in the aerobic pathway and cobalt–precorrin 5 into cobalt–precorrin 6 in the anaerobic pathway (Scheme 1). The latter requires opening of the δ-lactone ring, excision of acetaldehyde and C-1 methylation. In the scenario shown in Scheme 1, exchange with water in the carboxy group of the ring A acetate results from hydration during opening of the δ-lactone, and the oxygen of the acetaldehyde is derived concomitantly from the ring A acetate during this process [12]. The enzyme catalysing this event remains to be identified, but since no

functions have been assigned as yet to the indispensable [13] CbiD and CbiG proteins, one or both of these may play a role. In addition, there are no enzymes within the known anaerobic repertoire for C-1 methylation and acetaldehyde-yielding hydrolysis that would convert cobalt-precorrin 5 into the next intermediate, cobalt-precorrin 6. Curiously, CobF, which is responsible for the similar process (deacylation, C-1 methylation) in the aerobic pathway (see Scheme 2), has no counterpart in *S.* typhimurium or any other organism with the anaerobic pathway, suggesting that one of the previously identified methyltransferases, perhaps CbiF, plays a second role in the production of vitamin B₁₂.

**Conversion of precorrin 6/cobalt-precorrin 6 into adenosylcobalamin**

The known pathway and enzymes necessary for the conversion of precorrin 6 into adenosylcobalamin in the aerobic pathway are listed in Table 1, and enzymes, cofactors, and the structures of the intermediates are shown in Scheme 2. The intermediates and homologous enzymes for the conversion of cobalt-precorrin 6 into adenosylcobalamin are also listed in Table 1. The structures of the intermediates of the anaerobic pathway between cobalt-precorrin 6 and adenosylcobalamin are believed to be the same as those of the aerobic pathway, with the exception that, since the cobalt ion is already in place, dihydro-precorrin 6, precorrin 8 and hydrogenobyrinic acid are replaced with the corresponding cobalt complexes. Indeed, it has been demonstrated [14] that precorrin 6 can be converted into cobyric acid in a cell-free extract of *Propionibacterium shermanii*, which utilizes the anaerobic pathway to cobalamin. Thus, in the anaerobic pathway, hydrogenobyrinic acid is replaced by cobyric acid, which then is the substrate for bisamidation to afford cob(II)yric acid *a,c*-diamide. All of the ensuing intermediates are identical in the aerobic and anaerobic pathways. The CobNST complex, required for insertion of cobalt into hydrogenobyrinic acid *a,c*-diamide, is not found in organisms with the anaerobic pathway.

One of the remaining mysteries of both pathways is the mechanism of the reduction of cob(II)byrinic acid *a,c*-diamide to form cob(I)-byrinic acid *a,c*-diamide prior to addition of the adenosyl group. Although the reductase of the aerobic pathway was isolated [15], neither the enzyme nor the gene encoding it has been identified. Recently, however, it was shown [16] that, *in vitro*, the *Salmonella typhimurium* NADP⁺: ferredoxin (flavodoxin) reductase (Fpr), in conjunction with reduced flavodoxin (FldA) and the adenosyltransferase (CobA), can convert Co(III) corrinoids into their adenosylated counterparts, suggesting that the Fpr and FldA proteins may be part of the required reducing system in this organism. The adenosyltransferase enzyme of *S.* typhimurium, CobA (not to be confused with the first methyltransferase that is also called CobA in *P.* denitrificans and other organisms), has been crystallized and its structure determined in the free state and in complexes with MgATP and with MgATP plus hydroxycobalamin [17]. Amidation of the *b, d, e* and *g* carboxylates by adenosylcobyric acid synthase results in the formation of adenosylcobyric acid (Scheme 2). A single enzyme, CobQ, is sufficient for the amidation of all four carboxy groups. There is a requirement in the substrate for the adenosyl group. The attachment of (*R*)-1-amino-2-propanol to adenosylcobyric acid affords adenosylcobinamide (Scheme 2). Two proteins (*α* and *β*) are involved in the aerobic pathway, and the reaction is dependent on ATP/Mg²⁺ and (*R*)-1-amino-2-propanol. CobC and CobD make up protein *β*, and protein *α* is encoded by a gene yet to be identified. The source of the isopropanolamine is believed to be threonine, but this has yet to be established genetically and enzymically. It has been shown [18] that the *S.* typhimurium CobD protein synthesizes (*R*)-1-amino-2-propanol O-2-phosphate by decarboxylation of L-threonine O-3-phosphate, and it was suggested that this compound is the true substrate. Attachment in the anaerobic pathway similarly appears to involve three gene products, including CbiB. Adenosylcobinamide is converted into adenosyl-GDP-cobinamide (Scheme 2) in two reactions mediated by a single bifunctional enzyme, CobP, in the aerobic pathway. The first reaction is ATP-dependent phosphorylation, which is followed by transfer of GMP from GTP, to form adenosylcobinamide phosphate and adenosyl-GDP-cobinamide respectively. CobU, the homologous enzyme in the anaerobic pathway of *S.* typhimurium, has been crystallized and its structure complexed with GMP determined [19]. Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicated that a conserved histidine (His-46) is the site of guanylation [20].

The final step of the pathway to the coenzyme B₁₂ is the substitution of the GMP of adenosyl-GDP-cobinamide with either α-ribazole or α-ribazole phosphate to afford adenosylcobalamin.

or its 5′ phosphate (Scheme 2). The responsible enzyme in the aerobic pathway, adenosylcobalamin (5′-phosphate) synthase, appears to be CobV, although this has not yet been confirmed, because the isolated activity was a mixture of six proteins in a high-molecular-mass complex. The homologous anaerobic enzyme is CobS. The α-ribazole phosphate required for this reaction is derived from dimethylbenzimidazole (DBI) and nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN), as shown in Scheme 2(inset). Mechanisms for both the aerobic and anaerobic biosynthesis of DBI have been proposed [21]. Synthesis of α-ribazole phosphate from DBI and NaMN in the aerobic pathway is performed by CobU. The structure of CobT of *S.* typhimurium, the corresponding enzyme of the anaerobic pathway, has been determined [22], and Glu-317 has been suggested as the catalytic base that is required for the reaction. This enzyme forms complexes not only with DBI but also with a wide variety of ligands [23], including adenine, 5-methylbenzimidazole, 5-methoxybenzimidazole, p-cresol and phenol. All of these except p-cresol and phenol react with NaMN to yield phosphoribosylated products, implying that the nature of the lower ligand is determined by metabolic factors rather than by the specificity of the phosphoribosyltransferase.

### Conclusions

The pathways to adenosylcobalamin, as they are believed to occur in aerobic bacteria and in anaerobic bacteria and archaea, are now complete. In the isolation process, adenosylcobalamin is converted into vitamin B₁₂ (cyanocobalamin) by substitution of the adenosyl moiety with cyanide. It is interesting to note that the ‘early’ anaerobic pathway dates to approx. 4 billion years ago, while the aerobic route evolved around 2 billion years later, when the Earth’s atmosphere was enriched with oxygen [8].
