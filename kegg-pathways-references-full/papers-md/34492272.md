ABSTRACT

The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway is characterized by diverse immune regulatory systems involving cell proliferation, survival, and inflammation and immune tolerance. Aberrant JAK/STAT transduction activates proinflammatory cytokine signaling that jeopardize the immune balance and thus contributes to the development of autoimmune diseases and cancer progression. The success of several small-molecule JAK inhibitors in the treatment of rheumatologic diseases demonstrates that targeting the JAK/STAT pathway is efficient in suppressing inflammation and sheds light on their therapeutic potential in several autoimmune diseases and cancers. In this review, we discuss the signal transduction and molecular mechanism involving immune function through the JAK-STAT pathway, outline the role of this pathway in autoimmunity and onc immunology, and explain the preclinical and clinical trial evidence for the therapeutic potential of targeting the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Issues regarding the safety and clinical efficacy of JAK inhibitors are reviewed. Ongoing studies are addressed with a focus on emerging indications for JAK inhibition and explanations of the novel mechanisms of JAK-STAT signaling blockade.

1. Introduction: JAKs and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway

The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway governs the cellular response to cytokines, interferons and growth factors by mediating intracellular signals to the nucleus to activate gene expression. JAKs belong to the intracellular, nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase family, which consists of four JAKs (JAK1-3 and TYK2) [1]. JAKs possess a common functional domain structure to regulate their activity, including an N-terminal four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM) domain, an SH2-like domain, a pseudokinase domain (also called JAK homology 2, JH2) and a C-terminal kinase catalytic domain (JH1). The association of JAKs with their docking receptors relies on the FERM and SH2-like domains [2,3]. Structure-based analysis of FERM and SH2 domains reveals a conserved mechanism of interaction between JAKs and their cognate receptors [4]. While the JH2 region has been identified as the negative regulator of the JH1 kinase domain [5]. In fact, the JH2 acts as a regulatory domain with functional inhibition of JH1 kinase activity as deletion of JH2 domain enhanced JAK2- and JAK3-mediated signaling [6,7]. Dysregulation of JH2-JH1 interaction results from mutations in JH2 domain is proposed to be associated with tumor progression and immune disorders [8–10]. Upon binding of the ligand to the surface receptor, dimerization of JAK-associating receptor induces the activation of JAK kinase, which in turn recruits and phosphorylates cytosolic STAT proteins and leads to the nuclear translocation of STAT and it function as a transcription factor [11]. The STAT protein family comprises seven members, including STAT1-6, STA5a and STA5b [12]. Activation of STAT by JAK-mediated phosphorylation results in the formation of homo- or heterodimers, and activated STAT is subsequently translocated into the nucleus to control genes harboring the response sequences [12]. Several proinflammatory cytokines within both the autoimmune and tumor microenvironments contribute to the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. The binding of

various type I and II cytokines to specific receptor subunits associated with JAKs, such as type I interferons (IFNs), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-12, and IL-23 [13], leads to the activation of specific downstream intracellular signals, which play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of immune diseases. Importantly, the IL-6-activated JAKs also interact with the other activated cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (or Akt)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways, which indicates that the blockade of the JAK/STAT pathway facilitates the inhibition of several aberrant immune responses by effectively hindering cytokine-mediated signaling pathways.

### 2. Activation of the JAK/STAT pathway and clinical research on JAK inhibitors in autoimmune diseases

Cytokines are crucial for the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases, each of which shows typical cytokine profiles. Effective therapeutic outcomes from targeting the JAK/STAT pathway in type I and type II cytokine signal transduction have been revealed by the rapidly increasing research in the field of rheumatic diseases. The mechanisms of JAK/STAT signaling pathway activation involved in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases are summarized in Fig. 1. Several JAK inhibitors have been approved for various indications, and numerous clinical trials are ongoing (Table 1).

#### 2.1. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

RA is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease characterized by synovial inflammation and joint destruction. Several cytokines play important roles in the pathogenesis of RA, including IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-7, IL-15, IL-12, IL-23, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [14]. Four

oral JAK inhibitors, tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib, and peficitinib, have been approved for the treatment of RA.

Tofacitinib was the first JAK1/JAK2/JAK3 inhibitor, with a higher selectivity for JAK1 and JAK3, approved for the treatment of moderate-severe active RA by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA; November 2012) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA; March 2017). In addition, tofacitinib has also been recommended for second and later lines of treatment for RA by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). The safety issues of tofacitinib for RA, as an oral JAK inhibitor, have been extensively investigated in a series of phase 1–3 trials and serial long-term extension studies [15].

Baricitinib was the second JAK inhibitor targeting JAK1/JAK2 and has been approved for clinical use in RA, first by the EMA (February 2017) and later by the FDA (June 2018) for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe RA with inadequate therapeutic response to or intolerance to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) [16]. The efficacy and safety of baricitinib in RA have been evaluated in several clinical trials and long-term extension studies [17,18].

Upadacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor, was the third JAK inhibitor approved by the FDA (August 2019) and EMA (December 2019) for use to treat moderate to severe RA patients inadequately responding to or intolerant to methotrexate [19]. Filgotinib is another inhibitor with relative selectivity for JAK1 and is approved for RA treatment in the EU and Japan.

Peficitinib is a pan-JAK inhibitor (i.e., it inhibits the enzymatic activity of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2) and was approved in Japan (March 2019) for the treatment of RA [20] based on several phase III clinical trials [21,22].

Other JAK inhibitors, such as decernotinib (a selective JAK3 inhibitor), also show satisfactory effects as a treatment of RA [23,24].

### 2.2. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

SLE is a complicated multiorgan autoimmune disease characterized by aberrant immune responses involving T helper-1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, and regulatory T (Treg) cells as well as elevated proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10 IL-12, IL-17, IFN-γ, IFN-α, and B cell-activating factor (BAFF). The dysregulation of type I and II IFNs and B cells has been demonstrated to be a major component in the pathogenesis of SLE, and the dysregulation of type I and II IFNs provides a rationale for the use of JAK inhibitors in lupus patients. Mechanistically, blockade of JAKs has been demonstrated to decrease CD80/CD86 expression and T cell stimulatory capability through the suppression of type I IFN signaling in human dendritic cells [25]. Accordingly, JAK inhibitors not only suppress the differentiation of plasmablasts and Th1 and Th17 cells but also innate immune responses in the suppression of autoimmune inflammation in SLE.

Evidence from murine lupus models has shown that tofacitinib can effectively decrease the levels of anti-dsDNA and proteinuria, alleviate symptoms of nephritis [26] and improve skin rash [27]. A serial case analysis showed that tofacitinib can rapidly improve the symptoms and signs of arthritis with partial improvement of skin rash in SLE patients, although its effects on serological parameters were limited. The results

of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 24-week phase 2 study of baricitinib in the treatment of SLE showed that baricitinib at a dose of 4 mg/kg significantly improved the signs and symptoms of active SLE patients whose symptoms were not adequately controlled by standard therapy, with a resolution rate as high as 67% in SLEDAI-2K arthritis or rash [28]. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, has also been shown to suppress the development of cutaneous lesions in an MRL/LPR mouse model [29] and abrogate the production of autoantibodies from enriched B cell fractions [30] and cutaneous lupus erythematosus-associated cytokines (CXCL10, CXCL9, and MxA) in SLE patients [31]. Other JAK inhibitors, however, have unsatisfactory results in SLE. For example, a phase 2 trial recruiting patients with active nonrenal SLE revealed an insignificant therapeutic effect of tofacitinib (a JAK1 inhibitor) on the mean expression of IFN transcriptional biomarkers, and it caused severe adverse effects [32,33].

### 2.3. Vasculitis

Vasculitis is an inflammation of blood vessels in which the clinical manifestation varies from general symptoms such as fever to more specific symptoms depending on the body part that is involved. According to the results from preclinical studies, blockade of the JAK/STAT pathway effectively suppresses tissue-resident memory T cells and inhibits core vasculogenic effector pathways in mice with inflamed human arteries [34]. In addition, both the Th17 (IL-6, IL-23) and Th1 (IL-12, IFN-γ) pathways can be modulated by the JAK/STAT pathway [35]. All these results implicate the use of JAK inhibitors in systemic vasculitis.

Although existing data are still very limited, the potential benefit of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of vasculitis may have a significant impact on the management of selected patients, particularly in cases of treatment resistance. For baricitinib, phase 2 studies performed to evaluate its safety and tolerability in polymyalgia rheumatica patients [NCT04027101] and giant cell arteritis [NCT03026504] are ongoing. Another multicenter, randomized controlled phase 3 study is also in progress to evaluate the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in patients with giant cell arteritis [NCT03725202].

### 2.4. Dermatomyositis

Dermatomyositis is a rare and progressively debilitating autoimmune disease involving inflammation of both muscle and skin, leading to muscle weakness and skin rashes in most affected patients. In severe cases, systemic involvement, such as inflammation of the lungs, joints, gut, and heart, can occur and lead to poor prognosis. Traditional medications, including glucocorticoids and DMARDs, only exert limited effectiveness, especially in those who suffer from diseases with systemic involvement. Through analysis of muscle and skin samples obtained from patients with dermatomyositis, inducible transcript and protein levels related to type I IFN signaling were found to be elevated [36,37]. In particular, the IFN1 and IFN2 pathways are differentially activated in different forms of myositis [38].

Tofacitinib has been reported to abrogate the proinflammatory and profibrotic effects of amyopathic dermatomyositis-interstitial lung disease-derived T cells in vitro [39]. In patients with anti-melanoma differentiation-associated 5 gene antibody-positive dermatomyositis along with refractory and continually and rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease, a combination therapy with tofacitinib showed significantly improved survival [40]. Similar results also demonstrated that tofacitinib is effective in improving survival after the onset of ILD and considerably improving lung function, as determined through high-resolution computed tomography [41]. In view of the prior results, a phase 1 trial on the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib in adults with active, treatment-refractory dermatomyositis was initiated [NCT03002649].

**2.5. Other autoimmune diseases**

Several potential applications of JAK inhibitors in miscellaneous autoimmune diseases are ongoing and are summarized in Table 1. Many of them were still under investigation and statistical analysis. For example, primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease with inflammation of exocrine glands leading to sicca symptoms of the affected patients; filgotinib-treated mice exhibited increased salivary flow rates [42] and therefore may be a potential novel therapeutic approach for primary SS. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) causes autoimmune inflammation at connective tissue of the skin and internal organs resulting in fibrosis and vasculopathy. Reports showed that tofacitinib could improve polyarthritis in a patient with SSc [43] and suggested JAK inhibitors may be a therapeutic option for treating arthropathy, scleroderma, and vasculopathy in SSc. The in-progress clinical trials would verify their effectiveness and extend application of the JAK inhibitors for autoimmune diseases.

**3. The effect of JAK/STAT pathway activation on tumor progression**

The great success in the clinical application of JAK inhibitors has led to novel strategies for targeting the JAK/STAT pathway in immune-mediated diseases. The tumor microenvironment is the milieu around a tumor, including the surrounding blood vessels, immune cells, fibroblasts, signaling molecules and the extracellular matrix. A breakthrough treatment strategy using checkpoint inhibitors on immune cells to overcome the insufficiency of traditional chemotherapy implies that immunotherapy has great potential as an effective cancer treatment. The JAK/STAT pathway modulates complicated cytokine signaling pathways as well as the differentiation and activation of immune cells. Therefore, an increasing number of studies have focused on the JAK/STAT pathway in the pathogenesis of various tumors (Fig. 1).

### 3.1. Liquid tumors

The JAK/STAT pathway was originally discovered to involve an intracellular transducer of interferon-responsive genes [44,45] and has also been found to mediate transcriptional programs that control cell growth and differentiation [46,47]. Hematological malignancies such as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), which include polycythaemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), have been reported to ectopically activate the JAK-STAT pathway [48].

Dysregulated JAK/STAT signaling can be attributed to activating mutations in JAK2, particularly single-nucleotide mutations leading to the replacement of valine with phenylalanine at position 617 of the JAK2 protein (V617F) [49]. JAK2 V617F plays a causative role in the development of the PV phenotype in a mouse model [50,51]. In fact, approximately 80% of patients with PV carry the homozygous JAK2V617F mutation, reflecting the role of JAK2 activation in association with the development/progression of this hematological disorder [52].

STAT5 protein serves as the critical adaptor for transducing the signaling mediated by activated JAK2V617F in MPNs [53,54]. In line with the observed JAK2V617F-related phenotype, constitutive activation of STAT5 is associated with the progression of hematologic malignancies, including MPFs [55]. Targeting STAT5 by diminishing its phosphorylation dampens the growth of MPN cells [56], suggesting the therapeutic potential of treating MPNs by disrupting JAK/STAT signaling. In addition, a high frequency of mutations affecting the JAK/STAT pathway has also been reported in plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL), a malignant B-cell lymphoma with a large cell morphology and plasmacytic differentiation [57].

Another aggressive hematological cancer, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), has been reported, and the association of activating mutations in the IL-7R-mediated JAK/STAT pathway with loss of function in polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) leads to a poor response to patients taking prednisone-based therapy [58]. Mutations in the JH2 domain of JAK1 resulting in enhanced kinase activity have been identified in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) [8,59]. Additionally, JH2 mutations (A572 V and A573 V) in JAK3 are found in T-cell malignancies and malignancies of natural killer (NK) cell origin [60,61]. Recently, upregulation of JAK2 signaling and cell cycle progression as well as a high inflammatory response has also been reported in primary cutaneous CD8⁺ aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma (pcAE-CyTCL) [62].

Hyperactive STAT5A-driven massive expansion of CD8 T cells in peripheral T-cell lymphoma has also been reported [63]. The oncogenic role of STAT5B<sup>N642H</sup> in driving natural killer T cell (NKT) transformation to develop CD56⁺ T cell and NK cell lymphomas has been proposed on the basis a mouse model of T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia [64]. Recently, however, in contrast to the development of hematological malignancies, selective expression of JAK2V617F in macrophages has been found to be the result of clonal hematopoiesis, and this expression induces interleukin-1β-dependent inflammation [65], suggesting the inability of amplified JAK signaling in myeloid cells to drive tumorigenesis.

### 3.2. Solid tumors

Similar to the observations in hematological malignancies, point mutations affecting JAK activity have been identified in solid tumors. A proportion of patients with JAK1 mutations show upregulated JAK1 and STAT3 phosphorylation, which allows cell growth independent of cytokine expression in hepatitis B-associated hepatocellular carcinoma [66]. Amplification of the JAK2 gene locus in gastric adenocarcinoma corresponding to an increase in JAK2 transcripts also suggests augmented activity of JAK-dependent pathways [67]. Although rare cancers with activating mutations in the STAT locus have been identified, approximately 40% of patients with large granular lymphocytic leukemia have STAT3 mutations resulting in the stable dimer formation of STAT protein and the amplified expression of its downstream genes [68]. High levels of STAT3 expression predict poor patient prognosis in various types of cancer, including gastric cancer, lung cancer, gliomas, liver cancer, osteosarcoma, and pancreatic cancer [69]. An increase in the copy number of STAT5A/B is associated with the accumulation of nuclear STAT5 in prostate cancer [70]. Activation of STAT3 and STAT5 facilitates tumor progression by regulating the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, inflammation and stemness. Given that cyclin D is the major target gene of STAT3 and STAT5, acetylation of STAT3 by acetyltransferase p300 stabilizes the STAT3-p300 complex together with CD44 to promote their binding to the promoter region of cyclin D, promoting cell cycle progression [71]. Additionally, the STAT3-p300-CD44 complex also regulates genes related to cell survival, such as c-MYC, BCL2, BCL-XL and survivin [72].

The engagement of cytokines or growth factors activates the JAK-STAT pathway and increases the phosphorylation of STAT3, thereby contributing to tumor progression. The common γ chain in cytokine receptors is essential for receiving signals from cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 to regulate the proliferation, activation and differentiation of immune cells. The binding of these cytokines to their cognate receptors with the common γ chain activates JAK1 and JAK3 to transduce downstream pathways [73]. Another group of cytokines consisting of IL-6, IL-11, IL-13, and IL-31 activates downstream signaling partners mainly through JAK1- and JAK2-dependent mechanism, while TYK2 is the critical adaptor for mediating the signaling triggered by IL-10 cytokine family members such as IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26 [74]. IL-6 stimulation induces constitutive activation of STAT3 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [75]. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced JAK2-STAT3

activation is reported to contribute to the growth of ovarian cancer [76].

In contrast with those in other cancer types, genes involved in the inflammatory response constitute major gene sets associated with STAT3 activation in basal-like breast cancers [77]. Cooperation of STAT3 and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) induces IL-6 secretion, supporting tumor survival and clonogenicity [78]. Several proinflammatory molecules in addition to IL-6, such as IL-17, TNF-α and IFN-γ, can also exert biological functions through STAT3 and NF-κB and drive cancer-associated inflammation to promote cancer development [79].

Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are potent protein inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway (Fig. 2). The SOCS family comprises 8 members with immunosuppressive activity, including SOCS1-7 and cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS) [80]. Dysregulated SOCS expression has been implicated not only in tumorigenesis but also in the regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment in a variety of cancers [81]. In fact, in patients with breast cancer, high expression of SOCS3 and SOCS4 is correlated with longer overall survival, while a high level of SOCS2 predicts better recurrence-free survival. These SOCS proteins, particularly SOCS3, have been shown to be involved in the JAK/STAT pathway [82].

Another group of endogenous protein inhibitors that block JAK/STAT signaling is protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS). The PIAS family consists of five members (PIAS1, PIASxα, PIASxβ, PIAS3, and PIASy), and its members are negative regulators of activated STAT proteins [83]. The association of PIAS with STAT blocks the DNA-binding ability of STAT and subsequent downstream STAT-induced gene activation. PIAS also possesses small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase activity and regulates STAT function by altering its subnuclear localization [83]. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the downregulated expression of PIAS3 in various types of lymphoma, lung squamous-cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, and mesothelioma [84]. Low expression of PIAS3 frequently indicates a concomitantly high level of activated STAT3 in malignant cells [85,86]. In contrast, overexpression of PIAS3 significantly impairs STAT3-mediated signaling,

thereby suppressing cancer cell growth in ovarian and endometrial cancer models [87]. Elevated PIAS3 also restores the vulnerability of lung cancer cells to chemotherapy [88].

Multiple regulatory factors facilitate tumor progression by activating or amplifying the JAK/STAT pathway. More recently, circular RNAs (circRNAs), a type of noncoding RNA species, have been demonstrated to upregulate the expression of JAK2 and facilitate the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT3, resulting in the promotion of cell migration and proliferation in colorectal cancer, and the expression of circRNAs is correlated with poor prognosis [89].

### 4. The JAK/STAT pathway in the regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment

The JAK/STAT axis plays critical roles in the development and functionality of immune cells to promote tumor progression (Fig. 2). Lack of JAK or STAT protein function has been linked to immune deficiency phenotypes, as severe combined immune deficiencies (SCIDs) are attributed to disruption of common γ-chain-dependent downstream signaling, which is mediated mainly by JAK and STAT proteins [90]. In fact, loss-of-function mutations in STAT5B are associated with the development of autoimmune diseases due to the altered population of Tregs [91], while deficiency in STAT1 and TYK2 leads to the susceptibility to infections [92]. Impairment to the maturation and IFNγ production in TYK2-knockout NK cells abrogates the tumoricidal cytotoxicity of NK cells [93]. Consistent with this finding, conditional deletion of JAK2 in NK cells leads to the aggravated metastasis of breast cancer cells [94], suggesting that JAK proteins are required for the tumor surveillance by NK cells.

Recent evidence has shown that conditional deletion of the IFNα receptor (IFNAR) in Tregs results in reduced antitumor IFNγ and TNFα production in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which leads to a higher tumor burden phenotype [95]. Furthermore, administration of IFNα attenuates the immunosuppressive functions of Tregs in tumors and enhances antitumor immunity [96]. However, Luckey et al. reported that a decrease in Tregs was observed in a mouse model of SOCS3 overexpression in T cell lineages [97]. In line with this observation, a JAK2-selective inhibitor has also been reported to inhibit the induction of Tregs [98]. Collectively, these findings highlight the critical roles of the JAK-STAT pathway in the regulation of Treg function and imply the requirement of Treg development induced by the effect of JAK-STAT axis-mediated cytokine bioactivity in other T cell subsets.

In cytotoxic T lymphocytes, IFNγ acts as a potent cytokine for the suppression of tumor progression, and receptor-associated JAKs are also critical for transducing IFNγ signaling by selectively recruiting STAT1. Heterodimer formation of STAT1 and STAT4 induces the expression of T-bet, a transcription factor required for Th1 differentiation. As a consequence, additional IFNγ is produced and creates a positive feedback loop. Upon stimulation by CD8 T-secreted IFNγ, phosphorylated STAT1 binds to the promoter of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl2a1 to repress its expression, leading to the suppression of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) function [99]. The proliferation, activation and differentiation of CD8 T cells predominantly rely on IL-2-triggered signaling, and engagement of the IL-2 receptor, which consists of α, β, and γ chains, induces the activation of JAK1 and JAK3 and subsequently results in the phosphorylation of STAT5A and STAT5B [100]. It has been shown that IL-2-derived signals promote memory CD8 T-cell differentiation [101]. Interestingly, tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells display features similar to those of IL-2-induced CD8 memory T cells, and these characteristics are correlated with better tumor control [102]. IL-11, an IL-6 cytokine family, is implicated in cancer progression through its cognate receptor IL11RA, which triggers JAK-STAT signaling. Notably, IL-11 also impairs CD4 T-mediated antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment in a mouse model of colon cancer [103].

**5. Targeting the JAK/STAT pathway in cancer treatment**

The JAK/STAT signaling loop plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and shapes the tumor immune microenvironment, which provides a rationale for targeting these pathways in cancer treatment. Ruxolitinib, a selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, alleviates the disease progression of MPN patients [104], and its effectiveness directly depends on the proinflammatory cytokines activated by JAK1 and JAK2 [105]. Ruxolitinib exposure also leads to a decrease in cytokine-induced NK function and dendritic cell (DC) activation [106, 107] and the T-cell population, as evidenced by reduced Tregs and increased Th17 cells in ruxolitinib-treated MPN patients [108]. Noticeably, ruxolitinib-treated MPN patients may have a higher risk of developing aggressive B-cell lymphoma [109], although other studies have reported contradictory results [110, 111].

Another FDA-approved small molecule targeting the JAK/STAT pathway for treating primary or secondary myelofibrosis is fedratinib. Fedratinib displays high specific affinity for JAK2 and suppresses NF-κB-mediated proinflammatory cytokine production to mitigate MPN pathology [112]. Nevertheless, the effects of fedratinib on immune cell populations are unclear. Although fedratinib blocks the IL-2-and soluble IL-15-induced downstream activation of STAT5 in NK cells, the signals from membrane-bound IL-15 transduced *in trans* by DCs are not affected, attenuating the functional impairment of NK cells [113]. Notably, SOCS2 deficiency causes fedratinib-induced suppression of NK development, but the mechanism is unknown [114]. Furthermore, fedratinib treatment impairs IL-6 and TNFα production as well as the expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions but does not interfere with Treg numbers [115]. Current treatments and ongoing trials targeting JAKs are summarized in Table 2.

**6. Conclusion and prospects**

Knowledge of JAK/STAT signaling pathways and the use of JAK inhibitors have led to remarkable advances in the treatment of many immune-mediated diseases in the past decade. The advantage of rapid onset as well as the comparable effect to biological agents in an oral formulation makes the use of JAK inhibitors attractive for more indications. The potent suppression of autoimmune inflammation, as well as the potential antitumor effects of these agents, sheds light on the potential efficacy of JAK inhibitors as promising novel alternatives for treating intractable autoimmune diseases and rare oncologic malignancies. However, the accumulating data on the safety profiles of JAK inhibitors have also shown an increased risk of certain types of infection, most notably viral diseases such as herpes zoster. In addition, JAK inhibitors are less selective than monoclonal antibodies and simultaneously block the signaling of multiple cytokine axes. Hence, although small molecules may be less immunogenic than biological agents, their clinical efficacy and safety results may differ from those of clinical trials. Long-term clinical data need to be acquired to balance the efficacy and toxicity of candidate JAK inhibitors used in autoimmune disease and cancer therapy.
