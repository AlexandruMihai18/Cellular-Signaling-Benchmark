ABSTRACT

Impaired adipogenic differentiation during diet-induced obesity (DIO) promotes adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation, thereby contributing to metabolic disease. Adenomatosis polyposis coli downregulated 1 (APCDD1) has recently been identified as an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, a key regulator of adipogenic differentiation. Here, we report a novel role for APCDD1 in adipogenic differentiation via repression of Wnt signaling, and an epigenetic linkage between miR-130 and APCDD1 in DIO. APCDD1 expression was significantly upregulated in mature adipocytes as compared to undifferentiated preadipocytes in both human and mouse subcutaneous adipose tissues. siRNA-based silencing of APCDD1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes markedly increased expression of Wnt signaling proteins (Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt10b, LRP5, β-catenin), and inhibited expression of adipocyte differentiation markers (C/EBPα, PPARγ and lipid droplet accumulation, while adenovirus-mediated overexpression of APCDD1 enhanced adipogenic differentiation. Notably, DIO mice exhibited reduced APCDD1 expression and increased

Wnt expression in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues and impaired adipogenic differentiation in vitro. Mechanistically, we found that miR-130, whose expression is upregulated in adipose tissues of DIO mice, could directly target the 3'-untranslated region of the APCDD1 gene. Furthermore, transfection of a miR-130 inhibitor in preadipocytes enhanced, while a miR-130 mimic blunted, adipogenic differentiation, suggesting that miR-130 contributes to impaired adipogenic differentiation during DIO by repressing APCDD1 expression. Finally, human subcutaneous adipose tissues isolated from obese individuals exhibited reduced expression of APCDD1, C/EBPα and PPARγ as compared to those from non-obese subjects. Taken together, these novel findings suggest that APCDD1 positively regulates adipogenic differentiation, and that its downregulation by miR-130 during DIO may contribute to impaired adipogenic differentiation and obesity-related metabolic disease.

INTRODUCTION

Adipose tissue is the major energy reserve in

higher eukaryotes and is remarkably flexible at storing
and releasing triacylglycerols during periods of caloric
excess and deprivation. Adipose tissue can expand by
increasing the volume of preexisting adipocytes
(hypertrophy) and/or by increasing the number of new
adipocytes (hyperplasia) via adipogenic differentiation
of partially committed stem cells, termed
preadipocytes (1). Adipogenic differentiation of
preadipocytes is a normal physiological function
required for adipose tissue development and
remodeling. However, in obesity, adipogenic
differentiation is typically insufficient to meet
metabolic demand, and the excess calories are
primarily stored in preexisting adipocytes, which
become overloaded with lipid. The resulting
mechanical stress leads to adipose tissue inflammation,
glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and ectopic
lipid accumulation (2, 3). Studies in humans suggest
that adipocyte cell size is an independent predictor of
the development of obesity-related metabolic disease
(4). Thus, understanding the mechanisms that regulate
adipogenic differentiation during obesity may provide
important insights into the pathogenesis and treatment
of metabolic disease.

The Wnt signaling pathway is a fundamental
regulator of cell proliferation, polarization, and
differentiation (5, 6). Wnt family proteins exert their
effects on cellular processes through canonical and
non-canonical pathways (7, 8). The canonical Wnt/β-
catenin pathway is activated by binding of Wnt ligands
to Frizzled (Fz) receptors and co-receptors, low
density lipoprotein-related protein (LRP) 5/6, leading
to β-catenin stabilization and subsequent translocation
into the nucleus, where it affects the transcription of
Wnt target genes (9-11). Wnt signaling has been
reported to negatively regulate adipogenic
differentiation through several mechanisms; for
example, Wnt6, Wnt10a and Wnt10b inhibit
adipogenic differentiation through a β-catenin
dependent mechanism (12), and Wnt3a suppresses
C/EBPβ/δ-induced adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells by
inhibiting PPARγ induction (13). Thus, regulation of
Wnt signaling in obesity may impact the development
and/or progression of metabolic disease.

Recently, adenomatosis polyposis coli down-
regulated 1 (APCDD1), a membrane bound protein
expressed during tissue development, has been
identified as a novel Wnt inhibitor (14). Mechanistically, APCDD1 was reported to physically
interact with canonical Wnt3a ligand and LRP 5
receptor at the cell surface, thereby repressing the

biological effects of Wnt signaling and contributing to
neural development in chicks and in Xenopus
embryos. APCDD1 is widely expressed in adult
human tissues, including the heart, pancreas, prostate,
hair follicles, liver, kidney, and adipose tissues (14-
16), but the biological functions of APCDD1 are
poorly understood. Previously, using an unbiased
genome-wide microarray approach, we observed that
APCDD1 expression was significantly higher in well-
differentiated subcutaneous adipocytes as compared to
poorly differentiated visceral (perivascular) adipocytes
isolated from the same human subjects (17),
suggesting the possibility that APCDD1 could play a
role in adipogenic differentiation, perhaps through its
ability to inhibit Wnt signaling.

In this study, we investigated the role of
APCDD1 in regulating differentiation of human and
mouse preadipocytes. We provide evidence that
downregulation of endogenous APCDD1 expression
increases the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,
leading to the inhibition of key adipogenic
transcription factors (C/EBPα, PPARγ) and impaired
adipogenic differentiation. Conversely, overexpression
of APCDD1 promotes adipogenic differentiation. We
also report that APCDD1 expression in adipose tissue
is decreased under obese conditions in both mouse and
human subjects as compared to non-obese controls.
Furthermore, microRNA (miR)-130 was identified as a
posttranscriptional regulator of APCDD1 gene
expression during DIO. These findings may have
important implications for the role of APCDD1 in the
pathogenesis of obesity-related metabolic disease.

RESULTS

Increased APCDD1 expression in conjunction
with decreased Wnt signaling during adipogenic
differentiation - Wnt expression was reported to be
downregulated during differentiation of murine
preadipocytes (18). To confirm that Wnt expression is
downregulated during in vitro adipogenic
differentiation of human preadipocytes, we assayed the
mRNA expression of Wnt1, Wnt3a, Wnt10b. All three
genes were significantly downregulated at 6 days after
induction of differentiation as compared to
undifferentiated cells (Fig. 1A). Next, to examine
whether APCDD1 is differentially expressed in mature
adipocytes (AD) versus undifferentiated preadipocytes
(PA), we fractionated human subcutaneous adipose
tissues to obtain floating mature adipocytes and the
stromal vascular fraction, which is enriched in
preadipocytes. Interestingly, APCDD1 mRNA levels
were markedly higher in mature human adipocytes as compared to the stromal vascular fraction (Fig. 1B). In addition, APCDD1 mRNA expression was significantly increased during in vitro differentiation of human subcutaneous preadipocytes (Fig. 1C). Time course experiments in mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes demonstrated that APCDD1 mRNA expression is rapidly induced following the onset of adipogenic differentiation, with levels peaking by day 3 and sustained for up to 12 days (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, APCDD1 protein expression was markedly upregulated during adipogenic differentiation in isolated murine adipocytes (Fig. 1E) and in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Fig. 1F & S1) as compared to undifferentiated cells. Thus, Wnt expression is downregulated during adipogenic differentiation in conjunction with increased APCDD1 expression in both humans and mice.

APCDD1 gene silencing attenuates adipogenic differentiation in conjunction with increased Wnt signaling - To investigate whether APCDD1 expression participates in adipogenic differentiation, we silenced APCDD1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by transfecting with siRNA specific for APCDD1 or a scrambled control. Knockdown of APCDD1 blunted adipogenic differentiation, as demonstrated by reduced lipid droplet accumulation (Fig. 2A) and adipogenic markers (C/EBPα, PPARγ) expression (Fig. 2B&C). Furthermore, APCDD1 gene silencing increased the expression of proteins associated with Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, including Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt10b, LRP5, and β-catenin, in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Fig. 2B&C). These data indicate that knockdown of APCDD1 blocks adipogenic differentiation while upregulating Wnt signaling.

Overexpression of APCDD1 enhances adipogenic differentiation and inhibits Wnt signaling - To establish APCDD1 as a positive regulator of adipogenic differentiation, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transduced with adenovirus overexpressing APCDD1 or GFP control. At 7 days of adipogenic differentiation, APCDD1-overexpressing cells exhibited increased lipid droplet accumulation (Fig. 3A) and adipogenic markers (adiponectin, FABP4, C/EBPα, PPARγ) expression (Fig. 3B&C) as compared to GFP control-transduced cells. Moreover, expression of Wnt signaling proteins, including Wnt3a, Wnt5a, LRP5, and β-catenin, was attenuated in APCDD1-overexpressing cells as compared to control. These findings suggest that APCDD1 positively

Role of APCDD1 in adipogenic differentiation regulates adipogenic differentiation while suppressing the Wnt signaling pathway. Reduced APCDD1 expression in parallel with impaired adipocyte differentiation in obese mice - To investigate the potential role of APCDD1 in DIO in vivo, we quantified APCDD1 expression in the subcutaneous adipose tissues of lean chow diet (CD) fed mice and obese high-fat diet (HFD) mice. Body weight was significantly increased by HFD feeding (60% calories from lard fat) in WT (C57Bl/6) mice (Fig. 4A). Intriguingly, after 18 weeks of HFD feeding, APCDD1 mRNA and protein expression were reduced in subcutaneous adipose tissues (SQ) as compared to CD mice (Fig. 4B&C). Similarly, APCDD1 protein expression was also significantly decreased in HFD mice-derived visceral adipose tissues (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, Wnt3a protein expression was increased in adipose tissues isolated from HFD mice. Importantly, as we reported previously (19), preadipocytes isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue of HFD male mice demonstrated impaired in vitro differentiation as compared to that from CD mice, as evidenced by diminished lipid droplet accumulation (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that impaired adipogenic differentiation during HFD is associated with reduced APCDD1 expression.

miR-130 overexpression induced by HFD directly targets APCDD1 gene expression - Next, we investigated the potential mechanisms whereby APCDD1 expression is downregulated during DIO. We hypothesized that a specific set of miRNAs may be induced by HFD to regulate APCDD1 expression in preadipocytes. To test this hypothesis, we first examined databases (TargetScan, miRWalk, PicTar) to search for miRNAs potentially targeting APCDD1, which predicted that miRNA-130a-3p and miRNA-130b-3p directly bind to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of APCDD1 mRNA (Fig. 5A). We quantified expression of miR-130a-3p and miR-130b-3p in 3T3-L1 cells and observed that both of these miRNAs were downregulated within 1 day after induction of differentiation and remained repressed for up to 12 days (Fig. 5B & S2). To experimentally validate that APCDD1 is a target gene of miR-130, expression of miR-130a-3p and miR-130b-3p was knocked down by specific antisense inhibitors. Transfection of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with anti-miR-130a-3p or anti-miR-130b-3p significantly augmented APCDD1 protein expression (Fig. 5C), indicating that APCDD1 is a direct target of miR-130. To investigate whether miR-
3
130 is induced by HFD, we examined the expression levels of miR-130 in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues. Interestingly, expression of miR-130a-3p and miR-130b-3p was markedly increased in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues from HFD mice as compared to control mice (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, transfection of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with miR-130a-3p inhibitor enhanced, while overexpression of miR-130a-3p blunted, adipogenic differentiation as evaluated by cytoplasmic lipid droplet measurement (Fig 5D-F).

MiR-130 could potentially inhibit adipogenic differentiation by targeting genes other than APCDD1. Thus, we tested the effects of forced overexpression of APCDD1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes transfected with miR-130a-3p mimic. As shown in Fig. S3, the miR-130a-3p mimic failed to inhibit adipogenic differentiation in APCDD-1-overexpressing cells. These findings support a mechanistic link between miR-130 and APCDD1 in the inhibition of adipogenic differentiation. Moreover, our results are consistent with the notion that HFD-induced miR-130 targets APCDD1 in DIO mice to impair adipogenic differentiation.

APCDD1 expression is downregulated in obese individuals in conjunction with reduced adipogenic gene expression - To investigate the functional relevance of APCDD1 in human obesity, we examined APCDD1 expression in subcutaneous adipose tissues isolated from obese (BMI > 30) and non-obese (BMI < 30) human subjects. Interestingly, APCDD1 protein expression was significantly downregulated in obese as compared to non-obese subjects. Furthermore, adipogenic markers (C/EBPα, PPARγ) protein expression was markedly reduced in obese subjects (Fig. 6A&B). There was also a strong trend towards decreased adiponectin gene expression with increasing BMI in our patient population (Fig. S4). Notably, expression of Wnt3a, one of the targets of APCDD1, tended to be upregulated in adipose tissues isolated from obese subjects (p = 0.06 vs non-obese control). MiR-130 expression in human subcutaneous adipose tissues exhibited considerable variability but showed a trend towards an increase in obese individuals (Fig. S5). These findings in human adipose tissues support our data obtained from mice as well as in vitro cell culture experiments in that impaired adipogenic differentiation during DIO could potentially be linked to reduced APCDD1 expression.

DISCUSSION

The Wnt signaling pathway negatively regulates adipogenic differentiation and may play an important role in promoting metabolic dysfunction in obesity. Here, we report that APCDD1 is a positive regulator of adipogenic differentiation through its repression of Wnt signaling. APCDD1 is weakly expressed in subcutaneous adipose tissues isolated from obese mice and humans, consistent with reports of impaired adipocyte differentiation in DIO. Moreover, overexpression of APCDD1 in 3T3-LI cells enhances adipogenic differentiation and inhibits expression of proteins in the Wnt signaling pathway, while siRNA-mediated APCDD1 gene silencing blunts adipogenic differentiation and upregulates Wnt protein expression. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that APCDD1 is directly targeted by miR-130, which is overexpressed in adipose tissues of obese mice. Taken together, these findings uncover a novel role for APCDD1 in adipogenic differentiation and raise the possibility that suppression of APCDD1 expression by miR-130 in adipose tissues contributes to obesity-related metabolic disease.

Wnt signaling has been reported to repress adipogenic differentiation by blocking the induction of key adipogenic transcription factors, PPARγ and C/EBPα (18, 20). Wnts are secreted, cysteine-rich glycoproteins that act as autocrine or paracrine factors regulating a variety of developmental processes including cell proliferation and differentiation (5, 21). Wnt signaling encompasses both canonical and non-canonical pathways, with the former being better characterized in adipogenic differentiation. Pioneering studies demonstrated that overexpression of Wnt1 or a GSK3β phosphorylation-defective β-catenin mutant inhibited adipogenic differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (18). Overexpression of canonical Wnt10b ligand stabilized β-catenin and blocked adipogenic differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (18). Also, transgenic mice overexpressing Wnt10b under the control of the adipose-specific FABP4 promoter exhibited a 50% reduction in total body adiposity and resistance to HFD-induced white adipose tissue expansion (22). While the canonical Wnt pathway has been consistently implicated to inhibit adipogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo, non-canonical Wnt pathways (independent of β-catenin) are poorly understood and may exert opposing effects on adipogenesis. For instance, Wnt5b, a non-canonical ligand, is transiently induced during adipogenic differentiation and partially inhibits the canonical

Wnt/β-catenin pathway to facilitate differentiation (23). Thus, the canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways are interconnected and crosstalk with one another to regulate adipogenic differentiation in a complex manner.

The components of Wnt signaling pathways are modulated by a number of endogenous activators and inhibitors, among them APCDD1 (24). APCDD1 is an evolutionarily conserved plasma membrane glycoprotein that has only been recently identified as a Wnt inhibitor (14). The APCDD1 gene is located on chromosome 18 in mice and humans and was first identified in colon cancer tissues (14, 16, 25). It encodes a ~58 kDa transmembrane protein whose transcription is regulated by β-catenin/Tcf complex (14, 16). APCDD1 expression was found to be elevated in 18 of 27 primary colon cancer tissues compared with corresponding noncancerous mucosae, and its exogenous expression was shown to promote cancer cell growth (16). In humans, APCDD1 is expressed during tissue development and in numerous adult tissue types (14-16), suggesting a diverse role for APCDD1 in biological processes associated with Wnt signaling. Indeed, recent studies have documented that APCDD1 is involved in gliogenesis, tooth morphogenesis, oligodendrocyte differentiation, osteogenic differentiation of human dental follicle cells, and diseases such as hereditary hypotrichosis simplex (14, 26-29). While most studies support an inhibitory role for APCDD1 in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, Morsczeck reported that APCDD1 sustained the expression and activation of β-catenin during osteogenic differentiation of human dental follicle cells (28). Moreover, microarray results indicated that APCDD1 expression is >300 fold higher in dental follicle cells than in mesenchymal stem cells (30). This suggests that the level of APCDD1 expression, and its impact on Wnt/β-catenin signaling, may vary considerably in individual cells and tissues.

Although a role for APCDD1 in mammalian adipose development and adipocyte differentiation is hitherto unreported, Ullah et al recently identified APCDD1 as a potential human adipocyte-specific marker gene using GeneChips analysis and bioinformatics (15). Our study is the first to directly examine the functional significance of APCDD1 in adipogenic differentiation and propose a functional link between APCDD1 and the adipogenic program through a Wnt

signaling-dependent mechanism. APCDD1 was demonstrated to physically interact with Wnt3a and Fz co-receptor LRP5 proteins, thereby preventing the formation of Wnt receptor complexes (14). Here, we showed that APCDD1 inhibits the expression of Wnt pathway-related proteins including Wnt3a, LRP5, and β-catenin in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, revealing a mechanism by which APCDD1 could disrupt canonical Wnt signaling. In addition to canonical Wnt signaling, we found that APCDD1 may also regulate the expression of non-canonical Wnt5a. The precise mechanisms whereby APCDD1 inhibits Wnt pathways in the context of adipogenic differentiation thus appear to be complex. Also, it is also possible that APCDD1 regulates adipocyte differentiation via Wnt-independent mechanisms. Future studies will be required to investigate these possibilities.

Although adipose tissue contains a large number of preadipocytes that are potentially able to differentiate into fully mature, lipid-storing adipocytes, it nevertheless primarily expands primarily by enlargement of pre-existing adipocytes in obesity (31, 32), thus promoting insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, key aspects of metabolic syndrome (3, 33). This suggests that the level of adipogenic differentiation is insufficient to match the metabolic demand in obesity. The rate of preadipocyte replication is actually increased in adipose tissues of obese mice (34), suggesting that the insufficient level of adipocyte differentiation in obesity is not caused by reduced adipogenic precursor cell abundance. Interestingly, we have previously reported that HFD impairs adipogenic differentiation, promoting accumulation of inefficiently differentiated adipocytes that exhibit diminished expression of adipogenic differentiation-specific genes (35). This impairment in adipogenic differentiation in HFD-induced obesity therefore may be related to the inability of preadipocytes to efficiently undergo differentiation and/or maintain the differentiated state.

Mounting evidence indicates that Wnt signaling may be dysregulated in obesity, and thus could potentially contribute to the impaired adipogenic differentiation. Two independent groups have reported increased circulating Wnt5a in obese patients compared to lean control subjects (36, 37). Expression of Wnt5a mRNA in visceral adipose tissues was also found to be increased, while secreted Fz-related protein 5 (SFRP5), an adipokine that represses Wnt signaling by binding and sequestering Wnt ligands, was reduced in obese patients (37). In line with these

findings, we showed that obese subjects (BMI>30) 
tended to display increased Wnt3a expression in their 
subcutaneous adipose tissues as compared to non-
obese 
subjects 
(BMI<30). The 
mechanisms 
responsible for upregulated Wnt ligand expression in 
obesity are unknown. Interestingly, we observed 
decreased APCDD1 protein expression in both obese 
human and mouse adipose tissues as compared to their 
corresponding controls. Based on our findings, we 
postulate that reduced APCDD1 expression in obese 
adipose tissues may potentiate Wnt signaling, thereby 
contributing to impaired adipogenic differentiation in 
vivo. Future studies directly targeting APCDD1 in 
animal models of obesity will be required to test this 
hypothesis.

Identifying the mechanisms whereby APCDD1 
expression is downregulated in obese adipose tissues 
may provide insights into the pathogenesis of 
metabolic syndrome and new approaches for 
treatment. Here, we focused on epigenetic mechanisms 
of gene regulation, which play a prominent role in the 
pathogenesis of obesity-related diabetes (38). In 
particular, miRNAs, through their potent effects on 
posttranscriptional 
regulation, are functionally 
important in adipogenic differentiation. For instance, 
miR-143 stimulates adipogenic differentiation through 
inhibition of ERK5 (39), while miR-210 enhances 
adipogenesis by inhibiting TCF7L2, a key 
transcription factor in Wnt signaling (40). Moreover, 
miR-124 and miR-17-92 promote adipogenic 
differentiation by repressing Dlx5 and RB family 
Rb2/p130, respectively (41, 42). On the other hand, 
several miRNAs have been reported to negatively 
regulate adipogenesis. TNF-α-induced upregulation of 
miR-155 inhibits adipogenic differentiation by 
downregulating CREB and C/EBPβ (43), and let-7 
was reported to inhibit adipogenesis by regulating the 
expression of high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA-
2) (44). Notably, the miR-130 family has been shown 
to impair human preadipocyte differentiation by 
repressing PPARγ biosynthesis, and TNF-α-induced 
miR-130 was reported to promote adipocyte 
dysfunction during obesity (45, 46). Here, we 
confirmed a previous report that miR-130 expression 
is upregulated in adipose tissues of HFD-fed obese 
mice (46). Computational analysis of the 3'-UTR of 
the APCDD1 gene predicted a binding site for miR-
130a and miR-130b, which share the same seed 
sequence but are encoded by two independent loci 
(miRBase Database). Knockdown of miR-130 in 
preadipocytes 
increased 

Role of APCDD1 in adipogenic differentiation

suggesting that it may directly target APCDD1. 
Indeed, transfection of a miR-130a-3p inhibitor in 
preadipocytes enhanced, while a miR-130a-3p mimic 
blunted, adipogenic differentiation. Based on these 
findings, we hypothesize that elevated miR-130 in 
obese adipose tissues may contribute to impaired 
adipogenic differentiation via its inhibitory effect on 
APCDD1 expression (Fig.7). While this study focused 
on the role of miRNA, the importance of other 
epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation 
and histone modifications, in regulating APCDD1 
gene expression in obesity remains to be determined. 
Finally, what role, if any, that adipocyte enlargement 
in obesity plays in downregulating APCDD1 
expression also remains to be determined.

In conclusion, we provide novel evidence that 
APCDD1, an endogenous inhibitor of Wnt signaling, 
is an essential component of the adipogenic 
differentiation program. Based on our findings, we 
propose a working model (Fig.7A&B) to suggest that, 
under normal physiological conditions, APCDD1 
inhibits the expression of Wnt signaling proteins 
leading to the induction of key adipogenic 
transcription factors (C/EBPα, PPARγ) and induction 
of adipogenic differentiation. In DIO, upregulated 
expression of miR-130 in adipose tissues blocks 
APCDD1 gene expression, thereby augmenting Wnt 
signaling and repressing adipogenic differentiation. 
These findings may have important implications for 
the pathogenesis of obesity-related metabolic disease.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Preparation of mouse adipose tissues - Male 
C57BL/6J mice were maintained on chow diet after 
weaning. At 6 weeks of their age, these mice were 
either maintained on chow diet (CD, Harlan Teklad, 
LM-485) or switched to HFD (Research Diet, D12492, 
with 60% calories from lard fat) for 18 weeks. Mice 
were euthanized, blood collected via cardiocentesis, 
and subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues were 
collected following tissue perfusion with saline. All 
animal studies were conducted using a protocol 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee of University of Cincinnati College of 
Medicine and Medical College of Georgia at Augusta 
University.

Preparation of human adipose tissues - Human 
adipose tissues were collected from obese (BMI>30) 
and non-obese (BMI<30) patients undergoing 
abdominal surgeries. The study protocol was approved 
by the Institutional Review Boards of University of 

Cincinnati and Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.

**Isolation of adipocytes, preadipocytes, and in vitro adipogenic differentiation**  
To isolate adipocytes and preadipocytes from adipose tissues, mouse or human adipose tissues were thoroughly minced, digested with collagenase (Worthington), filtered, and centrifuged to separate mature floating adipocytes from the pelleted stromal vascular fraction (SV) cells (preadipocyte-enriched) as previously described (47). Then, SV pellets were resuspended, plated, and grown in preadipocyte growth medium (Cell Applications, CA) as previously described (47). The cells were expanded for two to four passages in culture and differentiated in the presence of adipocyte differentiation medium (Cell Applications, CA), which was replaced with fresh medium every two days. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes medium and differentiated in 3T3-L1 differentiation medium (Zenbio, NC). These commercial media include a standard combination of adipogenic differentiation factors, including FBS (5-10%), insulin (100 - 1,700 nM), dexamethasone (250 - 1,000 nM) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, 100-500 nM), indomethacin, biotin, pantothenate, etc., and induce adipogenic differentiation with high efficiencies. For molecular studies, adipose tissues were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection for subsequent analysis of RNA or protein expression. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, obtained from ATCC, were grown in preadipocyte medium (ZenBio) and differentiated in the presence of adipocyte differentiation medium (ZenBio) according to manufacturer's instructions.

**Cytoplasmic Lipid Droplet Measurement by Oil red O**  
0.4% of Oil red O (Sigma) in isopropanol (stock solution) was diluted at 3:2 (Oil red O: ddH₂O) ratio to form Oil red O working solution. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. Cells were then washed with ddH₂O followed by 60% isopropanol. Oil red O working solution was then added to the fixed cells and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After incubation, cells were washed with ddH₂O and imaged using light microscopy. Oil red O quantification was carried out by measuring OD (510 nm) with a spectrophotometer.

**siRNA transfection of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes**  
3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with APCDD1-specific siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, final concentration: 20 nM) or scramble control by

using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen) per manufacturer’s instructions, after which the cells were differentiated in the presence of adipocyte differentiation medium. After 72 h of differentiation, the cells were re-transfected with APCDD1 siRNA or scramble control in the same manner to boost transfection efficiency. At 7 days of differentiation, cells were stained with Oil red O to evaluate lipid accumulation (an index of adipocyte differentiation) or harvested for molecular studies.

**Adenovirus transduction of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes**  
Human APCDD1 adenovirus (Applied Biological Materials) was amplified by transducing HEK 293 cells, and the medium supernatant containing adenovirus was collected and titrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transduced with adenoviruses carrying APCDD1 or a control gene at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 500 with 0.5 μg/ml poly-L-lysine in preadipocyte medium for 6 h, and then differentiated in the presence of adipocyte differentiation medium. At 7 days of differentiation, cells were stained with Oil red O or harvested for molecular studies.

**Quantitative PCR**  
Total RNA was extracted from tissues or cells with QIAzol Lysis Reagent, and purified with RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) per manufacturer’s instructions. Real time quantification of mRNA levels of the genes of interest was performed using Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Agilent Technologies) per manufacturer’s instructions. Normalized Ct values were subjected to statistical analysis and fold difference was calculated by ΔΔCt method as described previously (48).

**Western Blot**  
Proteins were extracted from tissues or cells by RIPA lysis buffer, and then separated on SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, probed with the appropriate antibodies, and subsequently blots were developed using ECL system (Thermo Scientific). For detection of nuclear proteins (β-catenin, C/EBPα and PPARγ), nuclear fractionation was performed using an NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Levels of mRNA and protein expressions were determined by qPCR and Western blot, respectively.

Figure 2. APCDD1 gene silencing suppresses adipogenic differentiation in conjunction with upregulated expression of Wnt signaling proteins in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. (A) Adipogenic differentiation was impaired in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes transfected with APCDD1 siRNA as compared to scrambled control, as indicated by reduced cytoplasmic lipid droplet accumulation (Oil red O). *p<0.0001 vs control (scramble). (B, C) Transfection of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with APCDD1 siRNA increased expression of Wnt signaling proteins (Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt10b, LRP5 and β-catenin) and decreased expression of adipogenic markers (C/EBPα and PPARγ) (n=3). β-catenin, C/EBPα and PPARγ expression levels were examined in nuclear fraction. *p<0.01, **p<0.05 vs control. Protein expressions were determined by Western blot and densitometry analysis.

Figure 3. APCDD1 overexpression accelerates adipogenic differentiation and downregulates the expression of Wnt signaling proteins in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. (A) Adipogenic differentiation [as indicated by lipid droplet accumulation (Oil red O)] was increased in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes transfected with adenoviral APCDD1 as compared to control. *p<0.01 vs control (Adeno-GFP). (B) mRNA expression of adipogenic markers (adiponectin and FABP4) was upregulated in adenoviral APCDD1-transduced 3T3-L1 preadipocytes during differentiation (7 days) (n=4). *p<0.01 vs control (PA), **p<0.05 vs GFP. (C, D) Transduction of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with adenoviral APCDD1 downregulated Wnt-associated protein expression (Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt10b, LRP5 and β-catenin) and upregulated adipogenic marker (C/EBPα and PPARγ) protein expression during differentiation (n=3). *p<0.01, **p<0.05 vs control. Levels of mRNA and protein expressions were determined by qPCR and Western blot, respectively. Representative blots are shown in C, and densitometry in D.

Figure 4. Reduced APCDD1 expression is associated with upregulated Wnt3a and blunted adipogenic differentiation in DIO mice. (A) 18 weeks of HFD feeding, as compared to chow diet (CD) feeding, significantly increased body weight in mice (n=3). (B-D) APCDD1 mRNA (B) and protein (C) levels were downregulated, while Wnt3a was upregulated, in extracts of subcutaneous (SQ) and visceral (D) adipose tissues isolated from HFD-fed DIO mice compared with lean controls (n=3). Relative mRNA and protein expression were quantified by qPCR and Western blot, respectively. *p<0.01, **p<0.05 vs control (CD). (E) Adipogenic differentiation (7 days) was impaired in preadipocytes isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissues

of DIO mice. Light microscopy of neutral cytoplasmic lipid droplet accumulation was assessed by Oil red O staining.

Figure 5. HFD-induced miR-130 targets APCDD1 and inhibits adipogenic differentiation. (A) Computational analysis predicted that miR-130a-3p and miR-130b-3p can directly bind 3'-UTR of APCDD1. (B) miR-130a-3p and miR103b-3p levels were downregulated during adipogenic differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. *p<0.05 vs control (Day 0). (C) APCDD1 protein expression was increased by transfection of miR-130 inhibitor in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (n=3). *p<0.05 vs control (scramble). (D) miR-130a-3p and miR-130b-3p levels were increased in the subcutaneous (SQ) and visceral adipose depots of HFD-fed DIO mice (n=5). *p<0.01, **p<0.05 vs control (CD), (E) miR-130a-3p expression was significantly reduced or increased by transfection of miR-130a-3p inhibitor or mimic, respectively, in 3T3-L1 preadiopocytes (n=3). *p<0.01 vs control. (F) Adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was enhanced by transfection of miR-130a-3p inhibitor and reduced by transfection of miR-130a-3p mimic. *p<0.0001 vs control. Light microscopy of neutral cytoplasmic lipid droplets accumulation was evaluated by Oil red O staining and OD measurement by spectrophotometer.

Figure 6. Downregulated expression of APCDD1 in adipose tissues from obese humans is associated with reduced adipogenic gene expression. Protein expression of APCDD1, in conjunction with C/EBPα, PPARγ, was downregulated, while Wnt3a levels tended to be upregulated (p=0.06), in subcutaneous adipose tissues isolated from obese (BMI>30) as compared to non-obese subjects (BMI<30). *p<0.05 vs non-obese control. Protein expressions were analyzed by Western blot (A, representative data) and densitometry (B, n=8).

Figure 7. Schematic model depicting the potential mechanisms of APCDD1-mediated adipogenic differentiation in lean state versus DIO. Under normal physiological conditions, APCDD1 inhibits the expression of Wnt signaling proteins, leading to the induction of key adipogenic transcription factors (C/EBPα, PPARγ) and adipogenic differentiation. In DIO, HFD-induced miR-130 in adipose tissues blocks APCDD1 gene expression, thereby augmenting Wnt signaling and repressing adipogenic differentiation.
