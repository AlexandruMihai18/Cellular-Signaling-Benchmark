# Pathophysiology of Cardiac Inflammation: Molecular Mechanisms

Sabine Pankuweit, Irene Portig, Bernhard Maisch¹

## Background:
Inflammatory processes induced by viral infection are believed to be one of the major pathogenetic mechanisms in inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy. Although the reason for progression to myocardial failure is not fully understood, postulated mechanisms include persistent viral infection alone or in combination with autoimmune processes.

## Pathophysiology:
Murine models of myocarditis have provided insight into the mechanisms by which autoimmune responses to cardiac antigens, probably in response to viral infection of the myocardium, arise and cause tissue pathology. Organ-specificity, cross-reactivity between microbial agents and cardiac tissue, and induction of tolerance to self-antigen are issues still at stake. In addition, cytokines mediate activation and effector phase of innate and specific immunity, which are both important in controlling viral infection. The innate immune response not only has an important protective function but also serves to initiate and regulate subsequent specific immune responses. In man, on the one hand specific T cells and antibodies against different cardiac tissue components have been demonstrated in myocardium and sera of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy, and on the other hand viral genome has been identified in endomyocardial biopsies due to the rapid development of new molecular biological techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), southern blot analysis and in-situ hybridization. But it is still a matter of debate whether virus infection itself, the ensuing immune response, or both, contribute to the deterioration of left ventricular function.

## Conclusion:
Taking these mechanisms into account, screening for viral genome by PCR and detection of inflammatory infiltrates by immunohistochemistry are considered crucial for the establishment of a definite diagnosis thereby allowing for the initiation of specific therapeutic strategies.

# Pathophysiologie der kardialen Entzündung: Molekulare Mechanismen

## Hintergrund:
In der Pathogenese entzündlicher Herzmuskelerkrankungen werden seit geraumer Zeit unterschiedliche Mechanismen diskutiert. Zum einen führt die Infektion des Myokards mit kardiotropen Erregern, hervorgerufen durch eine Reihe unterschiedlicher Viren, aber auch bakterielle Infektionen mit Chlamydien oder Borrelien, zu einer Entzündung des Herzmuskels. Auf der anderen Seite kommt dem Immunsystem mit seinen Effektormolekülen wie T- und B-Lymphozyten und Zytokinen im Hinblick auf die Entzündungsreaktion eine wichtige Rolle zu. Bisher sind jedoch die Ursachen für eine zunehmende Herzinsuffizienz bei Patienten mit entzündlicher Herzmuskelerkrankung noch nicht im einzelnen verstanden.

## Pathophysiologie:
Tiermodelle zur Pathogenese der Myokarditis haben viel zum Verständnis der antikardialen Immunaktion, möglicherweise ausgelöst als Antwort auf virale oder bakterielle Infektionen, beigetragen. Organspezifität, Kreuzreaktivität zwischen mikrobiellen Oberflächen und kardialen Antigenen und die Induktion einer Toleranz gegenüber Selbstantigenen sind Gegenstand der Diskussion. Zytokine, freigesetzt von einer Reihe von kardialen Zellen, und Zellen des Immunsystems aktivieren und modulieren sowohl das angeborene als auch das spezifische Immunsystem, wobei beide an der Kontrolle einer Virusinfektion beteiligt sind. Das angeborene Immunsystem mit bestimmten, für jedes Individuum festgelegten Möglichkeiten der Abwehr initiiert und kontrolliert die spezifischen Immunantworten.

liert alle weiteren Abwehrfunktionen des spezifischen Immunsystems. In Seren und Myokardgewebe von Patienten mit entzündlicher Herzmuskelerkrankung konnten inzwischen Antikörper und T-Lymphozyten nachgewiesen werden, die gegen Bestandteile des myokardialen Gewebes gerichtet sind. Durch moderne Untersuchungsmethoden wie Polymerasekettenreaktion (PCR), Southern-Blot-Hybridisierung und In-situ-Hybridisierung konnte außerdem der Nachweis von unterschiedlichen kardiotropen Erregern im Myokard geführt werden. Bisher ist es weiterhin Gegenstand der Diskussion, ob das Virus oder Bakterium selbst, der sich aus der Infektion entwickelnde Entzündungsprozess oder beide Mechanismen für

die Einschränkung der Ventrikelfunktion und das Voranschreiten der Erkrankung bis zur schweren Herzinsuffizienz verantwortlich sind.

**Schlussfolgerung:** Legt man diese pathogenetischen Mechanismen zugrunde, ist die Untersuchung der Endomyokardbiopsie durch moderne molekularbiologische und immunhistochemische Verfahren zum Nachweis kardiotroper Erreger und der Entzündungsreaktion inzwischen unbestritten die Methode der Wahl. Die differenzierte ätiologische Diagnostik aus Myokardgewebe ist die unverzichtbare Voraussetzung für klinische Therapiestudien, die die unterschiedlichen pathogenetischen Aspekte der Erkrankung berücksichtigen.

### Introduction

Both, myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy reflect inflammatory processes in cardiac tissue and were introduced in 1837 by Sobernheim [47]. Myocarditis is the major cause of sudden unexpected death in patients less than 40 years of age and may account for up to 20% of mortality from cardiovascular causes [25, 14]. Chronic myocarditis on the other hand is usually asymptomatic, few data are available concerning incidence and prevalence of the disease [10]. However, large unslected autopsy series indicate that 1–5% of the general population suffer from undiagnosed myocarditis, i.e. the disease might be more common than generally assumed [20]. In 30% of cases, myocarditis can give rise to dilated cardiomyopathy with progression to heart failure [17], where prognosis is poor with a 10-year survival rate of less than 40%.

Introduced in the early 1980s, endomyocardial biopsies provided a means of assessing inflammatory reactions in human heart [45]. Because early biopsy studies elicited highly variable results with incidence of myocarditis ranging from 0–80% [18, 67], the Dallas criteria for the histological diagnosis were introduced in 1987 to resolve the problem of differences in methods of diagnostic evaluation [3].

The term inflammatory cardiomyopathy was introduced in 1995 by the World Health Organisation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology Task Force (ISFC, presently World Heart Federation, WHF) on the Definition and Classification of Cardiomyopathies [36, 59]. Inflammatory cardiomyopathy was defined as “myocarditis in association with cardiac dysfunction”, with idiopathic, autoimmune and infectious subtypes. Histologic criteria were then updated by the introduction of immunohistochemical methods: Especially chronic inflammatory processes were characterized by defining a cut-off for the number of infiltrating leukocytes necessary for the diagnosis (≥ 14 infiltrating lymphocytes/mm³, up to four macrophages may be included) and by subtyping a given inflammatory infiltrate.

So far, the treatment of myocarditis is mainly symptomatic including the management of heart failure including diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and digitalis, in severe cases inotropic support, mechanical circulatory assistance and heart transplantation. New therapeutic options, based on the knowledge of pathophysiology and graded according to the results obtained by modern diagnostic tools, are now available [36, 37].

### Cause of the Disease

Although etiology of myocarditis in a given patient often remains unknown, a large variety of infectious agents, systemic diseases, drugs and toxins have been associated with the development of the disease [1, 31]. In general, infectious agents, including viruses such as enteroviruses, cytomegalovirus, and adenoviruses, bacteria such as *Borrelia burgdorferi* or *Chlamydia pneumonia*, protozoa and even fungi can cause myocarditis.

Consensus has been reached that viral infections are the most important causes of myocarditis in North America and Europe. Initially, rising antibody titers against specific virus in serum of patients during acute myocarditis and reconvalescence were used to demonstrate infection.
strate etiologic relevance [9]: In 1981, the WHO summarized these data, which show clearly that infection with coxsackievirus, influenza virus, cytomegalovirus, echovirus and adenovirus were the most common cause of myocarditis. More recently, genome of entero-, adeno-, cytomegalo-, influenza-, hepatitis C, and parvovirus B19 have been identified in endomyocardial biopsies of patients with myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy using polymerase chain reaction [4, 7, 21, 38 39, 44, 46, 53, 62]. Whether these viruses play a pathogenic role or act merely as innocent bystander is still a matter of debate.

Bergelson et al [6] demonstrated that enterovirus and adenovirus share a common cell surface receptor, the coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (CAR). Efficacy in targeting the host cell by these viruses depends on distinct coreceptors: CVB3, for example, uses the complement deflecting protein decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) [66] and adenovirus distinct integrins [60]. Blocking these receptors may therefore prevent infection of cardiomyocytes and thereby the development of myocarditis at a very early stage.

### Lessons from Animal Models of Myocarditis: the Role of T Cells and the Immune System

Our understanding of the pathophysiology of myocarditis stems largely from studies in animals, in which susceptible mouse strains or immuno-compromised animals were infected with cardiotropic virus such as coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Infection with CVB3 leads in mice to the formation of inflammatory infiltrates in myocardial tissue resembling those observed in human myocarditis. After infection, distinct stages of disease can be identified histologically: The first stage is characterized by viral replication and cell lysis in cardiac tissue, which does not result in heart failure. However, with the onset of specific immune responses, inflammatory infiltrates are observed in myocardium of susceptible mice, which consist of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, monocytes and macrophages. Virus titer peaks at day 3–4 after infection with CVB3, and inflammation plus necrosis at day 7–14. At the same time, anti-cardiac antibodies occur in sera of infected mice [23]. Susceptibility to viral infection, extent of inflammation, and persistence of viral infection are influenced by the virus and mouse strain, the animals’ age and sex [18, 72].

Infection of adult cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, isolated from mouse heart, with CVB3 were studied by Herzum et al [22], who were able to show that isolated myocytes were killed within 16 hours of infection by the

virus itself, whereas fibroblasts survived. Since coxsackievirus B3 is able to kill cardiomyocytes, a specific antiviral immune response mediated by T lymphocytes is crucial to eliminate the virus and to prevent spreading of infection.

The mouse model of myosin-induced myocarditis, first published by Neu et al [50] is based on the mouse model of CVB3-induced myocarditis, in that he made use of the observation that in certain mouse strains a prominent autoimmune response against myosin heavy chain is mounted. Immunization with this cardiac protein led to myocarditis in susceptible mouse strains, which resembled that seen in CVB3-induced myocarditis. Peak of inflammation was observed on day 21 after infection. The inflammatory infiltrate comprised macrophages (80%), T lymphocytes (20%, most of them CD4-positive) and only few B lymphocytes. Subsequent studies were able to show that myosin-induced myocarditis is a T cell mediated disease using transfer studies and several transgenic mouse models. In addition, T cell epitopes were identified, which in turn were able to induce myocarditis by themselves [24, 26, 57, 58].

#### Induction of Autoreactivity

These studies have provided insight into the pathophysiology of inflammatory heart disease. Mechanisms probably inducing myocarditis were summarized by Malkiel et al [42]: Normally, self-reactive lymphocytes generated in the bone marrow and thymus were deleted or inactivated before moving into the periphery. Activation or tolerization of mature T and B lymphocytes in the periphery depends on the mode of antigen presentation. T cells become activated when the T cell-receptor recognizes an antigenic peptide located inside an MHC molecule expressed on an antigen-presenting cell (dendritic cell or macrophage). The antigen-presenting cell itself must be activated to express costimulatory signals which are essential for efficient T cell activation. In addition, the concentration of peptide is crucial for T cell activation: Peptides must be presented in large enough quantities to activate T cells. Similarly, a B cell requires antigen and costimulation delivered by an activated T cell to become activated. After antigen presentation an immune response is initiated, which should react specifically against microbial peptide, leading to the elimination of the invader and recovery from disease. Three hypotheses are to be considered, which may trigger pathogenic heart-specific autoreactivity:
Pankuweit S, et al. Molecular Mechanisms in Cardiac Inflammation

1. Activation by a foreign antigen: Processing of a foreign antigen might result in the presentation of an epitope highly homologous to cardiac myosin, as a consequence cross-reactive T cells are activated.
2. Increased presentation of self-peptides: Viral infection and necrosis of myocytes may lead to the release of intracellular antigens, extracellular concentration of which is normally very low. Release of these proteins in larger quantities increases the threshold necessary for an immune response, resulting in activation of self-reactive T cells.
3. Presentation of cryptic self-peptides: In addition, altered processing of intracellular localized proteins might occur, resulting in activation of self-reactive T cells (Figure 1). This mechanism may then propagate an immune response to cardiac antigen in the absence of further infectious triggers [70].

### Cross-Reactive Epitopes in Myocarditis

Several studies support the hypothesis of molecular mimicry as one of the mechanisms, which may give rise to myocarditis in animal models. Cross-reactive CD4-positive T lymphocytes binding to myosin heavy chain, coxsackievirus B3, and streptococcal M protein have been identified [12, 13, 23, 24, 43, 54, 68]. Interestingly, a peptide cross-reacting between streptococcal M protein and cardiac myosin tolerated and protected MRL/++ mice against autoimmune myocarditis due to CVB3 infection [24].

Nevertheless, it is still a matter of debate as to whether or not mimicry between CVB3 and cardiac myosin plays a role in the pathogenesis of myocarditis: Luppi et al [33] for example have shown that infection with CVB3 induces expression of specific T cell-receptor molecules with high cytotoxic potency on the surface of infiltrating T lymphocytes and have argued that not a specific but a superantigen-mediated immune response is involved in human myocarditis.

In addition, recent data provide evidence of cross-reactivity between *Clamydia pneumonia* as well as *Trypanosoma cruzi* and cardiac myosin and indicate that bacterial as well as parasitic antigens can trigger tissue-specific inflammation of the heart [5].

### The Role of Antibodies in Myocarditis

Patients with myocarditis display serum autoantibodies to a number of cardiac antigens, for example the myolemma and the sarcolemma [40, 41], acetylcholine receptor [19], β-receptor [30, 34, 71], adenine nucleotide translocator and ADP/ATP carrier [63, 64], calcium-channel [27], contractile proteins such as myosin and actin [8], intracellular proteins such as enzymes of the energy metabolism [2, 51, 55, 63] or heat shock proteins [56] and last but not least extracellular antigens such as collagen. Occurrence of these antibodies in sera of pa-

Makrophagen oder dendritischen Zellen) notwendig. Diese prozessieren (verarbeiten) das Antigen, welches dann in Form von Epitopen über MHC-Moleküle den T-Zellen dargeboten wird. Das „Processing“ eines Fremdantigens kann in Präsentation eines Epitops resultieren, das homolog zu kardialem Myosin ist. Konsequenz ist die Aktivierung einer kreuzreaktiven T-Zelle. Ein verändertes Processing normalerweise intrazellulär lokalierter Proteine kann schließlich in der Aktivierung autoreaktiver T-Zellen resultieren.

tients correlates with the extent of inflammation in the myocardium, antibodies induce cytotoxicity in vitro with and without complement, and binding of antibodies is inhibited by absorption with viral proteins indicating cross-reactivity [15, 35, 37]. However, it is now widely accepted that the majority of antibodies directed against cardiac antigens found in serum of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy, do not play a major pathogenic role but are indicative of damage to cardiac tissue and show a tendency towards autoimmune disease [49].

In contrast, recent data on the improvement of myocardial function of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy after specific immunoglobulin adsorption eliminating circulating antibodies show that we may still underestimate the role of autoantibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy with and without inflammation [48].

### The Role of Cytokines in Myocarditis

Infection is a strong inducer of either TH₁ or TH₂ cytokines, depending on the type of infectious pathogen, such as intracellular microorganisms, viruses, extracellular bacteria, superantigens, or parasitic microbes [25]. Infection as well as genetic predisposition may play an important role in the cytokine phenotype expressed and the subsequent onset of autoimmune myocarditis [16, 28]. Cytokines are important in controlling T cells responsive to self-antigens and are critical in shifting the immune response towards a TH₁ or a TH₂ pattern. Recent evidence suggests that both B and T cells as well as NK and dendritic cells are involved in the production of polarizing cytokines. The TH₁ response shifts the cytokine profile towards delayed hypersensitivity, macrophage activation, IgG 1 and 3 production, and a proinflammatory T cell-response associated with IFN-γ and interleukin (IL)-12, whereas the TH₂ response is associated with B cell activation, and IL-4, -5, -10, IgG 4 and IgE production. IL-12 has been shown to induce the differentiation of TH₁ autoreactive T cells and to enhance autoimmune disease in certain animal models [65]. TH₁ T cells secrete IL-2 and IFNγ thereby suppressing TH₂ responses, whereas TH₂ T cells secrete IL-4 and IL-10 thereby inhibiting TH₁ responses [50]. The A/J mouse model of TH₂-mediated disease is an excellent example of how IL-4 can mediate myocarditis and IFNγ can protect against disease [49, 69].

Regarding this aspect, myocarditis in humans is less well understood as compared to animal models, but could result from either a TH₁ or a TH₂ response [11].

Therefore, modulation of the TH₁/TH₂ balance as a new therapeutic strategy in myocarditis will require careful evaluation of the different stages of myocarditis since they may be associated with different cytokine profiles.

#### Conclusion

Many faces of myocarditis coexist where different phases of the disease progress simultaneously [32]: phase 1 is dominated by viral infection itself, phase 2 by the onset of (probably) multiple autoimmune reactions, and phase 3 by the progression to cardiac dilatation. Appropriate treatment during phase 1 includes eradication of virus and amelioration of injury caused by the virus. During phase 2, which is characterized by autoimmune processes, immunosuppression is the most appropriate therapy and warrants sophisticated diagnostic strategies including molecular biological and immunohistochemical techniques. Phase 3, dilated cardiomyopathy, although a result of viral and autoimmune injury, may then progress independently.

A reclassification of members of the immune system was suggested in 1996 to show the duality of the system [31]. The host benefits from components of the immune system such as interferon and NK cells by attenuating viral proliferation and limiting viral damage; other components may cause collateral damage to host tissue. The most ideal components include those able to attenuate viral proliferation while protecting cardiomyocytes.

**Figure 3.** Progression of disease. A delicate balance exists between the initial viral infection and the ensuing (auto-)immune processes, with interactions among the viral, immune and myocardial components of the disease process. When the disease progresses, there can be low-grade persistence of the virus in the myocardium and/or the immunological response can also persist, leading to chronic dilated cardiomyopathy.

**Abbildung 3.** Übergang der Myokarditis in eine dilatative Kardiomyopathie. Zwischen der initialen Phase der Virusinfektion und der nachfolgenden Immunreaktion kann lange Zeit ein Gleichgewicht bestehen, wobei Bestandteile des Virus, des Immunsystems und des Myokards miteinander interagieren. Chronische Infektion oder lang andauernde Autoimmunprozesse können aber zum Voranschreiten der Erkrankungen mit Ausbildung einer dilatativen Kardiomyopathie und zunehmender Herzinsuffizienz führen.

Immune system such as interferon and NK cells by attenuating viral proliferation and limiting viral damage, other components may cause collateral damage to host tissue. The most ideal components include those able to attenuate viral proliferation while protecting cardiomyocytes (Figure 2).

Thus, a delicate balance exists between the initial viral infection and the ensuing (auto-)immune processes (Figure 3), which has to be taken into account when initiating new diagnostic and therapeutic concepts to prevent progression of myocarditis to cardiomyopathy with severe heart failure [61].
