### Abstract

The intracellular opportunistic protozoan *Toxoplasma gondii* is a potent stimulus for cell-mediated immunity, and IL-12-dependent IFN-γ induction is vital in resistance to the parasite. Dendritic cells, neutrophils and macrophages are important sources of IL-12 during infection. *T. gondii* possesses two mechanisms for triggering IL-12. One is dependent upon the common adaptor protein MyD88, and is likely to involve Toll-like receptors. The other is a more unusual pathway that involves triggering through CCR5 by a parasite cyclophilin molecule. Countering these potent pro-inflammatory activities, *T. gondii* has several mechanisms to down-regulate immunity. Intracellular infection causes a blockade in the NFκB macrophage signaling pathway, correlating with reduced capacity for IL-12 and TNF-α production. The parasite also prevents STAT1 activity, resulting in decreased levels of IFN-γ-stimulated MHC surface antigen expression. Furthermore, infection also induces resistance to apoptosis through inhibition of caspase activity. Extracellular pathways of suppression involve soluble mediators such as IL-10 and lipoxins that have potent IL-12 down-regulatory effects. The balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signaling which *T. gondii* engages is likely dictated by requirements for a stable host-parasite interaction. First, there is a need for *Toxoplasma* to induce an immune response robust enough to allow host survival and establish long-term chronic infection. Second, the parasite must avoid immune-elimination and induction of pro-inflammatory pathology that can cause lethality if unchecked. The widespread distribution of *T. gondii* and the normally innocuous nature of infection indicate the skill with which the parasite achieves the two seemingly contrary goals.

### 1. Introduction

Microbial parasites, whether viral, bacterial, fungal or protozoan, must survive encounter with the host immune system to establish successful infection. For those microorganisms that persist in the host, this is a dynamic process requiring that the pathogen avoids immune-elimination, but not to the extent that the host succumbs to infection. A case-in-point is the parasitic protozoan *Toxoplasma gondii*. The principle of pathogen regulation of immunity is strikingly illustrated by the complex interactions sparked when *Toxoplasma* encounters cells of the innate immune system.

*Toxoplasma* is a globally distributed pathogen of humans and animals. Between 30 and 80% of the human population carries latent infection with this opportunistic parasite. In situations of immunodeficiency, *T. gondii* emerges as a life-threatening infection. This is a risk in AIDS patients, where approximately 25% of those carrying latent *T. gondii* infection will undergo reactivating toxoplasmosis in the central nervous system [1]. Congenital infection can result in debilitating disease that may be apparent at birth, or more commonly may occur as sequelae of infection later in life [2]. Congenital toxoplasmosis also has an economic impact in countries such as England and New Zealand where it is a major cause of abortion in sheep [3].

Infection with *T. gondii* is initiated by oral ingestion of either oocysts shed by cats, or—probably more commonly—consumption of tissue cysts in undercooked meat [4]. The acute phase of infection is characterized by widespread dissemination of rapidly dividing tachyzoites that invade virtually all cell types. Invasion is an active para-

site-mediated process delivering the tachyzoite to a unique parasitophorous vacuole that resists endosomal acidification [5]. After six to eight parasite divisions the host cell lyses, and released tachyzoites infect surrounding cells and tissues. Chronic infection, which correlates with the rise in adaptive immunity, is associated with differentiation into bradyzoites that form quiescent cysts deep within tissues of the central nervous system and skeletal muscle. Unless the host is undergoing reactivating infection, tissue cysts are manifest by remarkably complete absence of a surrounding inflammatory reaction [6].

## 2. Function of Type 1 immunity during *T. gondii* infection

Toxoplasma elicits a strong Type 1 immune response [7]. Infection is marked by induction of intracellular regulators of Th1 differentiation such as T-bet, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT4, and subsequent generation of IFN-γ-secreting Th1 T cells and CD8⁺ T lymphocytes that release IFN-γ and display cytolytic activity against infected target cells [8–13]. The ability to survive infection is dependent upon IFN-γ, which is recognized as the major mediator of resistance against *T. gondii* [14,15]. T lymphocytes are a critical source of IFN-γ during chronic-stage infection, as shown several years ago in antibody-mediated T-cell depletion experiments that result in reactivation of infection [16]. In the innate immune system similar depletion experiments suggest natural killer cells as an important IFN-γ source that allows host survival prior to generation of adaptive immunity [17,18]. More recent evidence points to possible roles for macrophages (MØ) and dendritic cells (DC) as producers of IFN-γ allowing early survival [19].

Although low-level IFN-γ production occurs in the absence of IL-12 signaling, optimal induction is strictly IL-12-dependent [11]. The major IL-12 sources during infection are MØ, DC and neutrophils, and *T. gondii* can directly trigger IL-12 release from each of these cell types in vitro [20–22]. The key function of IL-12 is to activate STAT4 and thereby promote Th1 differentiation (Fig. 1). The latter occurs either through chromatin re-modeling or by selection of T-cell precursors whose fate has already been determined by master-regulatory molecules such as T-bet [23]. T-bet itself is rapidly induced by IFN-γ during *T. gondii* infection [8]. IL-12 also promotes NK cell IFN-γ production, an activity augmented by cytokines such as IL-18, IL-1β and TNF-α [18,20,24]. Recent data suggest a role for IL-12 in triggering STAT4-dependent IFN-γ and nitric oxide production in MØ and DC during *T. gondii* infection [19] (Fig. 1). In addition, new studies are illuminating the importance of cytokines and signaling intermediates such as T-bet and WSX1/IL-27 in Th1 differentiation [25]. Nevertheless, there is little dispute that IL-12

Fig. 1. Signaling circuitry during early *T. gondii* infection. Tachyzoites elicit IL-12 from MØ, DC and PMN. Acting through STAT4, IL-12 promotes production of IFN-γ. In turn, through intracellular signaling intermediates such as STAT1 and T-bet, IFN-γ can induce differentiation of Th1 T lymphocytes and possibly CD8⁺ and NK cells. Whether T-bet, STAT1 or STAT4 take the role of master regulator of Th1 differentiation is currently a matter of debate. IFN-γ signaling through STAT1 is also involved in promoting IL-12 production by antigen-presenting cells. More recent evidence indicates that STAT4 signaling promotes IFN-γ production from DC and MØ. The major antimicrobial effects of IFN-γ during *T. gondii* infection – generation of nitric oxide, and induction of IGTP and LRG-47 – are mediated through STAT1.
remains a central molecule not only in generation but also in maintenance of Type 1 cytokine responses to *Toxoplasma* [26].

IFN-γ mediates its protective function during infection with *T. gondii* and other microbial pathogens through signaling intermediate STAT1 [9,10] (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, the effector mechanisms involved are not completely clear. iNOS-dependent nitric oxide production by IFN-γ-activated MΦ is a highly efficient tachyzoite killing mechanism in vitro, and was assumed for several years to be a major defense mechanism against intracellular infection with *Toxoplasma* and other microbial pathogens. Mice deficient in the iNOS gene are indeed more susceptible to *T. gondii* infection than wild-type animals [27]. Nevertheless, the animals are fully capable of surviving acute infection, unlike IFN-γ⁻/⁻ or IL-12⁻/⁻ animals. The latter observation clearly indicates that other IFN-γ-dependent, iNOS-independent mechanisms are required in resistance to *T. gondii*.

More recently, a new family of IFN-γ-inducible genes has been identified and of these, IGTP and LRG-47 have emerged as being essential to survive acute *T. gondii* infection [28] (Fig. 1). Both IGTP and LRG-47 knockout (KO) mice succumb with the same kinetics as animals genetically deficient in IFN-γ or IL-12. Interestingly, while LRG-47 KO mice are susceptible to *Listeria monocytogenes*, lack of IGTP has no effect on resistance to this bacterium. Both IGTP and the IFN-γ receptor must be expressed in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells to confer resistance to infection [9,29]. The IGTP and LRG-47 molecules are GTP-binding proteins and they localize to the host cell endoplasmic reticulum, but how they exert effector function against pathogens such as *Toxoplasma* remains a matter of speculation.

It is clear that *Toxoplasma* is highly effective at inducing IFN-γ and that this cytokine is a vital component in the immune response during infection. Indeed, from the standpoint of parasite survival and long-term persistence, it is advantageous for *T. gondii* to elicit a protective immune response. Absence of appropriate immunity rapidly leads to death, as shown most clearly by infection of mice lacking expression of IL-12 and IFN-γ, and in T-cell-deficient SCID mice [15,30]. In the clinical setting, the requirement for strong cell-mediated immunity is dramatically underscored by occurrence of toxoplasmic encephalitis during AIDS progression. From the parasite perspective these are not desirable outcomes. It is most advantageous for the parasite to keep its host alive until transmission to another can occur – for the case of *Toxoplasma*, through oral transmission of tissue cysts.

However, an immune response that is too vigorous can be equally disadvantageous to the parasite. First, an optimal protective response may lead to sterile immunity, and in this regard *Toxoplasma* must seek to evade the immune system. Second, pro-inflammatory cytokines triggered by *T. gondii* lead to lethal immunopathology when overproduced, again acting to minimize chances of transmission. There are several examples of pro-inflammatory cytokine toxicity during *T. gondii* infection. IL-10 KO mice succumb to normally non-lethal infection, and death is associated with overproduction of IL-12, TNF-α and IFN-γ [31,32]. During oral infection, susceptible C57BL/6 mice develop severe gut pathology mediated by CD4⁺ T cells and IFN-γ that ultimately leads to death [33]. Here, IL-10 also plays a vital role in minimizing intestinal immunopathology [34].

Another example of *Toxoplasma*-triggered, cytokine-mediated pathology relates to pathogenesis of infection with certain strains of the parasite. *Toxoplasma* displays an unusual population structure that comprises three clonal lineages [35]. Of these, Types II and III strains display low virulence in mice and establish long-term chronic infections. This is not the case for Type I strains that are uniformly lethal in mice, and as such are self-limiting infections. Type I *Toxoplasma* strains, identifiable by DNA polymorphism, owe their lethality at least in part to an abnormal over-induction of normally protective Type I cytokines [36,37]. Interestingly, there is evidence that Type I strains may be more prevalent in certain manifestations of human toxoplasmosis, in particular during ocular disease [38]. This raises the possibility that *Toxoplasma*-induced cytokine overproduction may contribute to disease pathogenesis in humans.

Notwithstanding the above examples, *T. gondii* most commonly causes asymptomatic infection, and it is reasonable to assume that this contributes significantly to the fact that *Toxoplasma* is so widespread in human and animal populations. This overt phenomenon indicates the underlying skill with which *Toxoplasma* manipulates host immunity. The sophistication of *T. gondii* as a master manipulator of host responses is particularly true with regard to the innate immune system. Here, *T. gondii* simultaneously displays the capacity to trigger protective cytokine responses, and paradoxically the ability to suppress the same types of immune functions. The advantage of this dual property to the parasite is clear, but we are only now beginning to understand the cellular and molecular basis for how the balance is achieved.

### 3. Induction of innate immunity by *T. gondii*

DC, MΦ and neutrophils release IL-12 when directly infected or exposed to soluble tachyzoite lysate antigens (Fig. 1). This property was first shown for bone marrow-derived MΦ, although more recent evidence indicates that IL-12 production in MΦ occurs only after a delay of approximately 24 h [20,39]. DC, on the other hand, respond rapidly. For example, within 3 h of systemic administration of soluble parasite lysate antigen (STAg), CD8⁺ splenic DC become IL-12-positive and redistribute to T-cell areas of the spleen [21]. Up-regulation of IL-12
induced by systemic STAg does not require, but is promoted by, CD40 ligation [40]. A similar CD40/CD154 augmentation has been found for IL-12 production by *Toxoplasma*-stimulated human peripheral blood-derived DC [41]. However, while CD154 KO mice produce somewhat less IL-12 during *T. gondii* infection, induction of IFN-$\gamma$ is normal and the animals survive acute infection [42]. This is not to suggest that CD40L is dispensable during *T. gondii* infection, because CD154$^{-/-}$ mice eventually succumb to toxoplasmic encephalitis, suggesting a role for CD40 ligand in control of parasitic infection in the brain [42].

Six days after *Toxoplasma* infection, splenic DC undergo strong activation and produce IL-12. Activation, as measured by increased co-stimulatory molecule expression on both CD8$^{+}$ and CD8$^{-}$ CD11c$^{+}$ DC subsets, is defective in the genetic absence of CD154/CD40L [43]. The disparity between this study and others regarding CD40 ligand requirement for DC activation may stem from differences in timing (hours vs. days) or form of the stimulus (antigen vs. live parasites). It is also possible that the CD154 dependence of co-stimulatory molecule up-regulation does not accurately reflect IL-12 production by these cells. Regardless, the ability of DC to acquire and present antigen to T lymphocytes and simultaneously produce IL-12 suggests a central role for the cells in initiating T-cell activation and driving differentiation to the Th1 effector phenotype. Support for this concept comes from studies showing that murine bone marrow-derived DC pulsed in vitro with *T. gondii* antigens induce Type 1 cytokines and confer protective immunity in vivo [44].

Production of IL-12 by parasite-triggered polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) occurs rapidly in vitro, both in terms of p40 gene induction and release of IL-12(p40) and IL-12(p70) [22,45]. Neutrophil IL-12 production does not require IFN-$\gamma$, as shown by gene knockout studies [22]. The response also presumably does not require CD40-CD154-mediated activation, since PMN do not express significant levels of these surface proteins.

We identified a neutrophil population that expresses preformed stores of IL-12 in the absence of overt infection. The PMN subpopulation is present in the peripheral blood and peritoneal cavity, and is rapidly recruited during intraperitoneal infection [46]. In addition, more sustained neutrophil IL-12 release is achieved through increased transcriptional activity. The concept that *T. gondii* triggers release of preformed IL-12, and induces de novo synthesis of the cytokine is not without precedent. Fc$\varepsilon$R cross-linking in mast cells leads to release of intracellular pools of TNF-$\alpha$ as well as up-regulation of the TNF-$\alpha$ gene [47].

During in vivo infection, the influx of IL-12-positive PMN is dependent upon chemokine receptor CXCR2, and absence of the latter increases susceptibility to *T. gondii* [48]. Recent evidence also indicates that *T. gondii* triggers PMN production of mediators such as TNF-$\alpha$,

MIP-3$\alpha$ (CCL20), MIP-1$\alpha$ (CCL2), MIP-1$\beta$ (CCL3) and RANTES (CCL4). The chemokines in turn exhibit potent DC chemotactic and activating properties [49]. These findings, and similar data published by others, have led us to hypothesize that neutrophils are important immunoregulatory cells during infection with *Toxoplasma* and other microbial pathogens [50]. In this model, PMN recruit DC to foci of infection, thereby promoting contact of the latter with parasites and antigens, as well as releasing DC-activating cytokines. Indeed, in vivo depletion of cells bearing the PMN marker Gr1 (Ly6G) results in increased susceptibility and defective Type 1 cytokine responses during several microbial infections, including *T. gondii* [51–53].

The in vivo Gr1 depletion studies are provocative with regard to the immunoregulatory role they implicate for neutrophils. Nevertheless, the data must be interpreted with some caution. While PMN are the major cell type expressing Gr1, the marker has recently been found on a subset of plasmacytoid-like splenic CD11c$^{+}$ DC [54]. Although studies have failed to unearth evidence that this DC subset is a source of IL-12 during *T. gondii* infection ([49], [55]), it is clearly necessary to exercise care in interpreting results of in vivo Gr1$^{+}$ cell-depletion experiments.

Signaling cascades leading to IL-12 production during *T. gondii* infection are incompletely characterized. The transcription factor interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) has been implicated in IL-12(p40) gene induction during M$\varnothing$ stimulation with *Toxoplasma* and microbial products such as LPS. Mice lacking ICSBP display a selective defect in M$\varnothing$ IL-12 production, and animals die with the same kinetics as IL-12 and IFN-$\gamma$ KO mice [56]. The finding that defective IL-12 production occurs in the absence of exogenous IFN-$\gamma$ suggests that the parasite directly triggers ICSBP, although it is also possible that low-level M$\varnothing$ IFN-$\gamma$ expression triggers IL-12 through ICSBP induction. Recent evidence indicates that ICSBP acts through a novel interferon stimulated responsive element (ISRE)-like site in the mouse IL-12(p40) promoter [57]. This region is located downstream of NF$\kappa$B and C/EBP sites that are also implicated in IL-12 promoter activity [58,59].

Toll-like receptors (TLR) are now recognized as an important class of pattern-recognition receptors involved in innate immune recognition of diverse microbial antigens, including mycobacterial lipids, CpG DNA, yeast zymosan and protozoal glycosylphosphatidylinositol molecules [60]. TLR signaling involves recruitment of MyD88 that mediates activation of IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) proteins. The latter event is followed by TRAF-6 recruitment, leading to activation of NF$\kappa$B and MAPK signaling pathways that induce transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. The TLR signaling cascade is implicated in *T. gondii*-elicited IL-12. This is because MyD88-negative PMN, DC and M$\varnothing$ are each severely crippled in IL-
12 producing ability when subjected to *T. gondii* triggering [61]. Predictably, the in vivo IFN-γ response of MyD88⁻/⁻ mice is drastically reduced and the animals are highly susceptible to infection.

Although the precise TLR involved in IL-12 induction are not yet known, a recent report implicates parasite glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPI) as potential TLR ligands. Tachyzoites abundantly express GPI-anchored surface proteins as well as free GPI [62]. Glycan moieties from *Toxoplasma* GPI stimulate TNF-α production by mouse macrophage line RAW264.7 [63]. These findings recall studies in *Trypanosoma cruzi*, which also implicate involvement of parasite GPI in induction of macrophage cytokine synthesis [64]. Microbial GPI may form a class of the so-called pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) molecules that are recognized by TLR.

Involvement of MyD88 in the response to *T. gondii* suggests a role for NFκB signaling in IL-12 production, but this remains to be demonstrated. Most studies on regulation of IL-12 production have focused on the p40 IL-12 subunit, since the latter is strongly inducible by inflammatory stimulation. The p40 promoter contains an NFκB half-site that interacts with Rel proteins, in addition to C/EBP binding domains [58, 59]. There are several NFκB family members (RelA/p65, RelB, c-Rel, p50, p52), although only RelA, RelB and c-Rel are known to possess transactivating potential [65]. Inasmuch as only c-Rel appears critical for LPS-induced IL-12 production, it is noteworthy that *Toxoplasma*-triggered IL-12 responses are normal in c-Rel KO mice [66, 67]. Studies in other NFκB KO animals (RelB, p50, p52) have revealed defects in innate (RelB) and acquired (p50, p52) immune responses to *T. gondii* (reviewed in [68]), but in each case IL-12 production proceeds normally. The observation clearly suggests involvement of p65, but a role for this Rel protein has been difficult to evaluate because of the embryonic lethality of p65 KO mice.

*Toxoplasma* appears so far unique in that it possesses a second mechanism to trigger DC and MØ IL-12 production. The parasite expresses an 18-kDa cyclophilin (C-18) that is released by extracellular tachyzoites, and that triggers IL-12 production through binding to chemokine receptor CCR5 [69]. DC from CCR5⁻/⁻ mice display defects in IL-12 production and are increased in susceptibility to *T. gondii* [70]. The biochemical pathway leading from CCR5 to activation of IL-12 gene transcription is not yet clear, but presumably involves G-protein-dependent signaling because of the well-established link between the seven transmembrane domain chemokine receptors and this class of signal-transducing molecules. The finding that pertussis toxin, a reagent that uncouples Gαi-protein signaling, antagonizes the effects of STAg is consistent with G-protein-dependent IL-12 production [70]. Nevertheless, the results are difficult to reconcile with others that suggest a role for Gαi-dependent signaling in suppression of IL-12 responses [71]. The apparently disparate

Fig. 2. *T. gondii* triggers MyD88 and CCR5-dependent pathways leading to IL-12 production. The requirement for MyD88 in IL-12 production implicates upstream involvement of TLR molecules and downstream participation of NFκB and MAP kinase pathways. This general pathway is employed by many microbial pathogens in triggering innate immunity. In addition, *Toxoplasma* possesses an unusual means of triggering IL-12 synthesis. In this case, the parasite secretes a chemokine mimic, cyclophilin-18, that binds to CCR5 causing IL-12 production. The sensitivity of CCR5-dependent IL-12 production to pertussis toxin implies involvement of Gαi-like proteins in the downstream signaling cascade. The model shown here does not incorporate the possibility that optimal IL-12 production may involve co-dependent signaling through CCR5 and MyD88 (see text for further details).

findings may reflect the presence of as yet unidentified Gαi subunits with distinct signaling functions.

The precise relationship between CCR5- and MyD88-dependent signaling for IL-12 production during *T. gondii* infection is not completely clear. The purified C-18 molecule has less DC IL-12-inducing activity relative to STAg in wild-type cells, and CCR5-negative DC do not respond to C-18, whereas MyD88⁻/⁻ DC respond normally to the cyclophilin [61, 69]. STAg-induced responses are reduced but not completely eliminated in both CCR5⁻/⁻ and MyD88⁻/⁻ DC. Together, the results suggest two pathways leading to DC IL-12 production, one involving a parasite chemokine mimic that binds to CCR5, and the other involving MyD88 and probably TLR (Fig. 2). These dual IL-12 induction pathways triggered by *Toxoplasma* may, at least in part, account for the ability of the parasite to induce such a strongly polarized Th1 response during infection. An alternative possibility is that the pathways are co-dependent. The chaperone-like activity of cyclophilins suggests that C-18 and another parasite cofactor may together engage CCR5 and a TLR molecule to trigger maximal IL-12 production [69]. Further work is required to elucidate molecular pathways through which *Toxoplasma* induces IL-12 production in DC, MØ and PMN.

4. Subversion of innate immunity by *T. gondii*

It is clear that *Toxoplasma* provides potent signals for IL-12 production and Th1 generation. In this regard, infection with this parasite has been presented as a paradigm for induction of strong Type 1 immunity by an intracellular pathogen [72]. In contrast, during infection by other protozoan parasites such as *Leishmania*, evasion of pro-inflammatory cytokine induction has long been recognized as an important component in the biology of infection [73,74]. For *Toxoplasma*, the view that the parasite is solely a pro-inflammatory pathogen is oversimplistic. As is clear from recent studies, *T. gondii* displays a previously under-appreciated level of sophistication with regard to avoiding innate immunity.

During intracellular *Toxoplasma* infection, MΦ do not produce TNF-α, and IL-12 production is initiated only after a delay of approximately 24 h [39,75,76]. The lack of response is not simply failure to respond. This is because infected cells cannot produce IL-12, TNF-α or nitric oxide when subjected to LPS triggering. The observation clearly indicates active suppression mediated by *T. gondii*. Inhibition is a characteristic of infected cells only, since in populations consisting of infected and non-infected cells, those MΦ that are parasite-free produce TNF-α when triggered with LPS. Insofar as heat-killed parasites that are internalized by phagocytosis do not display inhibitory activity, subversion of pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis requires active infection of cells [39]. Inhibition is abrogated by treatment with cytochalasin, a drug that allows tachyzoite adherence to the host cell but prevents invasion, again suggesting that viable parasites must gain entry into the host cell to mediate suppression. In addition, cells regain LPS responsiveness when intracellular tachyzoites are inactivated by drug treatment. The combined results demonstrate the potent capacity of live intracellular *Toxoplasma* to subvert macrophage cytokine responses that would otherwise be elicited by molecules (such as C-18 and GPI) that are expressed by the parasite.

Delayed IL-12 production raises the question of whether the cytokine – when it is eventually produced – derives from non-infected MΦ that might encounter newly egressed parasites or their secreted products during long-term infection. Such a model is supported by the finding that extracellular tachyzoites spontaneously release the IL-12-inducing molecule C-18. Non-infected cells do indeed become IL-12-positive after 24 h (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, it is also clear that MΦ harboring live parasites produce IL-12 under the same conditions (Fig. 3). Thus, despite the fact that TNF-α responses remain potently suppressed in infected cells, the blockade in IL-12 production is ultimately lifted, indicating a divergence in parasite manipulation of the two cytokine responses [39].

Non-permanent blockade in IL-12 production may re-

![Figure 3](#fig-3)

Fig. 3. Infected and uninfected MΦ produce IL-12 during extended in vitro culture. Bone marrow-derived MΦ were infected with RH strain tachyzoites, then 24 h later cells were permeabilized and stained with antibodies to *T. gondii* (red) and IL-12 (green) as described elsewhere [81]. Panels A and C show immunofluorescence images and panels B and D show corresponding DIC images. Panels A and B show infected cells that are IL-12-positive. Arrows point to infected cell, and panel A inset illustrates a heavily infected cell that is IL-12-positive. Panels C and D show an uninfected cell (arrow) that is IL-12-positive.

reflect a need to maintain the balance between triggering and suppressing immunity. Autocrine IL-12, acting through STAT4, mediates killing of intracellular tachyzoites—an activity that the parasite would seek to avoid [19]. Nevertheless, the requirement for IL-12 in Th1 induction and long-term survival during infection dictates that the cytokine must be produced to achieve long-term chronic infection. Delaying MΦ IL-12 production may permit *T. gondii* to establish itself within the host before induction of STAT4-dependent effector function.

Similar suppressive effects of *Toxoplasma* have been reported with regard to expression of MHC class I and II molecules on the surface of infected MΦ. Thus, intracellular tachyzoites interfere with up-regulation of these proteins when cells are subjected to IFN-γ triggering [77]. This is, at least in part, due to parasite-induced down-regulation of the IFN-γ-induced class II transactivator protein CIITA [78]. The potential biological significance of the data is revealed by the fact that intracellular infection inhibits the ability of IFN-γ-activated MΦ to present ovalbumin to CD4⁺ T-cell hybridomas [79].

In these studies, the suppressive effects of *T. gondii* are restricted to infected cells. This argues convincingly against *Toxoplasma*-triggered release of immunomodulatory molecules such as IL-10 or prostaglandin E₂ as the basis for cytokine subversion. The results instead point to parasite interference with host intracellular signaling pathways within infected cells. The NFκB activation cascade is well known for its involvement in pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to agents such as LPS, and is a target for inactivation by several bacterial and viral pathogens [80]. *Toxoplasma* infection itself triggers rapid phosphorylation and degradation of the NFκB inhibitory molecule, IkBα [81]. Nevertheless, cytoplasmic p65 fails to translocate into the nucleus in infected MΦ, providing a gross explanation for why cells fail to respond to LPS [81,82]. However, after 24 h, the blockade in NFκB nuclear import is lifted, and translocation occurs when cells are triggered with LPS [39]. It is interesting that inhibition of IFN-γ activity in infected MΦ has also been traced to a blockade in another transcription factor, in this case STAT1, despite normal phosphorylation of the latter [79]. It is tempting to speculate that common mechanisms are involved, but this has by no means been established.

A recent provocative study provides a possible explanation for suppression of macrophage responses by *T. gondii* [83]. Thus, it has been suggested that tachyzoite heat shock protein (HSP)-70 may gain entry into host cell cytoplasm, and that this is responsible for preventing NFκB activity. Precedent for this model is that host HSP induction has been shown to inhibit the NFκB pathway [84]. The blocking effect of host HSP is lost after approximately 4 h, and one suggested mechanism is that HSP interferes with nuclear import. The findings recall effects of *Toxoplasma* on macrophage NFκB signaling that are also non-permanent, but involvement of parasite HSP in suppressing cytokine synthesis requires further clarification.

Several points emerge from these studies. First, and most importantly, the mechanisms underlying blockade in NFκB and STAT1 nuclear import are still essentially unknown. Second, as discussed above, *Toxoplasma*-driven IL-12 production may not require the NFκB transcription factor. In this case, inactivation of the NFκB cascade observed by us and others [81,82] may not directly relate to suppressed IL-12 production. Third, because TNF-α production remains blocked at a time when infected MΦ produce IL-12, it is necessary to invoke additional suppressive pathways that do not impinge upon signaling cascades leading to production of the latter cytokine.

Support for the concept that *Toxoplasma* employs additional immunosuppressive pathways comes from studies centered on induction of apoptosis in infected cells. In an in vivo situation, virulent *T. gondii* strains elicit high levels of apoptosis through overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines [36,37]. Nevertheless, intracellular macrophage infection results in resistance to multiple inducers of apoptosis, including IL-2 deprivation, γ irradiation and UV irradiation [85,86]. This is associated with reduced caspase activation, inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c release and down-regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase protein [87].

The degree of commonality regarding mechanisms underlying prevention of apoptosis and subversion of cytokine synthesis remains to be determined. A possible explanation for why *T. gondii* has developed mechanisms to block programmed cell death in infected cells relates to the pro-apoptotic effects of infection [36,37]. The in vitro anti-apoptotic effects of intracellular *T. gondii* infection may be a survival strategy employed by the parasite to maintain host cell viability in a milieu of pro-apoptotic mediators that can occur during infection.

Quite a different aspect of the down-regulatory effects of *Toxoplasma* infection centers on the role of lipoxin A₄ (LXA₄), an arachidonate-derived inhibitor of acute inflammation. As described above, intravenous STAg injection results in rapid production of IL-12 by splenic DC. Nevertheless, the response is short-lived and the cells become refractory to further stimulation for up to a week [88]. Mice infected with *T. gondii* during this period of DC paralysis display decreased in vivo production of inflammatory cytokines and reduced immunopathology. Induction of the refractory state in DC is mediated by LXA₄ that is produced during acute infection [89]. The lipoxin acts by down-regulating DC CCR5 expression, disabling the cells’ responsiveness to *Toxoplasma* C-18. The physiological relevance of this effect is suggested by the finding that mice deficient in 5-lipoxygenase, an enzyme required for LXA₄ synthesis, succumb to toxoplasmic encephalitis with elevated systemic levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ [90]. Lipoxins signal through binding with high affinity to FPRL-1, a G-protein-coupled receptor previously shown to bind

formylated peptides produced by bacteria. Inasmuch as CCR5 is also a G-protein-coupled receptor system, *T. gondii* infection emerges as a paradigm illustrating the concept that G-protein signaling can be involved in both positive and negative regulation of IL-12 production during microbial infection [91]. It is presently unclear if LXA₄ production represents a common down-regulatory mechanism during microbial infection, because *T. gondii* is unusual in its ability to trigger CCR5-dependent IL-12.

Another major mechanism of avoiding immunopathology during infection is through induction of IL-10, a cytokine well known for its down-regulatory effects on IL-12 synthesis. As discussed above, production of IL-10 is essential in avoiding lethal inflammatory cytokine production during infection with *Toxoplasma* and several other microbial pathogens [31,92]. Nevertheless, the cellular basis for this activity during *T. gondii* infection has not been established. While MΦ are considered an important IL-10 source, the discovery of IL-10-producing regulatory T cells raises the possibility that induction of the latter by *T. gondii* may be an important component of the immune response to infection. Indeed, in the absence of IL-10, *Helicobacter hepaticus* induces colitis that in many ways resembles disease caused by oral *T. gondii* infection [93]. For *H. hepaticus*, avoidance of pathology in the normal situation depends upon the microbe's ability to induce IL-10-producing T regulatory cells, but for *T. gondii* induction of regulatory T cells has yet to be demonstrated [94].

The combined results demonstrate that *T. gondii* possesses multiple means to down-modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Fig. 4). One class of mechanisms involves subversion of intracellular signaling cascades such as NFκB and STAT1 within infected cells. Another general tactic is by induction of soluble mediators such as LXA₄ and IL-10. While less direct, the latter strategy has the advantage of being able to act on non-infected cells. Together, the findings make it clear that *Toxoplasma* possesses a high degree of sophistication with regard to the multiple approaches employed to avoid cytokine overproduction during infection. These diverse mechanisms are likely both required to contain an otherwise runaway pro-inflammatory cytokine response leading to host death, and to prevent immune-elimination of the parasite.

### 5. Conclusions and future directions

The ability of *Toxoplasma* to simultaneously suppress and trigger innate immune function likely reflects the advantage to the parasite of inducing an immune response that is fine-tuned to achieve long-term survival of the infected host without eliminating the pathogen itself. We are beginning to gain insight into the multiple means by which this is accomplished, but the molecular mechanisms are not yet clear. However, the view that during intracellular infection the parasitophorous vacuole functions to sequence...

**Fig. 4. Intracellular and extracellular pathways of immunosuppression during *T. gondii* infection.** Intracellular infection leads to a blockade in NFκB and STAT1 activation pathways. While IkB is phosphorylated and degraded, and STAT1 undergoes phosphorylation-dependent activation, neither NFκB nor STAT1 translocate into the nucleus during early infection. As a result, production of IL-12 and TNF-α is suppressed, and expression of MHC molecules is down-regulated. *T. gondii* infection also renders cells resistant to apoptosis, as shown by reduced caspase proteolytic activation and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Extracellular pathways of immunosuppression involve *Toxoplasma*-induced host production of LXA₄ and IL-10. These soluble mediators are potent down-regulators of IL-12 production that can act on infected and non-infected cells alike.

ter the parasite from the host cell, and that intracellular communication between the two does not occur likely requires revision. Recent findings and ongoing investigations reveal that *Toxoplasma* possesses sophisticated mechanisms to instruct and subvert host cell responses from within the infected cell. An obvious way in which this could be achieved is by insertion of parasite molecules into the host cell cytoplasm. For parasite proteins such as ROP2 and GRA5, it is well established that the molecules span the parasitophorous vacuole membrane in such a way that they are partially exposed to host cell cytosol [95,96]. Tachyzoite proteins that are targeted for complete emersion into the host cell cytoplasm so far remain elusive. Identification of such molecules, and determining how they impact host cell signaling cascades, is a high-priority research area. The cellular and molecular basis of the immunology of *Toxoplasma* infection is becoming increasingly well understood, and this trend can be expected to continue in the future. This will surely provide

major insights into infection with *T. gondii* and other microbial pathogens.

TLR2 has recently been identified as a pattern recognition molecule involved in the host response to *T. gondii* (Mun et al., 2003. Internat. Immunol. 15, 1081–1087).
