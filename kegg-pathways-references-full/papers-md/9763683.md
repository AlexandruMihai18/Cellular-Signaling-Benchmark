**Xanthan gum biosynthesis and application:  
a biochemical/genetic perspective**

Received: 18 March 1998 / Received revision: 29 April 1998 / Accepted: 30 April 1998

Abstract Xanthan gum is a complex exopolysaccharide produced by the plant-pathogenic bacterium *Xanthomonas campestris* pv. campestris. It consists of D-glucosyl, D-mannosyl, and D-glucuronyl acid residues in a molar ratio of 2:2:1 and variable proportions of O-acetyl and pyruvyl residues. Because of its physical properties, it is widely used as a thickener or viscosifier in both food and non-food industries. Xanthan gum is also used as a stabilizer for a wide variety of suspensions, emulsions, and foams. This article outlines aspects of the biochemical assembly and genetic loci involved in its biosynthesis, including the synthesis of the sugar nucleotide substrates, the building and decoration of the pentasaccharide subunit, and the polymerization and secretion of the polymer. An overview of the applications and industrial production of xanthan is also covered.

sifier as a result of its unique rheological properties in industrial food and non-food sectors as well as in oil recovery. Xanthan is an acidic polymer made up of pentasaccharide subunits, forming a cellulose backbone with trisaccharide side-chains composed of mannose(β1,4)glucuronic-acid(β1,2)mannose attached to alternate glucose residues in the backbone by α1,3 linkages (Jansson et al. 1975, Fig. 1). On approximately half of the terminal mannose residues a pyruvic acid moiety is joined by a ketal linkage. Acetyl groups are often present as 6-O substituents on the internal mannose residues. Some external mannoses contain a second 6-O-acetyl substituent (Stankowsky et al. 1993). The levels of pyruvate and acetyl substitution vary with bacterial growth conditions and other parameters. Here we summarize our current knowledge of the genetics and biochemistry of xanthan biosynthesis as well as of the industrial production and applications of xanthan.

### Introduction

*Xanthomonas campestris* pv. campestris is a plant-pathogenic bacterium that produces the exopolysaccharide xanthan. Many other pathovars of *X. campestris* efficiently produce exopolysaccharides, including the pathovars phaseoli, malvaeorum, carotae, citrumelo, juglandis, as well as some other members of the genus *Xanthomonas* (*X. fragariae*, *X. oryzae* pv. *oryzae*). Xanthan has attracted particular attention because it has found many applications as a thickener and emul-

### Biochemistry and genetics of xanthan biosynthesis

Xanthan is built up from cytoplasmic sugar nucleotides, acetyl-CoA, and phosphoenolpyruvate with an inner-membrane polyisoprenol phosphate as an acceptor (Ielpi et al. 1981, 1983, 1993). The elucidation of its biosynthetic pathway has been greatly aided by using *X. campestris* campestris cells frozen and thawed several times in the presence of EDTA. The stepwise assembly of the repeating pentasaccharide and the polymerization process were resolved by incubating these permeabilized cells with combinations of UDP-glucose, GDP-mannose, and UDP-glucuronic acid. The synthesis of the repeating unit starts with the transfer of glucosyl 1-phosphate from UDP-glucose to polyisoprenol phosphate, followed by the sequential transfer of the other sugar residues to form the complete repeating unit. Acetyl and pyruvyl residues are added at the lipid-linked pentasaccharide level, donated by acetyl-CoA and phosphoenolpyruvate respectively. The examination of

the polymerization process indicated that xanthan chains grow at the reducing end (Ielpi et al. 1993), as described for Wzy-dependent (formerly Rfc-dependent) $O$-antigen synthesis (Whitfield 1995). The export mechanism of the polysaccharide remains to be determined but it might be associated to the polymerization event.

Many of the genetic methods used to study *Escherichia coli* can be used in *X. campestris* campestris, including conjugation, electroporation, chemical and transposon mutagenesis, and site-directed mutagenesis. The isolation of a collection of non-mucoid mutants defective in xanthan production, developed by chemical mutagenesis or by transposon mutagenesis (Barrère et al. 1986; Capage et al. 1987; Harding et al. 1987; Thorne et al. 1987; Hötte et al. 1990; Harding et al. 1993) revealed several genetic loci involved in xanthan biosynthesis.

Regions termed $xpsIII$, $xpsIV$ and $xpsVI$ (Harding et al. 1993) as well as a 35.3-kb gene cluster (Hötte et al. 1990) contain several genes required for the biosynthesis of sugar nucleotides necessary for both xanthan and lipopolysaccharide production. The 35.3-kb gene cluster comprises two separate regions, one of which overlaps the $xpsIII$ region. The DNA sequence of a common segment of these sequences revealed two genes, designated $xanA$ and $xanB$ (Köplin et al. 1992). While the $xanA$ gene encodes an enzyme with phosphoglucomutase and phosphomannomutase activities, $xanB$ codes for a bifunctional enzyme with phosphomannose isomerase and GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase activities (Fig. 2). Thus, a portion of this region encodes two enzymes, one of which is required for the synthesis of all three sugar nucleotide precursors of xanthan, and the other for the synthesis of GDP-mannose. Genetic and biochemical analyses showed that mutations mapping in the $xpsIV$ region affect the activity of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase enzyme, whereas $xpsVI$ mutations totally abolished UDP-glucose dehydrogenase levels (Harding et al. 1993) (Fig. 2). Genes encoding these activities were recently sequenced (Lin et al. 1995; Wei et al. 1996). Mutants mapping in all these regions exhibit the same phenotype: they do not produce xanthan in vivo, but did produce the polyisoprenyl diphosphate pentasaccharide and polymer when sugar nucleotides were added in the in vitro system (Harding et al. 1993).

The genes required for lipid-linked intermediate assembly, polymerization, and secretion have been isolated and sequenced (Harding et al. 1987; Capage et al. 1987). They are clustered in a 16-kb region, termed $xpsI$ or $gum$ (Fig. 3). Unlike other exopolysaccharide biosynthetic systems, this region is unlinked from those required for the synthesis of sugar nucleotide precursors (Becker et al. 1997; Canter Cremers et al. 1990; Roberts 1996; Yamazaki et al. 1996). Nucleotide sequence analysis predicted the presence of 12 open reading frames ($gumB$ to $gumM$) (Fig. 3; Capage et al. 1987; Becker et al. 1995; GenBank accession number U22511). The transcriptional organization of the $gum$ region was analysed through $gum-lacZ$ transcriptional fusions and primer-extension assays (Katzen et al. 1996). These analyses indicated that the $gum$ region is expressed as a single operon from a promoter located upstream of the first gene, $gumB$. A second promoter was identified upstream of $gumK$.

The biochemical functions of the $gum$ gene products have been assigned by analysing the in vitro formation of lipid-linked biosynthetic intermediates and polymers employing permeabilized cells of $gum$ mutant strains. Much of this work has appeared as patents, abstracts, symposia papers, personal communications, or book chapters with the data being generally accepted but not always having been experimentally proven, or described

in the scientific literature. Since the biosynthesis and genetics of xanthan are used as a model system for other exopolysaccharides, we decided to obtain our own set of mutants in each of the *gum* genes, and analysed them using the in vitro system (Katzen et al. 1998). Figure 2 summarizes the proposed *gum* gene functions. The GumD protein catalyses the addition of glucose 1-phosphate to the polyisoprenol phosphate carrier. This reversible reaction is the first step in the biosynthesis of lipid-linked intermediates involved in the synthesis of xanthan. GumM catalyses the addition of a β1,4-glucose, followed by the addition of the internal α1,3-mannose by GumH, a β1,2-glucuronic acid by GumK, and the terminal β1,4-mannose by GumI. The GumL protein incorporates pyruvyl residues to the external β-mannose, while the acetyl residues are incorporated into the internal α-mannose by GumF, and into the external β-mannose by GumG.

In addition to the polyisoprenyl diphosphate pentasaccharide, the lipid-linked trisaccharide is able to act as a substrate for GumF. However, the lipid-linked acetyl trisaccharide cannot act as an acceptor of a glucuronic acid residue, suggesting that the acetyl residues are incorporated into the polymer via the lipid-linked repeating unit (Ielpi and Dankert, unpublished data).

Most of the *gum* genes could be disrupted within the wild-type strain. However, *gumB*, *gumC*, *gumE*, *gumM*, and *gumJ* genes could only be mutated by using a UDP-glucose-defective strain since their inactivation in a wild-type background appeared to be lethal (Katzen et al. 1996, 1998). Unexpectedly, the first step in the assembly of the lipid-linked intermediate was severely affected in these double mutants. This deficiency could be recovered by the introduction of a plasmid carrying the coding region for the C-terminal domain of GumD, which appeared to be responsible of its glucosyl-1-phosphate transferase activity (Katzen et al. 1998; Ferreiro and Ielpi, unpublished data). These results suggest a possible regulatory role for the GumD protein, or that a balanced expression of one or more proteins is required for the proper expression of the GumD activity. This may be of particular significance if GumD interacts with another protein(s). Since *gumB*, *gumC*, and *gumE* strains appear to accumulate complete xanthan subunits in vitro and are unable to synthesize polymer, the products

of these genes may be needed for polymerization or export of the polymer. Although the function of the *gumJ* product cannot be associated with a particular gum-biosynthetic step, a secretion role for GumJ can not be ruled out. Alternatively it might be necessary for preventing accumulation of a harmful product or for recycling essential substrates.

### Regulation of xanthan synthesis

To date, most of what is known about regulation of xanthan synthesis derives from phytopathogenicity studies. No specific controls of xanthan synthesis have been reported. A *X. campestris* campestris *clp* (cap-like protein) mutant showed reduced pathogenicity and decreased production of xanthan and some extracellular enzymes (de Crécy-Lagard et al. 1990). Synthesis of these and other extracellular enzymes and xanthan is activated by the products of a cluster of at least five genes, designated *rpf* (regulation of pathogenicity factors; Tang et al. 1991). The sequence of one of these genes, *rpfC*, showed homology to members of the two-component class of regulatory proteins. These factors appear to be balanced by at least one unlinked gene that negatively regulates the synthesis of the extracellular enzymes and xanthan (Tang et al. 1990). Although xanthan gum is not essential for plant virulence (Katzen et al. 1998), initial stages of its biosynthesis, seem to be regulated as a part of a pathogenicity regulon (Coplin and Cook 1990). Few promoters and transcription start sites have been characterized in different pathovars of *X. campestris* to date (Knoop et al. 1991; Kingsley et al. 1993; Katzen et al. 1996). The identification of promoter regions involved in the first stages of xanthan production will be the basis for further studies on *gum* gene regulation.

### Industrial production of xanthan

*X. campestris* campestris can use a broad range of carbon and nitrogen sources. Xanthan is usually produced by fermentation of *X. campestris* campestris strains with glucose, sucrose, starch, acid or enzymic hydrolysates of starch, molasse or corn syrup as the major carbon source in batch cultures. As nitrogen source casein hydrolysates, soybean meal, yeast hydrolysates or distillers solubles are frequently used. In continuous fermentation, there are problems of maintaining sterility and the risk
of the emergence of fast-growing mutants that do not produce the desired product xanthan. In batch cultures xanthan is produced to some extent in all growth phases. The maximum production was observed in the exponential growth phase (Thorne et al. 1987; Sutherland 1993). Different growth phases and alterations of the growth medium, for example by using different substrates and limiting nutrients, do not influence the primary structure, but do affect the degree of decoration, the molecular mass and the yield of xanthan. Therefore, the xanthan product recovered from a batch culture represents a mixture of xanthan produced in the different growth phases and may vary with different culture conditions (Davidson 1978; Slodki and Cadmus 1978; Tait et al. 1986; Suh et al. 1990; Peters et al. 1993). Depending on the production strain and the substrates used in batch cultures, approximately 10–25 xanthan/ laccumulates in the culture supernatant after 48–72 h (Harding et al. 1987; Thorne et al. 1987; Pollock and Thorne 1994). In continuous cultures, high conversion rates of substrate to polymer of 60%–70% were observed (Jarman and Pace 1984). The production of xanthan is promoted by a high ratio of carbon to nitrogen in the substrate. In ammonia-deficient media a high xanthan production was observed (Davidson 1978; Tait et al. 1986). Souw and Demain (1979) reported that sucrose is a better substrate for xanthan production than glucose and pyruvate. They also found that succinate and 2-oxoglutarate have stimulatory effects on xanthan production in sucrose-based medium. Davidson (1978) demonstrated that magnesium or phosphate limitation results in the production of xanthan with a low pyruvate content.

One of the major problems in the industrial production of xanthan is the growing viscosity of the culture during fermentation, which affects the availability of oxygen and nutrients. *X*. campestris campestris strains are strictly aerobic. Therefore, the oxygen-transfer rate also affects the xanthan yield. Moreover, Suh et al. (1990) reported that the molecular mass of xanthan decreases under oxygen limitation.

Owing to the growing viscosity during fermentation, suitable aeration and mixing of the culture have to be guaranteed to avoid stagnant areas (Nakajima et al. 1990; Amallah et al. 1998). Therefore, mechanically agitated fermentation tanks instead of air-agitated tanks are usually used for the industrial production of xanthan.

The separation of the cells from the highly viscous xanthan solution is a cost-intensive process in the industrial production (Homma et al. 1997; Murofushi et al. 1997). Nowadays, the favoured method for recovering xanthan from the fermentation liquid is a precipitation with alcohol, mostly isopropanol, after pasteurization to destroy bacterial cells and enzymes (Cottrell and Kang 1978). Subsequently the xanthan precipitate is spray-dried and milled to a powder. The alcohol is recovered by distillation. Concentrates containing approximately 10% xanthan for industrial non-food applications are obtained by tangential-flow filtration (Lee 1981).

Antibacterial agents are added to the concentrates to stabilize the product. Enzymatic degradation of xanthan is used to alter the rheological properties of the product (Hou and Barnabe 1987; Ahlgren 1991, 1993, 1995; Cadmus and Slodki 1991).

Strains for xanthan production were selected and improved by conventional methods. Recently, more attention has been paid to genetic techniques to develop strains with altered xanthan production. Several efforts have been made to simplify the repeating unit structure by mutation of specific genes involved in the synthesis of xanthan, but the xanthan yield from these mutants was much lower as than that from the wild-type strains. Betlach et al. (1987) constructed a mutant that produced xanthan lacking the glucuronic acid residues and the pyruvate decoration. Solutions of this xanthan derivative were highly viscous. A plasmid that carried a part of the *gum* gene region was introduced into *X*. *campestris* campestris (Harding et al. 1987). The resulting strain produced xanthan with an enhanced pyruvate content. Mutants that produced xanthan containing no pyruvate were isolated by Wernau (1979, 1980) and Hassler and Doherty (1990). Another strategy to alter the structure of xanthan is the postsynthetic enzymatic treatment of xanthan, such as the removal of the terminal β-D-glucuronosyl residue from xanthan missing the mannosyl side-chain terminus (Tait and Sutherland 1989). This truncated xanthan missing the terminal disaccharide was more viscous than the original xanthan (Betlach et al. 1987; Tait and Sutherland 1989).

The possibility of achieving a considerable increase of the xanthan yield by the construction of new strains seems to be unlikely, since (like the synthesis of many other bacterial polysaccharides) the synthetic process for xanthan production is very efficient because of a high conversion rate from the carbon substrates (Linton 1990). Therefore, an improvement of the xanthan yield and quality has mainly been achieved through improved fermenter design and through changes in the composition of the medium. Nevertheless, attempts have been made to extend the range of substrates efficiently used for xanthan biosynthesis. *X*. *campestris* campestris does not use lactose efficiently as a carbon source because of the low level of β-galactosidase activity. Therefore, whey is not a suitable carbon source for xanthan production. Fu and Tseng (1990) introduced a plasmid carrying a β-galactosidase-encoding gene into *X*. *campestris* campestris. The resulting strain was able to produce xanthan in whey-containing medium, but the plasmid was not maintained stably without selective pressure. Genetic methods are also a desirable approach to eliminate unwanted products from the production strains. New strains may help to improve the recovery and purification of xanthan. Xanthan-producing strains synthesize several extracellular enzymes such as cellulases (Gough et al. 1988, 1990), which can degrade xanthan in its disordered form (Sutherland 1984): xanthan is often added to products that contain cellulose or derivatives thereof. These enzymes are destroyed by heat treatmentor chemical treatment that involves the use of propylene oxide or propionolactone (Empey and Pettitt 1978). The construction of mutants lacking these enzymes can simplify the recovery and purification process.

### Applications of xanthan

Although only a few microbial exopolysaccharides are commercially available, xanthan is already a well-established product. To date, more than 1600 patents on production and applications of xanthan have been registered in the USA alone. Nevertheless, other polysaccharides from plant origin, e.g., alginate, cellulose, starch, arabic gum, and guar gum, or from bacterial origin, e.g., alginate (Rehm and Valla 1997), pullulan (Tsujisaka and Mitsuhashi 1993), gellan (Pollock 1993) and acetan (Jansson et al. 1993), compete with xanthan. Xanthan was approved for food use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1969 and received approval from the European Union under the E-number 415 in 1980. No acceptable daily intake value was fixed for xanthan and it was approved *quantum satis*. Worldwide, 10,000–20,000 tonnes of xanthan per year are commercially produced. The success of xanthan as the major commercially produced microbial polysaccharide is based on the following important rheological properties. Solutions of xanthan have a high viscosity at low concentrations and they are pseudoplastic (Rinaudo and Milas 1978; Milas and Rinaudo 1986; Richardson and Ross-Murphy 1987; Nolte et al. 1992). Moreover, xanthan is insensitive to a broad range of temperature, pH, and electrolyte concentrations (Lambert and Rinaudo 1985; Hatakenaka et al. 1987; Kierulf and Sutherland 1988). It also displays a high shear stability (Chen and Sheppard 1980). Because of these properties, xanthan has found a broad range of applications in the oil, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, paper, paint, and textile industries (Table 1; Sandvik and Maerker 1977; Brandford and Baird 1983; Sutherland 1993). In these applications, it is mainly used as a gelling and suspending agent, as a flocculant, or for viscosity control. Xanthan is also used in the food industry (Table 1; Brandford and Baird 1983; Sutherland 1993). It is mainly added as a stabilizing, thickening, gelling, and emulsifying agent, but it is also used as an adhesive and for the inhibition of ice-crystal formation.

### Perspectives

Bacterial exopolysaccharides like xanthan provide an alternative to polysaccharides of plant origin. However, bacterial polysaccharide products are relatively expensive in comparison to the bulk plant polysaccharides, such as alginate originating from plants and starch. One advantage of xanthan is that the quality of this bacterial product can be ensured by the use of specific production strains and by the fermentation conditions. To strengthen the position of xanthan in the polysaccharide market, the physiology and regulation of the production process have to be investigated, and new applications have to be established. The commercial success of xanthan is not only based on its rheological properties, but also on economic factors. *X. campestris* campestris can use a broad range of different substrates. The substrate conversion rate is high, and recovery and conversion of xanthan to the final product are simple and therefore relatively cheap. The elimination of unwanted byproducts by genetic modifications of the production strains may simplify the recovery of xanthan from the fermentation liquid. New xanthan derivatives with useful properties seem to be difficult to achieve. Decorations or the side-chain may be subject to modifications. Chemical modifications or genetic methods may result in xanthan derivatives with new rheological properties. New applications for such specific products can be discovered in the growing sector of sustainable resources or in the pharmaceutical sector. A new field of applications may be identified for specific oligosaccharides derived from xanthan. More research will be necessary to improve the production of specifically modified xanthan derivatives, to predict and characterize their rheological properties, and to identify new applications.
