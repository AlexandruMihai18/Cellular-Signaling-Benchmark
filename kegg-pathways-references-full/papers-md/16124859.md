Key Words hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomypathy, PRKAG2 cardiomyopathy

■ Abstract Cardiomyopathies are primary disorders of cardiac muscle associated with abnormalities of cardiac wall thickness, chamber size, contraction, relaxation, conduction, and rhythm. They are a major cause of morbidity and mortality at all ages and, like acquired forms of cardiovascular disease, often result in heart failure. Over the past two decades, molecular genetic studies of humans and analyses of model organisms have made remarkable progress in defining the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can result from mutations in 11 genes that encode sarcomere proteins, and dilated cardiomyopathy is caused by mutations at 25 chromosome loci where genes encoding contractile, cytoskeletal, and calcium regulatory proteins have been identified. Causes of cardiomyopathies associated with clinically important cardiac arrhythmias have also been discovered: Mutations in cardiac metabolic genes cause hypertrophy in association with ventricular pre-excitation and mutations causing arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia were recently discovered in protein constituents of desmosomes. This considerable genetic heterogeneity suggests that there are multiple pathways that lead to changes in heart structure and function. Defects in myocyte force generation, force transmission, and calcium homeostasis have emerged as particularly critical signals driving these pathologies. Delineation of the cell and molecular events triggered by cardiomyopathy gene mutations provide new fundamental knowledge about myocyte biology and organ physiology that accounts for cardiac remodeling and defines mechanistic pathways that lead to heart failure.

INTRODUCTION

The structure of the normal heart is exquisitely adapted to pump blood through two independent vascular systems, the pulmonary and the systemic circulations. The thin-walled right atrium and the left atrium accept blood returning from the systemic circulation and the pulmonary circulation, respectively. During diastole (cardiac relaxation), blood flows from the atria into the muscular ventricles.
systole (cardiac contraction), the right ventricle and the left ventricle pump blood into pulmonary and systemic circulations, respectively.

Heart failure is a chronic and progressive disorder characterized by impaired cardiac contraction (systolic dysfunction) and/or relaxation (diastolic dysfunction). Heart failure poses a 1 in 5 lifetime risk in both men and women (84) and is the most common cause of death in industrialized societies (101). This emerging cardiovascular epidemic imposes a significant burden on quality of life and on health care systems; heart failure treatments cost more than $17 billion annually, and with an aging population these socioeconomic costs will likely increase (164).

Heart failure is virtually always a secondary entity that occurs when the myocardial function is diminished by an underlying condition such as cardiomyopathy (primary or acquired from chronic ischemia, hypertension, or diabetes), valve disease, congenital malformation, or rhythm disturbances. In response to these initiating insults, the intermediate and long-term response of the heart is morphologic remodeling in association with hemodynamic changes. The two major and distinct cardiac remodeling patterns that are clinically recognized are cardiac hypertrophy or dilation. Classical definition of these morphologies is based on anatomic findings. However, the pervasive use of cardiac evaluation by echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging has changed the clinical diagnosis of cardiac hypertrophy or dilation from histopathologic findings to noninvasive assessment of ventricular dimensions and function.

Hypertrophy is defined by anatomic findings of increased cardiac muscle mass, which results from increased wall thickness, due to enlarged cardiac myocytes and/or increased myocardial interstitial fibrosis. When diagnosed by echocardiography, hypertrophy is defined by increased ventricular wall thickness that occurs with preserved systolic but impaired diastolic function. Anatomical findings associated with cardiac dilation also include increased cardiac mass, but this primarily reflects enlarged cardiac chamber volumes, as well as modest increases in ventricular wall thickness, due to enlarged myocytes and increased cardiac fibrosis. Noninvasive imaging studies of dilated hearts show diminished contractile performance, with primarily decreased systolic function. Although anatomic and hemodynamic parameters distinguish hypertrophic from dilated remodeling, both entities can lead to cardiac decompensation and heart failure. As this end phase emerges, hemodynamic distinctions between these pathologies become less prominent and both systolic and diastolic defects are found in heart failure.

Hypertrophy is most often recognized as the predominant and sustained response to disorders that increase the load on the heart, such as what occurs with hypertension. Ventricular dilation is the response to disorders that produce volume overload, such what occurs following myocardial infarction. These distinct cardiac morphologies also occur in primary cardiomyopathies that are caused by single gene defects. Although the precise relationship between genetic and acquired hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy is not completely understood, knowledge about the cellular and molecular pathways triggered by gene defects is expected to be informative to remodeling that results from pressure or volume overload.The morphology of the heart is predicated on cardiac myocyte number and function. Terminally differentiated cardiac myocytes lack any replicative capacity, and throughout life these cells respond to stress principally by increasing in size (myocyte hypertrophy) or by prematurely dying. Myocyte death triggers an increase in the number of cardiac fibroblasts as well as increases in interstitial matrix or collectively termed cardiac fibrosis. When myocytes are hypertrophied, there is an increase in the number of longitudinally arranged sarcomeres, the functional unit of contraction within all muscle cells (Figure 1). The sarcomere is an immense protein complex that is organized into thick and thin filaments, which, in the presence of calcium and ATP, slide past one another and thereby generate contractile force. When intracellular calcium levels rise in response to cellular electrical depolarization, calcium binds to the troponin complex, composed of troponins C, I, and T, and α-tropomyosin, and releases troponin I inhibition of actin-myosin interactions. The myosin head then binds to actin, ATP binds to myosin, the myosin head is displaced along the thin filament, ATP hydrolysis occurs, and force is generated. During depolarization, a small amount of calcium enters the myocyte via voltage-gated L-type calcium channels and the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger. This influx of calcium triggers greater calcium release from the stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptors and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors in a process termed calcium-induced calcium release. During relaxation, calcium is removed from the cytosol by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA2a), the sarcolemmal Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger, the sarcolemmal Ca²⁺-ATPase, and the mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uniporter. Thus, calcium is a critical molecule regulating both cardiac contraction and relaxation.

Force generated during contraction is transmitted outward to the cytoskeleton through a complex network of proteins that link the sarcomere to the sarcolemma and the extracellular matrix (Figure 1). This cytoskeleton is formed from an intermyofibrillar layer comprised of intermediate filaments, desmin, microfilaments (consisting of nonsarcomeric actin), microtubules, and subsarcolemmal components. In addition, lamin proteins comprise intermediate filaments associated with the nucleoplasmic surface of the inner nuclear membrane.

Costameres are subsarcolemmal complexes that interconnect the various intermyofibrillar cytoskeleton networks and link them to the sarcolemma. There are three types of costameres—the focal adhesion-type complex, composed of proteins such as vinculin, talin, tensin, paxillin, zyxin, and α- and β-integrins; the spectrin-based complex, composed of actin, ankyrin, and desmin; and the dystrophin-associated complex, composed of dystrophin, α- and β-dystroglycans, α-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans, dystrobrevin, and syntrophin. Structural and functional integrity between adjacent myocytes is supported by desmosomes, multiprotein structures composed of cadherins, plakophilins, and plakins. In addition to supporting organ architecture, these complexes may transmit force between cells and participate in signal transduction pathways.

Mutations in genes that encode many of these important proteins, which subserve overall heart function, cause primary cardiomyopathies. Prior to the
elucidation of underlying genetic causes, these disorders were considered “idiopathic” because they remodel ventricular morphology in the absence of conditions that produce pressure or volume overload. Primary cardiomyopathies are classified based on morphologic patterns of hypertrophic or dilated remodeling. Although these classifications provide an appropriate anatomic label, unfortunately they fail to reflect new knowledge about the molecular mechanisms that trigger changes in heart structure and function—information that ultimately should enable novel therapeutic approaches. For example, cardiac hypertrophy can be triggered by sarcomere gene mutations (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) or by metabolic gene defects (glycogen storage cardiomyopathies). Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is used to indicate ventricular remodeling that occurs in isolation (due to gene mutations affecting contractile or calcium cycling proteins), in association with electrophysiologic deficits (due to gene mutations affecting a nuclear membrane protein or desmosome proteins) or in association with skeletal muscle disease (due to gene mutations in cytoskeletal proteins). Newer nomenclature that more accurately links morphologic subtypes of cardiac remodeling with molecular mechanisms is needed for cardiomyopathies. The impetus for precisely defining the genetic causes of cardiomyopathy is threefold. First, these are important medical disorders that produce substantial morbidity and mortality. Second, the anatomic and hemodynamic changes associated with these disorders are also observed in acquired forms of heart disease and heart failure. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies will likely also shed light on the pathogenesis of acquired and complex genetic cardiac disorders. Third, genetic cardiomyopathies have enormous potential to provide new knowledge about myocyte cell biology. Insights into the mechanisms by which myocytes adapt to abnormalities in excitation, biomechanics of contraction and force transmission, and metabolism should yield clues about how exquisitely developed, ceaselessly working cells maintain lifelong capacities.

# HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY

With a prevalence of 200 per 100,000 individuals, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common cardiovascular disease inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (89). The overall annual mortality rate associated with HCM is only 1%, but certain subsets of patients have much higher mortality rates of 6%. Death may be sudden and unexpected or may occur secondary to stroke or progressive heart failure. In the United States, HCM accounts for 36% of all sudden deaths in competitive athletes under the age of 35 years (90).

HCM is characterized by left ventricular wall thickening, which is often asymmetric, and particularly involves the interventricular septum (Figure 2B). Histopathological examination demonstrates myocytes that are hypertrophied and disarrayed (a term indicating bizarrely shaped cells that are disoriented with respect to one another) and interspersed between increased cardiac fibrosis (Figure 2E,H).

Noninvasive imaging that reveals unexplained cardiac hypertrophy with preserved systolic function often prompts a diagnosis of HCM. However, molecular genetic investigations have defined several distinct causes for hypertrophic remodeling.

Hundreds of mutations in 11 genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM (Table 1; Figure 3) (144, 156). β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7), myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3), cardiac troponin I (TNNI3), and cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) are the most prevalent disease genes, but mutations have also been found in α-tropomyosin (TPM1), cardiac actin (ACTC), cardiac troponin C (TNNC1), essential myosin light chain (MYL3), regulatory myosin light chain (MYL2), α-cardiac myosin heavy chain (MYH6), and titin (TTN). Comprehensive genetic analyses of these genes yield definition of a disease-causing mutation in approximately 70% of HCM cases. Although it is likely that some of the remaining cases are due to mutations in other sarcomere protein genes, recent data indicate that different genetic etiologies can clinically mimic HCM (2, 14, 49).

Genetic heterogeneity in HCM accounts for some phenotypic diversity observed in patients (180, 181). The age at onset of clinical findings, disease penetrance, severity of cardiac hypertrophy, and risk of sudden cardiac death are in part due to the precise disease-causing HCM mutation. An early model to account for how different clinical features might result from mutations in the same gene suggested that defects located within the same functional protein domain would produce similar phenotypes. However, MYH7 mutations found in the head domain that are predicted to alter the actin-binding surface, the nucleotide-binding pocket, the hinge region, or the α-helical tail near the essential myosin light chain binding site (Figure 3) (141) can have either comparable or markedly different clinical

phenotypes. For example, the Arg403Gln and Arg719Trp mutations in $MYH7$ are associated with particularly severe hypertrophy and predispose to sudden death and heart failure, whereas the Phe513Cys, Leu908Val, and Gly256Glu mutations cause less severe phenotypes (146, 147, 154). In addition, recently identified rare mutations within the myosin rod (15) appear to be clinically indistinguishable from other myosin mutations.

A more precise definition of the influence of genotype on phenotype comes from genetically engineered models carrying human mutations (see below). The amount of mutant protein expressed within the heart influences clinical expression. Patients who are homozygous for a mutation (58) or are compound heterozygotes have more hypertrophy and a poorer prognosis than do patients who have one mutant allele and one normal allele (144, 145).

Clinical variance in disease manifestations is also reflected by mutations in different HCM genes. $MYH7$ mutations usually cause more hypertrophy than other disease genes. $TNNT2$ defects that produce only mild hypertrophy are associated with overall higher incidences of sudden cardiac death than other HCM genes. Whereas hypertrophy in individuals with $MYH7$ mutations is usually present in the first two decades of life, hypertrophic remodeling by $MYBPC3$ mutations can be delayed until after the fifth or sixth decades (113). Several mutations have been associated with unusual patterns of cardiac hypertrophy, including left ventricular apical hypertrophy in $TNNI3$ mutations (69) and midcavity hypertrophy in $ACTC$ (118) and $MYL3$ (131) mutations. However, these same gene mutations also cause typical patterns of hypertrophy in other members of the same family, indicating that genotype alone does not account for all morphologic features of ventricular remodeling (39, 69, 105).

The inter-relationship between disease-causing mutations, background genotypes, lifestyles, and hypertrophic remodeling has been investigated in animal models of HCM. Regular strenuous exercise augments hypertrophic remodeling and provokes sudden death in mouse models of HCM (44), thereby providing justification for recommending avoidance of competitive athletics for affected human patients. Remarkably, gender may influence disease progression in HCM. A transgenic HCM mouse model shows progressive heart failure development in male but not female littermates (123), and clinical human studies suggest that affected women have less ventricular dilation and later onset of disease, but a higher incidence of stroke (34, 35, 91).

Modifying genes also may affect phenotypic expression of HCM mutations. A tentative association was reported between the DD variant of angiotensin-1 converting enzyme and the extent of hypertrophy and sudden cardiac death (78, 87). However, analyses of polymorphisms in genes encoding other components of the renin-angiotensin system, aldosterone, endothelin, and tumor necrosis factor, have been inconclusive (22, 32, 125, 126, 128, 171). The presence of a modifying genetic locus that attenuates hypertrophic remodeling was also demonstrated in a murine model of HCM due to the $Myh6$ Arg403Gln mutation (158), but the gene remains unknown. Identifying this modifying factor and others may be

important for defining opportunities to ameliorate hypertrophic remodeling in HCM patients.

Cellular and molecular events triggered by sarcomere protein gene mutations that lead to HCM remain incompletely defined. Dominant gene mutations generally produce disease by inactivating an allele, resulting in a diminution of functional protein (haploinsufficiency), or alternatively by creating a mutant protein that either interferes with normal function (dominant negative) or assumes a new function. Evidence from genetically engineered animal models that carry human mutations primarily support the latter mechanisms for causing remodeling in HCM. Biophysical studies of HCM mutant proteins discovered altered crossbridge kinetics of thin and thick filaments in the sarcomere and differences in actomyosin interactions. These studies demonstrate an increase in calcium sensitivity resulting in proportional increases in tension generation and ATPase activity at a given calcium concentration in HCM mutations affecting myosin, troponin T, C, and I or myosin light chain proteins (13, 33, 37, 55–57, 71, 72, 76, 99, 106, 127, 142, 149, 167, 168, 170, 182). HCM mutations may also lead to inefficient use of ATP at the myofilament level, a result that suggests that energy requirements of HCM myocytes may be greater than normal cells. In addition, some myosin mutations exhibit increases in maximum power output, enhanced ATPase activity, and increased actin sliding velocities—all suggesting that these defects create a gain in myosin function.

Several models predict how altered, and potentially enhanced, biophysical properties of individual sarcomere proteins cause hypertrophic remodeling. First, heterogeneity of mutant and wild-type proteins within the sarcomere may disrupt coordination of the intricate association between individual myosins and actin, and inhomogeneous mechanical events may compromise overall sarcomere function. Second, either because a mutation directly affects ATPase activity or because of indirect mechanisms, energy requirements of myocytes containing sarcomere mutations will likely increase. Furthermore, once remodeling occurs at the cellular level (with increased sarcomere content) energy demands by the whole organ also increase. Because such myocytes within the hypertrophied heart are at considerable risk for ischemia, unmet metabolic demands can result in premature myocyte death and replacement fibrosis within the heart. Studies of cardiac muscle from several murine HCM models are consistent with this hypothesis. Mutations in *Mhy6*, *Mybp3*, *Tnnt2*, or *Tnni3* demonstrated that enhanced contractile function occurs at the cost of increased work (16, 23, 102, 176). Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of the murine model of the Arg403Gln mutation in *Mhy6* have reduced basal energy stores and unfavorable ATP/ADP ratios, which may further decrease free energy release from ATP hydrolysis (127, 143, 163, 176).

Engineered animal models carrying a sarcomere protein gene mutation have provided reagents to discover the mechanisms by which mutant sarcomeres produce signals that result in hypertrophic remodeling. Although there may be distinct signals triggered by different mutant sarcomere proteins with different biophysical functions during contraction and relaxation, calcium has emerged as a critical and common key agent implicated in this process.

Calcium cycling between the sarcomere and sarcoplasmic reticulum is altered in HCM. The maximum calcium released from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores is significantly diminished in myocytes with the Arg403Gln $Mhy6$ mutation (41). In addition, the levels of the calcium-binding sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins calsequestrin and junctin, and of the ryanodine receptor calcium channel, are decreased in these mice (157). When HCM mice are treated with the L-type calcium channel inhibitor diltiazem in advance of an established hypertrophic myocardium, normal levels of calsequestrin, junctin, and ryanodine receptor are restored, and development of the histopathologic changes of HCM is diminished.

Changes in myocyte calcium cycling can help to explain the pathophysiology of human HCM (110). Patients with $MYH7$ and $MYBPC3$ mutations exhibit decreased diastolic velocities compared with control subjects even prior to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (111). Impaired diastolic relaxation is likely due to the increase in calcium sensitivity observed at the cellular and the molecular levels in animal models. Whether calcium cycling also contributes to changes in systolic function observed in hypertrophic remodeling is unknown.

Only a few of the downstream events occurring in response to calcium signals and increased energy demands have been identified. Several transcription factors including myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2), GATA4, and serum response factor (SRF) interact to control stress-induced fetal gene reactivation, which characterizes hypertrophy in the adult heart (117). The activity of these transcription factors depends on their ability to associate with histone acetyltransferases (HATs). These HATs transfer acetyl groups from acetyl CoA to $\varepsilon-$amino groups of lysine residues in nucleosomal histone tails, which promote chromatin relaxation and facilitate local gene transcription. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are endogenous inhibitors of HATs. Class II HDACs inhibit MEF2 activity and appear to repress cardiac hypertrophy. When phosphorylated, they are exported from the nucleus, allowing MEF2 to activate downstream genes that drive hypertrophy. Mice lacking class II HDACs demonstrate exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy in response to various stressors (24, 187). In contrast, class I HDACs appear to inhibit SRF activity, thereby inhibiting its repression of cardiac hypertrophy. Although a role for HDACs has been established in load-induced cardiac hypertrophy (94), the relevance of these transcriptional modulators in hypertrophy due to sarcomere gene mutations remains to be determined.

On the basis of early insights into the pathogenesis of HCM, a few novel therapeutic agents have been tested in animal models. As noted above, the calcium channel blocker diltiazem attenuated myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis in mice with an Arg403Gln mutation in $Myh6$ (157). Angiotensin II has been implicated in both promoting myocyte hypertrophy and increasing cardiac fibrosis. The angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan (83) and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin, which both inhibit load-induced cardiac hypertrophy, may ameliorate HCM by reducing the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (129) through reduction of levels of activated ERK1/2, a prominent cardiac stress-response kinase. Therapeutic interventions in the various mouse models of HCM

suggest possible novel avenues for reducing hypertrophic development in humans with sarcomere gene mutations.

# GLYCOGEN CARDIOMYOPATHY

A distinct subset of cardiomyopathies occurs due to mutations in genes encoding metabolic proteins. Glycogen deposition is a shared feature of these metabolic cardiomyopathies. Prior to elucidation of the genetic etiology of these disorders, many of the glycogen cardiomyopathies were mistakenly classified as HCM. However, unlike cardiomyopathies due to sarcomere gene mutations, glycogen storage disorders usually present with electrophysiologic deficits, and chronically affected individuals develop more systolic dysfunction than occurs with sarcomere gene mutations. Histopathologic findings also distinguish these two genetic forms of cardiac hypertrophy. Whereas myocyte and myofibrillar disarray, myocyte hypertrophy, and cardiac fibrosis are characteristic of mutations in sarcomeric proteins, these features are notably absent in glycogen storage cardiomyopathies. Rather, myocyte vacuoles containing glycogen are found in hypertrophied hearts with metabolic gene mutations (Figure 2J) (4).

Human mutations in three lysosome proteins produce cardiac hypertrophy: Pompe disease [recessively inherited lysosomal acid α 1,4-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency], Danon disease [X-linked lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP2) deficiency], and Fabry disease [X-linked lysosomal hydrolase α-galactosidase A (GLA) deficiency]. Pompe and Danon diseases are rare systemic disorders with prominent cardiac hypertrophy and electrophysiologic defects. Encoded on chromosome 17q25.2–q25.3, GAA mutations occur in fewer than 0.2 of 100,000 live births (96) and cause classical infantile Pompe, which is usually fatal within the first year of life, or a less common viable juvenile or adult form, characterized by cardiac hypertrophy and skeletal myopathy (93). The same mutation can occasionally produce different forms of the disease. Cardiac hypertrophy associated with electrophysiologic defects can also indicate LAMP2 mutations. Initially recognized in the context of X-linked Danon disease, LAMP2 mutations cause hypertrophy and skeletal myopathy, with neurologic and hepatic findings. Affected males often die during the second decade of life but females survive decades longer (36). Recent human molecular genetic data indicate that some LAMP2 mutations predominantly cause cardiac disease with mild or subclinical systemic manifestations (3). The mechanisms by which these lysosomal proteins cause hypertrophy and electrophysiologic dysfunction remain incompletely understood. Although glycogen accumulation probably contributes in part to the observed cardiac pathology, more global changes in myocardial metabolism are also likely. These human mutations point to critical roles of lysosomes in the working myocyte and specialized electrical cells of the heart.

Mutations in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) also cause a glycogen storage cardiomyopathy. AMPK is a heterotrimeric protein composed of α, β,
and $\gamma$ subunits, each of which has several isoforms. The enzyme functions as a metabolite-sensing protein kinase that is activated under conditions of energy depletion manifested by increased cellular AMP levels. The kinase regulates energy metabolism by various mechanisms, including activation of glucose transport, stimulation of $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids, inactivation of cholesterol synthesis, inhibition of creatine kinase, and transcriptional regulation of several genes (68). Mutations in exon 5 of $PRKAG2$, encoding the $\gamma 2$ subunit of AMPK produce a distinct cardiomyopathy characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular preexcitation, and progressive conduction system disease (2, 14, 49). $PRKAG2$ cardiomyopathy is not characterized by myofibrillar disarray or cardiac fibrosis. Rather, the hypertrophied myocytes contain vacuoles filled with glycogen and glycogen-protein complexes (amylopectin) (4). Because the $\gamma 2$ subunit has cardiac-specific expression, extracardiac manifestations do not occur in $PRKAG2$ cardiomyopathy, distinguishing this from other forms of glycogen storage cardiomyopathies.

In vitro studies suggest that $\gamma$ subunit mutations cause a gain of function of AMPK. Introducing the Thr400Asn and Asn488Ile mutations into the yeast homologue of the $\gamma 2$ subunit, Snf4, resulted in constitutive activation of the Snf1/Snf4 kinase (2). Expression of recombinant AMPK COS7 cells and pulmonary fibroblasts with the Arg70Gln introduced into the $\gamma 1$ subunit demonstrated markedly increased AMPK activity, associated with increased phosphorylation of the $\alpha$ subunit Thr172 and increased phosphorylation of one of its major substrates, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (54).

Animal models of AMPK mutations also have provided insight into the pathogenesis (12, 66, 136). An Arg200Gln mutation in the Hampshire pig $Prkag3$ gene, encoding the skeletal muscle $\gamma 3$ subunit, produces high glycogen content in skeletal muscle (100). Transgenic mice expressing the Asn488Ile mutation (4) have elevated AMPK activity, a 30-fold increase in glycogen deposition in cardiac myocytes (Figure 2J), dramatic left ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular preexcitation, and sinus node dysfunction. Disruption of the annulus fibrosus by glycogen-filled myocytes was the anatomic substrate for preexcitation, which is frequently present in glycogen storage cardiomyopathies. Markedly elevated AMPK $\alpha 2$, but not $\alpha 1$, activity is present in one-week-old transgenic Asn488Ile mice (4).

Features of $PRKAG2$ cardiomyopathy found in the Asn488Ile transgenic mouse are reversed by expression of a dominant negative transgenic mutation in the $\alpha 2$ subunit of AMPK ($PRKAA2$), which almost abolishes AMPK activity (183). The histological abnormalities, cardiac hypertrophy, glycogen content, and ventricular preexcitation are reduced or normalized in the double transgenic mice (F. Ahmad, M. Arad, N. Musi, H. He, C. Wolf, D. Branco, A. Perez-Atayde, Y. Xing, R. Tian, L. Goodyear, C. Berul, J. Ingwall, C. Seidman, J. Seidman, unpublished observations). Collectively, these data indicate that several $PRKAG2$ mutations produce a gain of function in the catalytic $\alpha 2$ subunit.

With aging, Asn488Ile transgenic mice develop ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction—disease progression that is also found in human patients (4, 49). The processes leading to this end-stage phenotype remain largely unknown.
Defining the cellular events involved in this process should provide information about both acquired and inherited hypertrophic heart disorders that present initially with cardiac hypertrophy and ultimately evolve into a decompensated phenotype.

The demonstration that human PRKAG2 mutations cause constitutive activity of AMPK implicates its downstream targets as possibly being involved in the pathogenesis of the hypertrophic cardiac remodeling. Glucose may be inappropriately taken up by cardiomyocytes and converted to glycogen because transporters are targets of AMPK. The excess glycogen deposition leads to cardiac hypertrophy, ventricular preexcitation, and impaired exercise capacity. Of note, transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative α2 subunit demonstrate blunted cellular glucose uptake in the setting of myocardial ischemia (183). It is possible that the attenuation of the phenotype of the Asn488Ile mutation in double transgenic mice is secondary to a similar reduction in excessive glucose uptake.

Other targets of AMPK activity may also contribute to hypertrophic remodeling. Only a fraction of the proteins that undergo phosphorylation by AMPK are known, and for most of these, their roles in the heart are unexplored. For example, AMPK can phosphorylate TSC2, a kinase encoded by a tuberous sclerosis disease gene (81). Rhabdomyomas, which arise frequently in patients with tuberous sclerosis, are vacuolated muscle tumors that contain abundant amounts of glycogen (62). TSC2 phosphorylates mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a molecule that participates in the degradation of IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate). Thus, AMPK appears to participate in the regulation of muscle cell growth, and may function in a similar fashion in cardiac myocytes.

# DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by left or bi-ventricular dilation in association with depressed myocardial contractility (Figure 2C). Although pathologic study reveals distended chambers of the heart, the histopathology of DCM is often unremarkable with only nonspecific evidence of myocyte hypertrophy, myocyte degeneration, and increased interstitial fibrosis (Figure 2F,I).

DCM is a prevalent cardiomyopathy affecting 36.5 out of 100,000 individuals and is associated with a poor clinical prognosis. Affected individuals exhibit progressive symptoms of easy fatigability, exertional dyspnea, or palpitations, and gradually develop heart failure, often in association with life-threatening atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. The mortality of individuals with symptomatic DCM is high, approaching 25% at one year and 50% at five years (19).

In half of all individuals with DCM there is no recognized antecedent cardiovascular disorder (31). Furthermore, 35% of DCM patients have affected first-degree relatives (51), indicating a considerable role for genetics in disease pathogenesis. Longitudinal family studies also demonstrate several distinct clinical phenotypes of DCM. Some DCM occurs after years of cardiac conduction system disease:

progressive delays in atrioventricular conduction may be evident decades before ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction. Other genetic forms of DCM occur with extracardiac manifestations, most often skeletal muscle disease, but also with hematologic, skin, or hearing disorders. Deciphering how particular mutations causing DCM disrupt the function of other organs will provide new information regarding shared properties among various highly specialized cells.

Inherited DCM is most commonly transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, but autosomal recessive, X-linked, or matrilineal (mitochondrial) inheritances also occur. Initial progress in deciphering the genetic causes of DCM was slow due to the considerable morbidity and mortality of the disease, which limited the availability of large families suitable for genetic linkage studies, the late onset of this disease, and the incomplete penetrance of expression of disease. With the availability of high-density polymorphic genomic markers and the increasingly successful strategy of selecting candidate genes based on biological function, the number of human DCM gene mutations identified (Table 2) has dramatically increased.

Two models may account for cardiac remodeling that results in DCM. The final common pathway model suggests that DCM reflects a nonspecific degenerative state, which occurs by any of a variety of different stimuli: a gene mutation, viral infection, or volume overload. An alternative model is that several independent pathways can remodel the heart and cause DCM. A corollary to this second model is the prediction that despite shared histopathology, the cell biology of different causes of DCM will be distinct. Deciphering genetic causes of DCM has helped to inform these models. Based on a still-incomplete repertoire of known human DCM genes, it is apparent that mutations affect proteins with a wide range of unrelated functions. Models that recapitulate human gene mutations have begun to decipher their biologic consequences, revealing distinct DCM pathways. Whether the myriad of DCM mutations will ultimately converge on a few or many DCM pathways remains under active investigation.

Disruption of myocyte cytoarchitecture, the protein scaffold that connects the nucleus to the extracellular matrix through the sarcolemma, is one pathway leading to DCM. Human mutations (Table 2) have been identified in multiple components of the myocyte cytoskeleton, including cardiac muscle LIM protein (CLP), cypher/ZASP (LBD3), δ-sarcoglycan (SGCD), desmoplakin (DSP) desmin (DES), dystrophin (DMD), telethonin (TCAP), and vinculin (VCL). Mutations in many proteins of the dystrophin-associated complex that cause skeletal muscular dystrophies frequently also cause DCM. However, some mutations produce primarily cardiac disease with little or no skeletal muscle dysfunction. The *DMD* mutation Thr279Ala in humans (124) and a deletion in the δ sarcoglycan gene (*Sgcd*) in the hamster lead to DCM. The Thr279Ala mutation results in a change in polarity in the first hinge region (H1) of the protein and substitution of a beta-sheet for alpha-helix in this portion of the protein, thus destabilizing it. One of the major functional consequences predicted to arise from these cytoskeletal mutations is impaired transmission of contractile force generated by the sarcomere to the extracellular matrix.

Animal models of other human cytoskeletal protein mutations indicate additional potential disease mechanisms. Mice deficient in α-sarcoglycan exhibit altered integrity of the cytoskeleton of coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cells as well as cardiac myocytes. Notably, these mice develop coronary artery vasospasm and myocardial ischemia, indicating that vascular insufficiency may compound deficits in force transmission in this form of DCM (26).

A human mutation in the cytoarchitecture protein desmin may cause DCM through complex mechanisms involving the formation of electron-dense bodies, known as aggresomes, containing amyloid proteins. In transgenic mice designed to model desmin-related DCM, prevalent cytoplasmic aggresomal bodies were found in the heart, which contained amyloid oligomers (150). Accumulation of aggresomes hint that pathways involved in amyloidosis, protein misfolding disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases also contribute to DCM.

The pathophysiologic mechanism of human DCM mutations that affect the nuclear envelope protein lamin A/C (LMNA) remains enigmatic, although recent data implicate deficits in the myocyte cytoskeleton. Ubiquitously expressed in all cells, lamin A/C participates in nuclear dissociation and reassembly during mitosis, but the relevance of this function to terminally differentiated cardiac myocytes, and to mutations that cause DCM, is unclear. Recent analyses of cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts isolated from *Lmna*−/− deficient mice demonstrate deformities of the nucleus and the desmin cytoskeletal network, impaired mechanotransduction, diminished viability during periods of mechanical strain, and impaired activation of transcriptional programs in response to mechanical strain (75, 115). Deformities of the nuclear envelope have also been observed in the skin fibroblasts of patients with LMNA mutations (108). As such, LMNA mutations may limit the adaptive mechanisms of myocyte. Several features of human lamin A/C mutations remain unexplained. Why do defects in the protein cause progressive electrophysiologic abnormalities decades before signs or symptoms of DCM? The considerable phenotypic diversity associated with lamin A/C mutations remains poorly understood. Some mutations lead to DCM and conduction disease in the absence of skeletal myopathy (40); other mutations, particularly those affecting the central helical rod domain, cause juvenile-onset skeletal muscular dystrophies (17, 107); still others affecting carboxyl terminal residues cause familial partial lipodystrophy with insulin-resistant diabetes (160).

Discovering that genetic defects in the myocyte cytoskeleton can cause DCM provided a clue as to the mechanism responsible for acquired DCM, specifically that following viral infection of the heart (myocarditis) (5, 184). Enteroviruses produce protease 2A, which can specifically cleave the hinge 3 region of dystrophin. Mice infected with Coxsackie-B3 have decreased levels of dystrophin-associated sarcoglycans within the sarcolemma, and dystrophin-deficient mice develop more severe DCM when infected with enterovirus. One patient with DCM caused by Coxsackie-B2 myocarditis showed reduced dystrophin and beta-sarcoglycan staining of the sarcolemma of cardiac tissue. Collectively, these data suggest that

enteroviral infections, like some DCM gene mutations, may cause disease by affecting the integrity of the dystrophin-sarcoglycan complex.

Human sarcomere protein gene mutations cause DCM as well as HCM (155). Titin (*TTN*) mutations and some mutations in cardiac actin (*ACTC*), tropomyosin (*TPM1*), and myosin heavy chain (*MYH7*) are located in functional domains involved in force propagation, suggesting that these defects may share a pathophysiologic mechanism with mutations in the myocyte cytoskeleton. However, other sarcomere gene mutations (*TNNT2*) may directly diminish the capacity of the sarcomere to produce force, thereby triggering DCM. A mutation in myosin heavy chain mutation that alters a residue essential for tight actin interactions likely functions in a similar manner. In addition, DCM mutations in troponin T (*TNNT2*) appear to affect sarcomere response to calcium. Cardiac muscle fibers and isolated myocytes into which DCM cardiac troponin T (cTnT) mutation Lys210Δ was introduced showed calcium desensitization and decreased maximal force compared to wild type (85, 106, 148, 178).

Calcium is implicated in the pathology of another DCM due to mutations in phospholamban (*PLN*), the reversible inhibitor of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA2) that regulates basal cardiac contractility (52, 152). Phosphorylation of phospholamban following β-adrenergic stimulation of the heart releases inhibition of SERCA2. One DCM mutation in *PLN* prevents phosphorylation by trapping protein kinase A (PKA). Consequently, calcium reuptake from the cytosol into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is delayed and DCM ensues. Mice engineered to carry the human *PLN* mutations develop fulminant DCM and heart failure, whereas mice deficient in phospholamban have minor cardiac abnormalities (reviewed in 86). When *PLN* is ablated by mutation from mice with DCM that lack the actin-associated cytoskeletal muscle LIM protein, cardiac function improves (103). These data indicate that precisely regulating calcium is central to normal cardiac function; when calcium functions or cycling is directly (via troponin or phospholamban mutation, respectively) or indirectly (via myosin mutation) disturbed cellular events ensue that lead to HCM or DCM.

Altered energetic and metabolic processes of the myocyte can cause DCM. Cardiomyopathy is a well recognized feature of mitochondrial syndromes (20). Recently, DCM mutations were identified in the regulatory SUR2A subunit (encoded by *ABCC9*) of KATP channels (11), a multimeric protein complex that contains a potassium pore and enzyme system that participates in decoding metabolic signals during stress adaptation of cells (189). The causative mutations render KATP channels insensitive to ADP-induced conformation changes; these defects affect channel opening and closure and are predicted to make hearts more susceptible to calcium overload (59).

Additional mechanisms for DCM will likely be discovered. Mutations in tafazzin (*TAZ*), a molecule with unknown biologic functions, have been identified as the cause of X-linked childhood-onset DCM associated with short stature and immunologic deficiency (6). A mutation in *EYA4*, encoding a transcriptional coactivator
that may function as a nuclear phosphatase, causes DCM with sensorineural hearing loss (153). In addition, many more DCM loci have been mapped for which the disease gene remains unknown.

Whether there are interactions among the multiple pathways triggered by human gene mutations that cause DCM is unclear. Study of the transcriptional responses to different DCM gene mutations is one methodology that may address this question. To date, only a few studies (82, 186) have been performed, which have identified altered levels of several functional groups (cytoskeletal and myofibrillar genes, proteins with degradation or synthesis functions, metabolic and stress-response proteins). Whether these altered expression profiles are specific to the inciting molecular defects remains to be determined. To date, these studies have failed to identify signaling molecules that contribute to the observed changes in levels of structural protein. More knowledge of cellular and molecular events triggered by DCM mutations is needed to elucidate the pathways by which the human heart remodels and ultimately fails.

Clinical evaluations of families with DCM gene mutations often reveal the absence of disease in individuals carrying disease-causing mutations. As with HCM, modifier genes likely significantly affect the phenotypic severity of DCM. Loci for several modifier genes have been mapped in a murine model of DCM secondary to cardiac-specific expression of calsequestrin (77).

## RESTRICTIVE CARDIOMYOPATHY

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a rare form of cardiac remodeling characterized by decreased myocardial compliance and elevated diastolic filling pressures. Diastolic dysfunction is prominent and leads to atrial enlargement, elevated systemic and pulmonary venous pressures, and heart failure. Systolic function and myocardial wall thickness remain normal. The prevalence and the incidence of RCM have not been assessed accurately, but estimates indicate that restrictive remodeling occurs in less than 5% of all cardiomyopathies (42).

The extremely low prevalence of RCM combined with the need for catheterization-based diagnostic procedures has limited the identification of kindreds appropriate for linkage and mutation analysis. Hence, advances in the molecular genetics of RCM have been limited to candidate gene studies. Zhang and colleagues identified a four-generation family with RCM pathophysiology due to desmin deposition in cardiac myocytes (188). Sequence analyses of desmin and of other candidate genes failed to define the responsible mutation. Mogensen and colleagues identified a single family in which some members exhibited RCM whereas others had classic findings of HCM (105). A cardiac troponin I (TNNTI3) mutation was found in all family members with either form of cardiomyopathy, RCM or HCM. Analyses of TNNTI3 sequences in other unrelated RCM patients led to the identification of additional mutations by these investigators. All RCM mutations in TNNTI3 were located in domains involved in actomyosin ATPase inhibitory function.
These data suggest that although HCM, DCM, and RCM are often considered distinct clinical entities, they may be genetically and pathologically related. Progressive accumulation of cardiac fibrosis triggered by gene mutations that cause either HCM or DCM can affect hemodynamic parameters (in particular impaired diastolic relaxation) so as to superimpose restrictive physiology onto remodeling programs. This mechanism may account for why an identical mutation causes either HCM or RCM in the same family. Additional genetic and environmental factors, in addition to the primary mutation, may modify the disease phenotype.

# ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR DYSPLASIA/CARDIOMYOPATHY

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD or ARVC) is an intriguing inherited disorder characterized by replacement of the right ventricular myocardium by adipose and fibrous tissue and is associated with sudden cardiac death. Research to elucidate ARVD disease manifestations, pathogenesis, and genetics has been impeded by several factors, including technical difficulties in imaging the right ventricle and, until recently, limited clinical awareness of this disorder. Rampazzo and colleagues estimate the prevalence of ARVD in the Veneto region of Italy to be 6/10,000 and, in certain subpopulations, 44/10,000 (137). In Italy, 12.5% to 25% of sudden death events in both sedentary individuals and young athletes under the age of 35 years were caused by undiagnosed ARVD (7, 43). These findings have been corroborated elsewhere in the world. In the United States, 17% of sudden death victims between the ages of 20 and 40 years had ARVD (161). In addition, ARVD was found in 18 of 50 cases of sudden unexpected perioperative death (169), affecting a wide variety of ethnic groups. Associated with clinically important ventricular arrhythmias, ARVD has a high annual mortality rate of 3%, which may be reduced to 1% by medical therapy (130).

The histopathology of ARVD is characterized by progressive replacement of the right ventricular myocardium by adipose and fibrous tissue (Figure 2K) (28). Affected myocardial tissue demonstrates sparse myocytes interspersed among adipocytes and fibrous tissue, a process that appears to begin at the epicardium and gradually extends through the myocardium toward the subendocardium. The anterior right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), the apex, and the inferoposterior wall are most frequently affected, but eventually the entire right ventricle becomes diffusely involved (109, 112). Adipocytes and fibrous tissue are found in the left ventricle in 76% of patients (28). The interventricular septum is affected in only 20% of patients (8), which contributes to the underdiagnosis of ARVD because the septum is the routine site for endomyocardial biopsies.

Descriptive studies suggest that loss of myocardium and replacement by adipose and fibrous tissue in ARVD result from excessive and inappropriate apoptosis of cardiac myocytes. Investigators have observed apoptosis in myocardial samples from patients with ARVD (185).

In almost all families, ARVD is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern. Nine genetic loci associated with this disease have been ascertained by genetic linkage analysis or candidate gene analysis, and mutations in genes at three loci have now been discovered (Table 3). ARVD mutations have been identified in genes that encode protein components of cardiac desmosomes: plakophilin-2 (PKP2) (47), desmoplakin (DSP) (139), and junctional plakoglobin (JUP) (95). Plakophilin-2, an armadillo-repeat protein encoded on chromosome 12p11, is abundantly expressed in cardiac muscle. Located on the outer domain of desmosomes, it links cadherins with desmoplakin and the intermediate filaments within myocytes.

deficient in *Pkp2* die during mid-gestation with morphologic defects and abnormal architecture of myocyte junctions. Plakoglobin is a cytoplasmic protein, which is a submembranous constituent of both kinds of cell-cell adhering junctions, the desmosomal and the adherens junctions. Plakoglobin participates in bridging the intermediate filament and the intracellular actin cytoskeletal networks to the trans-membrane complexes connecting adjacent cells (50). Desmoplakin is a constituent of the desmosomal plaque, anchoring intermediate filaments to the plasma membrane and forming a scaffold that is essential for maintaining tissue integrity. In myocardial and Purkinje fiber cells, it also binds to desmin (79). These proteins, therefore, serve a structural function similar to other proteins implicated in DCM.

A variety of *PKP2* mutations have been identified, including missense, small insertions and deletions, and splice site defects. Whether these defects result in functionally null alleles or cause ARVD by a dominant negative mechanism is unknown. One *DSP* mutation, Ser299Arg (139), disrupts a protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site that is involved in plakoglobin binding and in clustering desmosomal cadherin-plakoglobin complexes.

Naxos disease is clinically related to ARVD but with notable differences, including an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, diffuse nonepidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma, and woolly hair (25), in addition to the cardiac manifestations. A frameshift mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin (*JUP*) that alters five amino acids and then prematurely terminates translation was the first mutation identified to cause Naxos disease. Emphasizing even further the parallels between ARVD and DCM, a single base pair deletion (7991delG) in *DSP* was found in a family with autosomal recessive DCM associated with keratoderma and woolly hair (116). Thus, in some patients with ARVD, a degenerative mechanism similar to that observed in DCM appears to be involved. Altered integrity at cardiac myocyte cell-cell junctions may promote myocyte degeneration and death, with the repair process consisting of adipose and fibrous tissue replacing myocardium. In addition, plakoglobin plays a direct role in regulating apoptotic cell death (53).

The basis for the striking predilection of pathology in the right ventricle with ARVD remains unclear despite the identification of causative mutations. Plakophilin, plakoglobin, and desmoplakin are expressed in both ventricles and, as noted above, a mutation in *DSP* that results in left ventricular DCM was reported (116). The striking asymmetric ventricular involvement in ARVD may be due to the relative thinness of the right ventricular free wall, which makes it more susceptible to mechanical stress.

Another breakthrough in understanding the molecular genetics of ARVD occurred with the identification of mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (*RYR2*) leading to ARVD (173). *RYR2*, which contains 105 exons, encodes a 565-kDa product containing 4967 amino acids. This polypeptide monomer is part of a homotetrameric membrane-spanning calcium channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum and interacts with four regulatory 12-kDa FK-506 binding proteins (FKBP12.6). This channel serves critical functions in excitation-contraction (EC) coupling and intracellular calcium homeostasis within the cardiac myocyte.

Stimulating voltage-sensitive L-type calcium channels (dihydropyridine receptors) on the outer myocardial cell membrane allows the entry of small amounts of calcium ions, which in turn activate release of larger amounts of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen into the cytoplasm via RyR2.

The carboxyl end of the RyR2 channel is anchored to the sarcoplasmic reticulum by 4 to 10 membrane-spanning hydrophobic motifs and a large cytoplasmic domain that is proximate to the outer cell membrane L-type calcium channels (27). Critical elements of the channel include the pore and sites for ATP binding, calmodulin binding, and FKBP12.6 binding. Sites for binding of two other major protein phosphatases in cardiac muscle, protein phosphatase 1, and protein phosphatase 2A are also present (92).

Several RYR2 channel mutations that cause ARVD have been identified (9, 173). Three missense mutations appear to cluster at the amino end of the protein, and three appear to cluster in the center of the protein at its FKBP12.6 binding domain. As indicated in Table 3, families with ARVD secondary to mutations in RYR2 are distinguished by an unusual propensity to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) (9). Mutations in the FKBP12.6 binding domain, or at the carboxyl end of the transmembrane domain RYR2 gene have also been identified in families with isolated CPVT transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern (74, 135). These families had no evidence of structural heart disease (165). Thus, two disorders, ARVD and CPVT, can result from mutations in the same gene, as observed with other disorders such as HCM, DCM, and RCM. An intriguing question is why different mutations in the RYR2 gene lead to two distinct phenotypes. Mutations in the amino terminal cluster have been reported only in families demonstrating ARVD and, conversely, mutations in the carboxyl cluster have been reported only in families with CPVT. Although the function of the RyR2 polypeptide domain at the amino cluster is unclear, it is located in the cytoplasm whereas the carboxyl cluster contains the transmembrane domains. Mutations in the central cluster lead to both phenotypes. Perhaps each group of amino acids, when mutated, alters the function or structure of the polypeptide in a distinct manner so that both groups of mutations produce the CPVT, but only one group is associated with the structural changes characteristic of ARVD. An alternative hypothesis is that mutations in the same gene produce different phenotypes because of differing genetic backgrounds in each family. Different alleles of modifier genes in each family may attenuate or promote the development of ARVD in addition to CPVT. A third possibility is that families with ARVD and with CPVT are exposed to different environmental influences, which lead to different phenotypes. The mechanisms leading to distinct phenotypes should be elucidated as further mutations are identified.

The mechanism whereby the mutations identified in the RYR2 gene lead to ARVD remains enigmatic. One of the identified mutations, Arg176Gln, corresponds to a mutation in the skeletal muscle isoform of the ryanodine receptor, Arg163Gln, for which functional studies are available (61). This mutation results in hyperactivation and hypersensitivity of the channel, leading to excessive calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The mutations in the vicinity
of an FKBP12.6 binding domain may attenuate the negative regulatory effect of FKBP12.6 (133) and thus similarly lead to hyperactivation and hypersensitivity of the RyR2 channel. Cytoplasmic calcium overload resulting from these mutations can cause delayed afterdepolarizations, which in turn produce ventricular tachycardia (134). Delayed afterdepolarizations are enhanced by adrenergic stimulation. Thus, elevating ambient catecholamine levels during exertion or stress, in the setting of a hyperactivated or hypersensitive mutant RYR2 allele, may lead to the arrhythmias that are clinically apparent. The mechanism of the histological changes is less obvious. Ryanodine receptor (RyR1 and RyR2) activation by caffeine stimulates apoptosis in prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells, whereas inhibition by ryanodine inhibits apoptosis (88). Thus, there may be a relationship between RyR2 and apoptosis.

# CONCLUSIONS

Remarkable strides have been made in elucidating the molecular genetics of cardiomyopathies, considering that they were deemed “idiopathic” less than two decades ago. A large proportion of HCM is secondary to mutations in sarcomeric proteins. PRKAG2 cardiomyopathy was unknown as a distinct entity and had been grouped with HCM on the basis of noninvasive clinical testing. Identifying causative mutations and modeling these mutations in yeast and mice have elucidated the pathogenesis of diseases that are completely divergent from HCM.

DCM occurs as a result of mutations in genes encoding a variety of proteins, including sarcomeric and structural proteins, and may result from activation of several different independent mechanisms. Although progress has been slower in the study of RCM and ARVD, causative mutations are being identified with increasing speed. These disorders indicate ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction may be the end result of various insults, initiated by mutations with many different effects on myocytes.

Identifying the causative mutation in patients with cardiomyopathies by genetic diagnosis facilitates early recognition of individuals at risk for arrhythmias and sudden death. In addition to the important clinical information this provides to patients, families, and physicians, longitudinal investigation of individuals with gene mutations provides an opportunity further to expand data on myocyte and myocardial response to gene mutations. Better information of the cell and molecular signals triggered by gene mutations should continue to provide new knowledge about myocyte biology as well as foster development of rationale therapy for cardiomyopathies that may ultimately reduce progression to heart failure.

GENETICS OF CARDIAC REMODELING C-1

![Diagram of cardiac myocyte structure](image.png)

Figure 1 The structure of the cardiac myocyte, showing the sarcomere, the cytoskeletal network, calcium channels, nuclear proteins, lysosomes, mitochondria, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Mutations in the genes encoding most of the protein components of these structures lead to cardiomyopathies. Copyright © 1999 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

Figure 2 Anatomic and histological remodeling in cardiomyopathies. Morphologic features of the normal heart (A), compared to hypertrophic (B) and dilated (C) cardiomyopathy. The normal myocardial histology (D) is distorted by myocyte hypertrophy, disarray, and fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (E), and myocyte loss and fibrosis in diluted cardiomyopathy (DCM) (F). Compared with normal tissue (G), increased interstitial fibrosis (*blue*) is evident by the Masson trichrome stain in both HCM (H) and DCM (I). Cardiac tissue from mice with a human *PRKAG2* mutation demonstrates glycogen cardiomyopathy (J). Note the vacuoles within the myocytes. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (K) demonstrates dramatic increases in adipose (A) and fibrous tissue (F) that replace normal myocytes. (D–F, J, and K represent the hematoxylin and eosin stain.)

Figure 3 A three-dimensional representation of the actin-myosin complex, showing positions of known cardiomyopathy mutations. One myosin heavy chain (white), one essential myosin light chain (orange), one regulatory myosin light chain (purple), and five actin monomers (shades of green) are displayed. Residues in actin and myosin that are mutated in HCM are indicated in blue, and residues mutated in DCM are indicated in red.
