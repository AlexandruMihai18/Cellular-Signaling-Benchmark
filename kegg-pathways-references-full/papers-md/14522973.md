A pathogen-induced oxygenase showing homology to prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases-1 and -2 was recently characterized by *in vitro* experiments as a fatty acid α-dioxygenase catalyzing formation of unstable 2(R)-hydroperoxy fatty acids. To study the activity of this enzyme under *in vivo* conditions and to elucidate the fate of enzymatically produced 2-hydroperoxides, leaves of tobacco were analyzed for the presence of α-dioxygenase-generated compounds as well as for lipoxygenase (LOX) products and free fatty acids. Low basal levels of 2-hydroxylinolenic acid (0.4 nmol/g fresh weight) and 8,11,14-heptadecatrienoic acid (0.1 nmol/g) could be demonstrated. These levels increased strongly upon infection with the bacterium *Pseudomonas syringae pv syringae* (548 and 47 nmol/g, respectively). Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing α-dioxygenase were developed, and incompatible infection of such plants led to a dramatic elevation of 2-hydroxylinolenic acid (1778 nmol/g) and 8,11,14-heptadecatrienoic acid (86 nmol/g), whereas the levels of LOX products were strongly decreased. Further analysis of oxylipins in infected leaves revealed the presence of a number of 2-hydroxy fatty acids differing with respect to chain length and degree of unsaturation as well as two new doubly oxygenated oxylipins identified as 2(R),9(S)-dihydroxy-10(E),12(Z),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid and 2(R),9(S)-dihydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid. α-Dioxygenase-generated 2-hydroxylinolenic acid, and to a lesser extent lipoxygenase-generated 9-hydroxyoctadecatrienoic acid, exerted a tissue-protective effect in bacterially infected tobacco leaves.

which can be further transformed into leukotrienes and other biologically active compounds. In plants, linoleic and linolenic acids are the most important substrates for LOX catalysis, and secondary modification of hydroperoxides is mainly effected by the enzymes allene oxide synthase, hydroperoxide lyase, and divinyl ether synthase (1). The oxygenated derivatives thus formed include the phytohormone jasmonic acid as well as reactive oxylipins possessing epoxide, conjugated carbonyl, or aldehyde functionalities (2). It is well recognized that LOX-derived oxylipins are involved in physiological processes in plants such as growth and fertility (3). Furthermore, several lines of evidence indicate that oxylipins have important roles to fulfill in the defense reactions that take place as a consequence of infection of plants with bacteria, insects, fungi, and other pathogens (4). Thus, aldehydes generated through the LOX-hydroperoxide lyase pathway can exert toxic effects against bacteria and fungi, and colnelenic acid and other divinyl ether fatty acids formed by the 9-LOX-divinyl ether synthase pathway inhibit mycelial growth of the potato pathogen *Phytophthora infestans* (5). Other oxylipins, notably those belonging to the jasmonate family of compounds, can act as signaling molecules leading to activation of specific defensive genes in the host plant. In agreement with the proposed role of oxylipins in plant defense, several studies have demonstrated that phytopathogens can activate phospholipases in plant leaves (6) resulting in liberation of free fatty acids, a prerequisite for the formation of oxylipins by LOX catalysis.

It was recently discovered that there exists in plant leaves, besides the lipoxygenases, another group of dioxygenases attacking fatty acids, i.e. α-dioxygenases. α-DOX1, the major α-dioxygenase in tobacco, possessed heme-binding motifs and showed homology to mammalian prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases but was structurally unrelated to lipoxygenases (7–9). In addition to tobacco, several other plants, including *Arabidopsis* (7–9), cucumber (8, 10), pea (11), rice (12), and the green alga *Ulva pertusa* (13), have been reported to possess α-DOXes, a few of which have been partially purified. *In vitro* studies using recombinant α-DOX1 from tobacco demonstrated that this enzyme catalyzes the stereospecific introduction of oxygen at the C-2 (α-) position of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids to form unstable 2-hydroperoxide derivatives (8).

The role of $\alpha$-dioxygenase in higher plants is not well established, although its participation in the plant $\alpha$-oxidation pathway has been suggested (8, 11). Bacterial infection of tobacco leaves leads to accumulation of the $\alpha$-DOX1 protein (7), and the levels are higher and appear earlier when the infection results in a hypersensitive reaction (HR) (7, 14). This finding and results obtained with $\alpha$-DOX1 transgenic *Arabidopsis* plants suggested that one or more products formed by the $\alpha$-DOX pathway protect plant tissues from undergoing excessive necrosis during the HR response (14). Further studies in this area were hampered by the lack of information regarding $\alpha$-DOX activity in intact plant tissues and the metabolic fate of the putative 2-hydroperoxides. The present study provides qualitative and quantitative information about the oxylipins biosynthesized by $\alpha$-DOX in tobacco leaves under basal conditions and during infection with compatible or incompatible strains of *Pseudomonas*. The incompatible infection caused a massive production of 2(*R*)-hydroxy fatty acids, and these compounds emerge as the prime candidates for $\alpha$-DOX-generated signaling molecules. Additionally, experimental evidence for the anti-necrotic activity of two of the oxylipins accumulating in leaves is provided.

### EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

#### Plants
Tobacco plants used in this study were wild type or transgenic *Nicotiana tabacum* cv Petit Havana SR1 grown on soil under a 14-h-light and 10-h-dark photoperiod. Plants were treated and examined 8 weeks after seed germination.

#### Oxylipins
2(*R*)-Hydroxylinolenic (2(*R*)-HOT) was isolated from seeds of *Thymus vulgaris* as previously described (8). These seeds also contained low levels of 2(*R*)-hydroxylinoelic acid as well as 8(*Z*),11(*Z*),14(*Z*)-heptadecatrienoic acid. 2-Hydroxy derivatives of oleic, stearic, and palmitic acids were prepared by chemical oxygenation (8). All other oxylipins were purchased from Larodan Fine Chemicals, Malmö, Sweden.

#### 2,9-Dihydroxystearic Acid
Methyl 2(*R*,*S*)-hydroxyoleate (5 mg) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (0.5 ml), and water (0.5 ml) containing 10 mg of mercuric acetate was added. The mixture was stirred at 23 °C for 60 h and then cooled to 0 °C and treated with sodium borohydride (5 mg) in water (0.3 ml). Material extracted with diethyl ether was subjected to preparative TLC using a solvent system of ethyl acetate–hexane (3:7, v/v). Two main bands appeared due to methyl-2,9-dihydroxystearate ($R_{F} = 0.25$) and methyl 2,10-dihydroxystearate ($R_{F} = 0.29$). The mass spectrum of the Me₃Si derivative of the isolated methyl-2,9-dihydroxystearate showed prominent ions at $m/z$ 459 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-15$; loss of CH₃), 415 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-59$; loss of COOCH₃), 369 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-(15+90)$; loss of CH₃ plus Me₃SiOH), 347 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-127$; loss of $(\mathrm{CH}_{2})_{8}\mathrm{CH}_{3}$), and 229 ($\mathrm{Me}_{3}\mathrm{SiO}^{+}=\mathrm{CH}-(\mathrm{CH}_{2})_{8}\mathrm{CH}_{3}$).

#### Deuterium-labeled Linolenic Acid
[9,10,12,13,15,16-$^{2}$H$_{6}$]Linolenic acid was prepared by catalytic deuteration of 7,10,13-hexadecatriynol (a generous gift from Prof. Howard Sprecher, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH) followed by two-carbon elongation by malonic ester synthesis. The specimen of deuterated linolenic acid thus obtained consisted of 99.9% deuterated and 0.1% undeuterated molecules.

#### Deuterium-labeled 9-HOT
[9,10,12,13,15,16-$^{2}$H$_{6}$]9-HPOT (99.2% deuterated and 0.8% undeuterated molecules) was obtained by incubation of [$^{2}$H$_{6}$]linolenic acid (70 mg) with recombinant 9-LOX followed by purification by straight-phase-HPLC. An aliquot of the hydroperoxide was reduced by treatment with sodium borohydride and purified by straight-phase-HPLC to provide [9,10,12,13,15,16-$^{2}$H$_{6}$]9-HOT (99.2% deuterated and 0.8% undeuterated molecules).

#### Deuterium-labeled 9,12,13-TriHOD
For the preparation of deuterium-labeled 9,12,13-TriHOD advantage was taken of the facts that fatty acid hydroperoxides undergo stereospecific epoxidation in the presence of peroxygenase in seeds of *Vicia faba* (15, 16) and that the epoxy alcohols thus produced are hydrolyzed into triols by epoxide hydrolase in the same seed (16). Accordingly, incubation of [9,10,12,13,15,16-$^{2}$H$_{6}$]9-HPOT (35 mg) with the 9300 × g supernatant of a homogenate of *V. faba* seeds (1:10, w/v; 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 6.7) at 23 °C for 90 min followed by purification by TLC and RP-HPLC afforded [9,10,12,13,15,16-$^{2}$H$_{6}$]9,12,13-TriHOD (98.2% deuterated and 1.8% undeuterated molecules). The specimen was further purified by crystallization from ethyl acetate/hexane (final yield, 10%) and found to be homogenous upon analysis as the methyl ester/Me₃Si derivative by GC-MS. Its identity with 9,12,13-TriHOD, *i.e.* 9(*S*),12(*S*),13(*S*)-trihydroxy-10(*E*),15(*Z*)-octadecadienoic acid, was rigorously established by comparison with samples of the authentic compound prepared either by chemical synthesis or by incubation of linolenic acid with homogenate of potato leaves (17).

#### Deuterium-labeled 2-HOT—Methyl-2-oxolinolenate (58 mg) (8) was dissolved in 39 ml of CH₃O²H containing 0.3 M sodium methoxide. Deuterium oxide (20 ml) was added, and the mixture was kept at 23 °C for 15 h under an atmosphere of argon. Sodium borodeuteride (500 mg) was added, and the solution was kept at 23 °C for 2 h. The deuterated hydroxy acid was isolated by extraction with diethyl ether and purified by reverse phase-HPLC. The [2,3,3-$^{2}$H₃]2-HOT obtained (27 mg) had the following isotope composition: 96.4% trideuterated, 2.6% dideuterated, 0.6% monodeuterated, and 0.4% undeuterated molecules.

#### $\alpha$-DOX-9-LOX Double Oxygenation Products
Tritium-labeled 9-HOT (200 μM) was stirred at 23 °C for 20 min with the 100,000 × g particulate fraction from homogenate of cucumber (8), and the extract was subjected to reverse phase-HPLC. The main peak of radioactive material was due to 8(*S*)-hydroxy-9(*E*),11(*Z*),14(*Z*)-heptadecatrienal, which was identified by its mass spectrum (Me₃Si derivative) showing prominent ions at $m/z$ 336 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}$), 267 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-69$; loss of $\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$), and 223 ($\mathrm{Me}_{3}\mathrm{SiO}^{+}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-(\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2})_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$). Material forming a smaller peak was identified as 2(*R*),9(*S*)-dihydroxy-10(*E*),12(*Z*),15(*Z*)-octadecatrienoic acid on the basis of its UV spectrum ($\lambda_{\text {max }}=234 \mathrm{~nm}$) and mass spectrum (methyl ester/Me₃Si derivative) showing prominent ions at $m/z$ 468 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-69$; loss of $\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$), 363 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-(15+90)$; loss of $\mathrm{CH}_{3}+\mathrm{Me}_{3}\mathrm{SiOH}$), 319 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-(59+90)$; loss of $\mathrm{COOCH}_{3}+\mathrm{Me}_{3}\mathrm{SiOH}$), and 223 ($\mathrm{Me}_{3}\mathrm{SiO}^{+}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-(\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2})_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$). Catalytic hydrogenation yielded 2,9-dihydroxystearic acid, the identity of which was ascertained by mass spectral comparison with the authentic compound. An additional product formed in these incubations was the one-carbon shortened homolog of 9-HOT, *i.e.* 8-hydroxy-9,11,14-octadecatrienoic acid. The methyl ester/Me₃Si derivative of this compound showed prominent ions at $m/z$ 366 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}$), 351 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-15$; loss of $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$), 297 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-69$; loss of $\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$), and 223 ($\mathrm{Me}_{3}\mathrm{SiO}^{+}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-(\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2})_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$).

#### $\alpha$-DOX-13-LOX Double Oxygenation Products
2(*R*)-Hydroxylinolenic acid (2.1 mM) in 0.1 M borate buffer pH 10.0 was stirred with soybean lipoxygenase-1 at 0 °C for 15 min under O₂, which resulted in smooth conversion into a new hydroxy-hydroperoxide derivative (yield, more than 90%). This material was reduced by treatment with sodium borohydride, and the product was identified as 2(*R*),13(*S*)-dihydroxy-9(*Z*),11(*E*),15(*Z*)-octadecatrienoic acid by UV spectrometry ($\lambda_{\text {max }}=234 \mathrm{~nm}$) and mass spectrometry (methyl ester/Me₃Si derivative; prominent ions at $m/z$ 453 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-15$; loss of $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$), 399 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-69$; loss of $\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$), 363 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-(15+90)$; loss of $\mathrm{CH}_{3}+\mathrm{Me}_{3}\mathrm{SiOH}$), 319 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-(59+90)$; loss of $\mathrm{COOCH}_{3}+\mathrm{Me}_{3}\mathrm{SiOH}$), and 267).

In other experiments, 8(*Z*),11(*Z*),14(*Z*)-heptadecatrienal (400 μM) was stirred at 0 °C with soybean lipoxygenase-1 for 15 min. The extracted material was reduced by treatment with sodium borohydride in methanol, converted into Me₃Si derivatives and analyzed by GC-MS. Two main peaks appeared due to 8,11,14-heptadecatrienol (corresponding to unconverted starting material) and 8,10,14-heptadecatrien-1,12-diol (corresponding to heptadecatrienal oxygenated at C-12). Although this experiment showed that 8,11,14-heptadecatrienal served as a substrate for soybean lipoxygenase-1, difficulties were encountered in isolating the hydroperoxyaldehyde or selectively reducing the hydroperoxide function. It was found that the easiest way to obtain the required hydroxyaldehyde was by performing periodate oxidation (sodium periodate in acetone/acetic acid/water, 2:1:0.5, v/v, 6 h at 50 °C) of the abovementioned 2(*R*),13(*S*)-dihydroxy-9(*Z*),11(*E*),15(*Z*)-octadecatrienoic acid. The mass spectrum (Me₃Si derivative) of the 12(*S*)-hydroxy-8(*Z*),10(*E*),14(*Z*)-heptadecatrienal thus obtained showed prominent ions at inter alia $m/z$ 321 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-15$; loss of $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$) and 267 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-69$; loss of $\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$).

#### Construction of Chimeric Constructs and Generation of Transgenic Plants
35S:$\alpha$-DOX1 antisense and sense constructs were prepared by cloning the entire $\alpha$-DOX1 cDNA into the binary vector pGSJ780A behind the CaMV35S promoter. Constructs were introduced in *Agrobacterium tumefaciens* (strain C58C1 RifR) and transferred to tobacco plants by leaf disc transformation (18). Homozygous transgenic lines were selected for these studies.

#### Analysis of Gene Expression and Immunoblots
RNA (19) was analyzed in agarose formaldehyde gels, transferred to Hybond N membranes, and hybridized to single-stranded riboprobes following standard procedures (20). The amount of loaded RNA was verified by addition of ethidium bromide to the samples and photography under UV light

FIG. 1. Analysis of tobacco plants with altered levels of $\alpha$-DOX1 expression. RNA and proteins were extracted from control (SR1), $\alpha$-DOX1 sense (sense 16), or $\alpha$-DOX1 antisense (antisense 5) tobacco plants at times indicated after inoculation with the incompatible bacterium *P. syringae*. A, accumulation of $\alpha$-DOX1 mRNA. Blots were hybridized with riboprobes derived from an $\alpha$-DOX1 cDNA. B, accumulation of $\alpha$-DOX1 protein. Protein gel blots of fractionated extracts probed with the anti-tobacco-$\alpha$-DOX1 antiserum are shown.

after electrophoresis. Protein extracts of plant tissues for immunoblot analyses were prepared by grinding leaves to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. Extraction buffer was then added at a ratio of 2 ml/g fresh tissue. Supernatants were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at $3000 \times g$, and $25 \mu g$ of protein was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. Immunoblot assays were performed as previously described (7) using anti-tobacco-$\alpha$-DOX1 antibodies. Bacterial inoculation was done by injecting leaves in the apoplast with a late-logarithmic culture using a syringe. The bacteria were grown in King’s medium (2% proteose peptone, 2% glycerol, $6.5 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}$, and $6 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MgSO}_{4} \cdot 7 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$) at $27^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. After centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in sterile water to reach a final concentration of $10^{6}$ bacteria per milliliter. An incompatible strain of *Pseudomonas syringae* pv *syringae* (NCPPB2686) and a compatible bacterium *P.* pv *tabaci* (NCPPB1427) were used.

Extraction of Leaf Tissue and Sample Preparation—Operations involving leaves or powdered leaves were carried out on dry ice or using liquid nitrogen. Aliquots of powdered leaves were rapidly ($30-60 \mathrm{~s}$) weighed at sub-zero temperature, and the sample ($100-200 \mathrm{mg}$) was immediately thereafter added to ice-cold ethanol ($10 \mathrm{ml}$) containing ${ }^{[2]} \mathrm{H}_{6}$ linolenic acid ($140.8 \mathrm{nmol}$), ${ }^{[2]} \mathrm{H}_{6} 9$-HOT ($17.4 \mathrm{nmol}$), ${ }^{[2]} \mathrm{H}_{6} 9,12,13$-TriHOD ($14.6 \mathrm{nmol}$), and ${ }^{[2]} \mathrm{H}_{3} 2$-HOT ($18.5 \mathrm{nmol}$). The mixture was homogenized at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 3 min using an Ultra-Turrax operating at $24,000 \mathrm{rpm}$. The supernatant obtained following centrifugation was taken to dryness, and the residual material was redissolved in $3 \mathrm{ml}$ of 2-propanol/chloroform 1:2 (v/v) and loaded onto a 0.5-g aminopropyl cartridge (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). Neutral lipids were eluted with $6 \mathrm{ml}$ of the same solvent mixture, whereas non-polar to medium polar acidic lipids, including fatty acids and 9- and 13-HOT, were eluted with $9 \mathrm{ml}$ of diethyl ether/acetic acid 98:2 (v/v). Elution with $9 \mathrm{ml}$ of methanol/ acetic acid 98:2 (v/v) afforded a fraction containing polar acidic lipids, including 9,12,13-TriHOD, 9,10,11-TriHOD, and 2-HOT. Material present in the two fractions containing acidic lipids were treated with diazomethane and subsequently derivatized with trimethylchlorosilane/hexamethyldisilazane/pyridine prior to GC-MS analysis.

GC-MS Analysis—GC-MS was carried out with a Hewlett-Packard model 5970B mass selective detector connected to a Hewlett-Packard model 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with an SPB-1701 capillary column (length, $15 \mathrm{~m}$; film thickness, $0.25 \mu \mathrm{m}$; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). Helium at a flow rate of $32 \mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{s}$ was used as the carrier gas. Injections were made in the split mode using an initial column temperature of $120^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The temperature was raised at $7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{min}$ until $260^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The scan mode was used for structural analysis of new oxylipins. For quantitative determination of linolenic acid, 9-HOT, 9,12,13-TriHOD, and 2-HOT, the

instruments was operated in the selected ion monitoring mode, and the corresponding deuterated compounds were used as internal standards. Known mixtures of unlabeled and deuterium-labeled compounds were analyzed, and standard curves were constructed by plotting the ratio of intensities of ions due to unlabeled/deuterium-labeled compounds versus the molar compositions of the mixtures analyzed. Straight lines having slopes $0.93-1.22$ and $y$-intercepts $0.001-0.018$ were obtained. For the determination of linoleic acid and 8(Z),11(Z),14(Z)-heptadecatrienoic acid, the internal standard used was ${ }^{[2]} \mathrm{H}_{6}$ linolenic acid. In the same way, 13-HOT was determined using the added ${ }^{[2]} \mathrm{H}_{6} 9$-HOT, and 9,10,11-TriHOD was determined using the ${ }^{[2]} \mathrm{H}_{6} 9,12,13$-TriHOD. Also in the cases where the internal reference compound was non-identical to the analyte, known mixtures of analytes and deuterated compounds were analyzed and standard curves constructed.

Antibacterial Activity Assay—In vitro antibacterial activity of oxylipins was evaluated according to Broekart et al. (21). Bacteria were grown in wells of microplates and growth was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the microcultures after 24 h of incubation. A culture volume of $100 \mu \mathrm{l}$ per well was used. Bacterial species examined were: *P. syringae* pv *syringae* (NCPPB2686), *P. syringae* pv *tabaci* (NCPPB-1427), *P. syringae* pv *tomato* DC3000 (22), *P. syringae* pv *maculicola* (NCPPB 1820), *Xanthomonas campestris* pv. *campestris* 8004, *X. campestris* pv *campestris* 147 (23), *Erwinia carotovora* sp. *carotovora* (NCPB 550), and *E. carotovora* ssp. *carotovora* SCC3193 (24). Bacterial cultures were grown at $28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in the presence of the test products and $\sim 2000$ bacteria per well. *Erwinia* was grown in LPG medium (0.3% yeast extract, 0.5% Bacto-peptone, and 0.5% glucose), *Pseudomonas* in King’s medium (see above), and *Xanthomonas* in Kado medium (1% yeast extract, 0.8% casamino acids, 1% saccharose, $6.5 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}$, and $6 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MgSO}_{4} \cdot 7 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$). Absorbance measurements were carried out at $595 \mathrm{~nm}$ with a Bio-Rad microplate reader. Reported data are the means and standard deviations of the values obtained in at least three independent experiments.

Examination of Cell Viability in Response to Oxylipin Treatment—$50 \mu \mathrm{l}$ of pure oxylipin solutions, at concentrations of 50 or $100 \mu \mathrm{M}$, were injected into the apoplast of tobacco leaves using a syringe. Test products were applied alone or with suspensions ($5 \times 10^{6}$ bacteria per ml) of the incompatible strain *P. syringae* pv *syringae* (NCPPB2686) or the compatible bacterium *P. syringae* pv *tabaci* (NCPPB1427). Visible symptoms were observed daily, and cell death of infiltrated areas was examined by lactophenol-trypan blue staining ($10 \mathrm{ml}$ of lactic acid, $10 \mathrm{ml}$ of glycerol, $10 \mathrm{~g}$ of phenol, $20 \mathrm{mg}$ of trypan blue, dissolved in $10 \mathrm{ml}$ of distilled water) at 2 and 4 days after inoculation. Leaf discs from infiltrated areas were boiled for $\sim 1 \mathrm{~min}$ in the stain solution and then decolorized with chloral hydrate ($2.5 \mathrm{~g}$ of chloral hydrate dissolved in $1 \mathrm{ml}$ of distilled water) for at least $30 \mathrm{~min}$. They were mounted in chloral hydrate and viewed under a light microscope. At least three independent plants were used for each treatment, and a minimum of 10 infiltrated areas were examined per plant.

RESULTS

Generation of Transgenic Tobacco Plants with Altered Levels of $\alpha$-DOX1 Expression—Transgenic plants containing the entire $\alpha$-DOX1 cDNA fused to the CaMV35S promoter, in both sense and antisense orientation, were generated and used to study the activity of $\alpha$-dioxygenase in vivo. Selection of appropriate transgenics was based on the level of $\alpha$-DOX1 expression found in independent lines responding to inoculation with the incompatible bacterium *P.* pv *syringae*. Results from these analyses are shown in Fig. 1. In wild type plants, untreated leaves gave a weak hybridization signal that increased in RNA

samples extracted 8 h after bacterial inoculation (8 hpi). The expression of $\alpha$-DOX1 reached maximum levels 1 day after inoculation (1 dpi) and decreased at later intervals of time. A clearly different situation was found in sense line 16, which had the highest level of $\alpha$-DOX1 expression. In this line, high amounts of transcripts were detected in leaves prior to bacterial inoculation, and RNA content was little affected by bacterial treatment. In contrast, the amount of $\alpha$-DOX1 transcripts in the antisense line 5 was severely reduced compared with wild type plants, and only a weak hybridization signal was detected in RNA samples extracted at 8 hpi.

These results correlated well with the accumulation of $\alpha$-DOX1. Gel blot analyses with an antiserum raised against the $\alpha$-DOX1 protein revealed the presence of a protein band of ~75 kDa, i.e. the size predicted for the $\alpha$-DOX1 protein, in leaves of control plants responding to bacterial infiltration. The amount of $\alpha$-DOX1 protein increased significantly at 24 hpi and decreased to low level at the last time point examined, i.e. at 14 dpi. In accordance with the expression found in sense line 16, a high level of $\alpha$-DOX1 protein was detected in overexpressing plants at all the time intervals examined, and a slight transient increase in protein content could be observed at 4 dpi. In contrast to these results, accumulation of $\alpha$-DOX1 protein was almost undetectable in the antisense plants, and only a very small amount of protein was found at 1 dpi.

Analyses of plants responding to the compatible bacterium $P$. pv tabaci revealed similar results to those described above. As previously reported (7), $\alpha$-DOX1 expression was induced in wild plants after $P$. pv tabaci inoculation, although the accumulation of both RNA and protein showed a slight delay with respect to that found in the incompatible interaction. Results with sense line 16 revealed high levels of $\alpha$-DOX1 expression, whereas the presence of $\alpha$-DOX1 RNA and $\alpha$-DOX1 protein was almost undetectable in antisense line 5 treated with $P$. pv tabaci (data not shown).

Identification of $\alpha$-DOX and LOX Products in Tobacco Leaves—GC-MS analysis of derivatized extracts of wild type tobacco leaves revealed the presence of low levels of fatty acids, including linoleic and linolenic acids, the LOX products 9-HOT and 9,12,13-TriHOD, and the $\alpha$-DOX products 8,11,14-heptadecatrienoic acid and 2-HOT (Table I). On the other hand, 8,11,14-heptadecatrienal (earlier found to be the main product formed during the in vitro oxygenation of linolenic acid by $\alpha$-DOX1), and 13-HOT (13-LOX product of linolenic acid) were undetectable. A similar pattern was observed in tobacco leaves overexpressing $\alpha$-DOX1. Despite the considerable variability associated with determination of these low levels, the results indicated that resting tobacco leaves possess weak $\alpha$-DOX activity and that 2-HOT is the main $\alpha$-DOX product in vivo. The structures of the LOX products indicated that tobacco leaves metabolized linolenic acid in a similar way as recently recorded for leaves of potato (17, 25), i.e. by sequential action of 9-LOX, epoxy alcohol synthase and epoxide hydrolase. Notably, potato leaves produced mainly the trihydroxy oxylipin 9,10,11-TriHOD, whereas 9,12,13-TriHOD was the major trihydroxy isomer formed in tobacco leaves (Fig. 2).

Synthesis of $\alpha$-DOX and LOX Products in Infected Tobacco Leaves—Infection of tobacco leaves with $P$. pv syringae led to a rapid release of linoleic and linolenic acids. The peak values were observed at 8–24 hpi and amounted to 244 and 469 nmol/g leaves, respectively. A strong induction of $\alpha$-DOX products was also observed, i.e. 2-HOT (548 nmol/g at 1 dpi) and 8,11,14-heptadecatrienoic acid (47 nmol/g at 1 dpi) (Fig. 3). The main LOX products measured were 9-HOT (295 nmol/g at 1 dpi) and 9,12,13-TriHOD (359 nmol/g at 1 dpi). This product pattern was qualitatively similar to that observed in uninfected leaves (Table I and Fig. 2). Use of the bacterial strain $P$. pv tabaci led to a release of fatty acids that was about 7-fold lower than that observed with $P$. pv syringae. Also the accumulation of dioxygenase products was weaker with $P$. pv tabaci, i.e. a 4-fold lower yield of $\alpha$-DOX products and a more than 60-fold lower yield of LOX products (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the responses observed during infection with $P$. pv tabaci were delayed to 2–3 dpi.

FIG. 3. Time course of accumulation of free polyunsaturated fatty acids and $\alpha$-DOX and LOX products in tobacco leaves responding to bacterial inoculation. Control and transgenic plants, sense and antisense, were subjected to inoculation with an incompatible bacterium ($P$. pv syringae) inducing an HR defense response, or a compatible strain ($P$. pv tabaci), and products were determined by GC-MS. 18:2, linoleic acid; 18:3, linolenic acid; and 17:3, 8,11,14-heptadecatrienoic acid.

Synthesis of $\alpha$-DOX and LOX Products in Transgenic Tobacco Lines—Infection of tobacco plants overexpressing $\alpha$-DOX1 with $P$. pv syringae led to a massive accumulation of $\alpha$-DOX products, i.e. 1778 nmol/g 2-HOT and 86 nmol/g 8,11,14-heptadecatrienoic acid, corresponding to a 3-fold elevation compared with infected wild type plants. Notably, the yield of LOX products (120 nmol/g) were reduced 5.5-fold compared with wild type plants (Fig. 4). The data obtained with overexpressing $\alpha$-DOX1 plants infected with $P$. pv tabaci showed the same trend, i.e. a 4-fold elevation of $\alpha$-DOX products and a 2-fold lowering of LOX products (Fig. 4).

The amounts of $\alpha$-DOX products produced in $\alpha$-DOX1 antisense plants in response to $P$. pv syringae or $P$. pv tabaci were reduced 4-fold compared with wild type plants, however, zero levels were never observed (Fig. 4). The persisting $\alpha$-DOX products were qualitatively the same as those in wild type plants, i.e. 2-HOT and 8,11,14-heptadecatrienoic acid in proportions ranging from 10–20:1 at most time points. Presumably, these remaining levels of $\alpha$-DOX products were due to other $\alpha$-DOX

activity in tobacco leaves. A 1.3- to 3.6-fold elevation of LOX products was noted in $\alpha$-DOX1 antisense plants compared with wild type plants.

Identification of 2-Hydroxy Acids in Leaves of Infected Tobacco Plants—As mentioned above, when wild type tobacco plants or plants overexpressing $\alpha$-DOX1 were infected with the incompatible strain $P$. pv syringae, a strong accumulation of 2-HOT took place. Extracts of such leaves were analyzed by GC-MS for the presence of other endogenously produced 2-hydroxy acids. Authentic samples of 2-HOT, 2-hydroxyoleic acid, 2-hydroxystearic acid, and 2-hydroxypalmitic acid were used to allow unequivocal identification. Eleven 2-hydroxy acids differing with respect to chain length and number of double bonds could be identified, i.e. 2-hydroxy-18:3, 2-hydroxy-18:2, 2-hydroxy-18:1, 2-hydroxy-18:0, 2-hydroxy-17:3, 2-hydroxy-17:2, 2-hydroxy-17:0, 2-hydroxy-16:3, 2-hydroxy-16:1, 2-hydroxy-16:0, and 2-hydroxy-15:0. Of these compounds, 2-hydroxy-18:3 and 2-hydroxy-16:0 were the most abundant.

FIG. 4. Peak levels of products accumulating in tobacco leaves in response to bacterial infection. Levels of fatty acids (sum of linoleic and linolenic acids), $\alpha$-DOX products (sum of 2-HOT and 8,11,14-heptadecatrienoic acid), and LOX products (sum of 9-HOT, 9,12,13-TriHOD, 13-HOT, and 9,10,11-TriHOD). The time points in Fig. 3, which gave the highest level for each category, were selected for the calculation. SR1, wild type plants; Sense, $\alpha$-DOX1 sense transgenic plants; Antisense, $\alpha$-DOX1 antisense transgenic plants; syringae, *P. syringae* pv *syringae*; tabaci, *P. syr. pv tabaci*.

tized extracts of infected tobacco leaves were analyzed by GC-MS operated in the scan mode in search for new oxylipins. Peaks due to comparable amounts of two unknown compounds designated as Compound 1 and Compound 2 ($\mathrm{Me}_{3} \mathrm{Si}$ ether/ methyl ester derivatives) were observed in extracts from leaves of wild type or overexpressing plants infected with $P$. pv syringae but were undetectable in $\alpha$-DOX antisense plants and in all plants infected with $P$. pv tabaci. The compounds were present in the fraction of polar acidic lipids isolated by solid phase extraction, and their GC retention times (Compound 1, 13.6 min; Compound 2, 13.8 min) were intermediary to those of monohydroxy C$_{18}$ oxylipins (11.5–12.1 min) and trihydroxy C$_{18}$ oxylipins (14.1–14.4 min). The mass spectrum of derivatized Compound 2 showed a molecular ion at $m/z$ 468 suggesting the $\mathrm{Me}_{3} \mathrm{Si}$ derivative of a dihydroxylated triunsaturated octadecanoate methyl ester. A prominent ion at $m/z$ 223 ($\mathrm{Me}_{3} \mathrm{SiO}^{+}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\left(\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}\right)_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$) located one of the hydroxyl groups to the C-9 position, whereas the ion at $m/z$ 319 ($\mathrm{M}^{+}-(59+90)$; loss of $\mathrm{COOCH}_{3}+\mathrm{Me}_{3} \mathrm{SiOH}$) located the second one to the C-2 position. The mass spectrum of the derivatized Compound 2 was identical to that of the $\mathrm{Me}_{3} \mathrm{Si}$/ methyl ester derivative of an authentic specimen of $2(R), 9(S)$-dihydroxy-10$(E), 12(Z), 15(Z)$-octadecatrienoic acid. Catalytic hydrogenation shifted the GC retention time of Compound 2 to that of the $\mathrm{Me}_{3} \mathrm{Si}$ derivative of authentic methyl 2,9-dihydroxystearate, and the mass spectra recorded on the two compounds were identical. In the same way, Compound 1 was identified as $2,9$-dihydroxy-10$(E), 12(Z)$-octadecadienoic acid using mass spectrometry.

Because of the unavailability of the required deuterium-labeled standards, precise quantification of the doubly oxygenated oxylipins could not be performed by the GC-MS technique. However, using the intensities of the ions $m / z$ 399, 363, and 223, the peak levels of $2(R), 9(S)$-dihydroxy-10$(E), 12(Z), 15(Z)$-octadecatrienoic acid in wild type or $\alpha$-DOX sense tobacco leaves infected with $P$. pv syringae could be estimated to 20–35 and 60–100 nmol/g, respectively.

Sequences of the Biosynthesis of $\alpha$-DOX-LOX Double Oxygenation Products—Two pathways were conceivable for the biosynthesis of $2(R), 9(S)$-dihydroxy-10$(E), 12(Z), 15(Z)$-octadecatrienoic acid from linolenic acid in tobacco leaves, i.e. initial oxygenation at C-9 by 9-LOX to produce 9-HPOT followed by $\alpha$-DOX-catalyzed oxygenation at C-2, or the reversal of this sequence. Although it was not possible to distinguish between these possibilities in the in planta system, in vitro experiments were conducted to clarify the preferred pathways of the formation of doubly oxygenated oxylipins. In one set of experiments, $2(R)$-hydroxylinolenic acid was incubated with tomato fruit 9-LOX or recombinant potato tuber 9-LOX using conditions under which linolenic acid was efficiently oxygenated. No conversion into 2-hydroxy-9-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid (or other polar products) could be detected. On the other hand, incubation of 9-HOT (200 $\mu$M) with membrane-bound $\alpha$-DOX from cucumber fruit (8) for 20 min at 23 °C led to a mixture of $8(S)$-hydroxy-9$(E), 11(Z), 14(Z)$-heptadecatrienal and $2(R), 9(S)$-dihydroxy-10$(E), 12(Z), 15(Z)$-octadecatrienoic acid (see “Experimental Procedures”). In other experiments, $2(R)$-hydroxylinolenic acid was found to serve as an excellent substrate for

results (data not shown) revealed that none of the products inhibited the growth of $P$. pv tomato, $P$. pv maculicola, X. campestris pv campestris, or E. carotovora sp. carotovora. In contrast, a low concentration (11 $\mu$M) of 2(E)-hexenal, a short-chain hydroperoxide lyase-derived oxylipin, prevented the growth of all bacterial strains examined.

**Protective Effect against Cell Death—**The necrotic lesions produced in response to infiltration of bacterial suspensions into leaves were assessed in the absence or in the presence of varying concentrations of 2-HOT, 9-HOT, or 9,12,13-TriHOD added to the bacterial inoculum. As seen in Fig. 7, leaves developed necrotic lesions characteristic of an HR after inoculation with an incompatible strain of $P$. pv syringae. Thus, a weak necrotic response was observed at 24 hpi, whereas a strong necrotic aspect was apparent at 48 hpi (Fig. 7A). Inoculation of the compatible bacterium $P$. pv tabaci provoked symptoms characteristic of this infection, i.e. the appearance of small areas of disease necrosis and tissue chlorosis at 3–4 dpi (Fig. 7F). The extent of necrosis was strongly reduced when the bacterial suspensions contained 2-HOT or 9-HOT. The strongest activity was exerted by 2-HOT, which produced a clear reduction of cell death already at 50 $\mu$M concentration (Fig. 7, B and G), whereas smaller but still visible necrotic HR lesions were observed in leaves injected with $P$. pv syringae and 9-HOT (Fig. 7, D and E). Analyses of cell death by trypan blue staining was in accordance with visible symptoms and thus, the intensity of the coloration correlated precisely with the intensity of the necrosis formed (Fig. 7, K–U). In contrast to the results with 2-HOT and 9-HOT, addition of 9,12,13-TriHOD or linoleic acid to the bacterial inoculum did not cause any apparent alteration in the appearance of symptoms (data not shown). In other experiments, oxylipins alone were infiltrated (concentrations, 50 or 100 $\mu$M) and found to produce neither visible damage nor cell death in the corresponding area.

DISCUSSION

In vitro studies have shown that the dioxygenase reaction catalyzed by recombinant $\alpha$-DOX1 consists of stereospecific removal of the pro-R hydrogen from carbon-2 of the fatty acid chain followed by stereospecific introduction of molecular oxygen to provide a 2(R)-hydroperoxide derivative (8, 9). Because of their inherent chemical instability ($t_{1/2}$ in aqueous buffer at 23 °C, about 30 min), these hydroperoxides are further converted by non-enzymatic reactions to provide a one-carbon shortened fatty aldehyde (83%) accompanied by smaller amounts of the hydroxy acid (15%), and the next lower fatty acid homolog (2%). In the present study, lipids from tobacco leaves were fractionated by a solid-phase extraction procedure, and the materials obtained were assayed for the presence of $\alpha$-DOX products. In contrast to the in vitro results, the main linolenic acid-derived $\alpha$-DOX products in tobacco leaves were identified as 2-HOT (90–95%) and 8,11,14-heptadecatrienoic acid (5–10%), whereas aldehydes, including 8,11,14-heptadecatrienal were not detected. Apparently, in leaves the major metabolic fate of enzymatically generated fatty acid 2-hydroperoxides is reduction (Fig. 2). The nature of this reduction step is unknown but may involve peroxiredoxin (26) or other peroxidase activity. In this context it should be noted that the $\alpha$-DOX purified from pea seeds possesses an inherent peroxidase activity (11). Such activity is absent from recombinant tobacco $\alpha$-DOX1 (8), however, it cannot be excluded that it is exhibited by native $\alpha$-DOX1 in leaves. Irrespective of which peroxidase catalyzes reduction of 2-hydroperoxylinolenic acid and other 2-hydroperoxy acids, and of 9-HPOT and other LOX-derived hydroperoxides, it is apparent that this process will lead to consumption of considerable quantities of reducing equivalents (up to 1–2 $\mu$mol/g) in infected leaves.

FIG. 8. $\alpha$-Oxidation of linolenic acid (18:3) in intact tobacco leaves. Part of the 2-hydroperoxylinolenic acid escapes reduction and undergoes spontaneous decarboxylation to 8,11,14-heptadecatrienal, which is enzymatically dehydrogenated into 8,11,14-heptadecatrienoic acid (17:3). The sequence can then be repeated.

Infection of tobacco leaves with *Pseudomonas* led to release of linoleic and linolenic acids and a strong accumulation of $\alpha$-DOX and 9-LOX products (Fig. 3 and 4). 9-LOX-derived di- vinyl ethers and trihydroxy fatty acids have earlier been found to accumulate in leaves of potato in response to infection with the pathogenic fungus *P.* *infestans*, and at least the divinyl
ether fatty acids are believed to play a role in the defense against *Phytophthora* and other pathogens (5, 25). The pathogen-induced formation of α-DOX products in amounts comparable to those of 9-LOX products observed in the present study makes it necessary to take into account also the α-DOX-generated compounds, notably 2-hydroperoxy and 2-hydroxy fatty acids, as additional factors of potential importance in plant-pathogen interactions. In this context, the finding, that infection with the incompatible, HR-inducing bacterial strain *P.* pv syringae led to a 4-fold higher accumulation of α-DOX products compared with the compatible strain *P.* pv tabaci (Fig. 4), is of interest in view of the proposed role of the α-DOX pathway in protecting plant tissue from undergoing excessive necrosis during the HR response (14).

Tobacco leaves infected with *P.* pv syringae accumulated not only linolenic acid-derived α-DOX products but also 2-hydroxy derivatives of other fatty acids, including odd-numbered 2-hydroxy acids. The abundance of such compounds particularly in leaves from plants overexpressing α-*DOX1* gave strong support for the previously postulated involvement of α-DOX in the plant α-oxidation pathway for one-carbon shortening of fatty acids (8, 11). Formation of the main odd-numbered hydroxy acid, *i.e.* 2-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid, will require two steps of α-DOX-catalyzed oxygenation, the first of which will be followed by decarboxylation and the second by reduction (Fig. 8). It seems likely that the α-oxidation pathway in plants is controlled in part by peroxidase activity, which diverts the 2-hydroperoxides from the pathway.

Sense or antisense α-*DOX1* transgenic plants were developed *inter alia* to examine the possible interplay between the α-DOX and 9-LOX pathways during bacterial infection. Overexpressing plants responded to infection with *P.* pv syringae or *P.* pv tabaci with the accumulation of a major linolenic acid-derived oxylipin, *i.e.* 2-HOT, whereas this compound was a minor metabolite in infected antisense plants (Figs. 3 and 4). Interestingly, the amounts of α-DOX and LOX products varied reciprocally in transgenic plants, *i.e.* the increased formation of α-DOX products in overexpressing plants was accompanied by a reduced production of LOX products, whereas the opposite was true in α-*DOX1* antisense plants (Fig. 4). This finding indicated that α-DOX and LOX compete for a common pool of free fatty acids liberated in the course of the infection. Such a shunting effect would be expected to limit production of specific dioxygenase products, however, whether this is of biological relevance remains to be determined.

Cooperation of α-DOX and LOX resulting in the formation of doubly oxygenated fatty acid derivatives was observed during infection with the incompatible strain *P.* pv syringae. Thus, linolenic acid provided 2(*R*),9(*S*)-dihydroxy-10,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, the structure of which was confirmed by *e.g.* mass spectrometry, and linoleic acid was analogously transformed into 2(*R*),9(*S*)-dihydroxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid. Judging from *in vitro* experiments, these compounds were formed by α-DOX-catalyzed oxygenation of 9-oxygenated fatty acids, *i.e.* 9-LOX catalysis preceding α-DOX (Fig. 5).

Using α-DOX transgenic Arabidopsis plants we recently obtained evidence suggesting that one or more products generated through the α-DOX pathway protect hypersensitively reacting leaf tissue from undergoing excessive necrosis (14). Identification in the present study of 2-HOT as the major α-DOX product in infected leaf tissue prompted us to determine whether this oxylipin can act as a cell-protecting factor in infected leaves. Interestingly, administration of 50–100 µM 2-HOT together with the bacterial inoculum strongly reduced the extent of cell death (Fig. 7). A qualitatively similar but weaker effect was observed for 9-HOT, whereas the trihydroxy oxylipin 9,12,13-TriHOD was inactive. The mechanism behind this protective effect of 2-HOT and 9-HOT in infected leaves is unknown, although it could be excluded from *in vitro* experiments that a direct bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal effect was involved (Fig. 6). The striking parallel between the cell-protecting effect observed in infected tobacco leaves to the anti-inflammatory and protecting effect exerted by the lipoxins, a group of lipoxygenase-generated eicosanoids in animal tissue (27), deserves mentioning.
