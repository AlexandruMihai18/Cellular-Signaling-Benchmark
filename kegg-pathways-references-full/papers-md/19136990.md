This review will focus on the recent findings in adipose tissue metabolism with special attention to human adipocyte biology and physiology. There are major advances stemming from the concomitant results obtained from studies on mature human adipocytes, human preadipocytes differentiated *in vitro* and murine adipose cell lines. Physiological developments have been based on the expanded utilization of various kinds of murine transgenic models and physiological techniques such as microdialysis, open-flow microperfusion, arteriovenous techniques and the utilization of deuterium- or tritium-labelled metabolites that have provided a number of physiological advances in the understanding of human adipose tissue physiology. Gene expression profiling studies and nutrigenomics are emerging methods that herald interesting approaches for the future. An overview of recent discoveries in the mechanisms involved in the control of free fatty acid uptake, triacylglycerol synthesis and fat deposition will be discussed, as well as recent advances in the mechanisms involved in the lipolytic pathways, the role of lipases and perilipins. In addition, the *in vivo* validation of catecholamine action and the discovery of the lipolytic effects of natriuretic peptides will also be covered.

**Introduction**

Adipose tissue (AT) is a major source of metabolic fuel. The use of murine preadipose cell lines (that is, 3T3-L1, 3T3-F442A and ob-17 cells) together with molecular and cellular approaches in knockout and transgenic mice has expanded our knowledge of adipocyte and AT biology and physiology. Nevertheless, particularly in the field of metabolic regulation, the clinical relevance of results obtained with transgenic mice must be questioned. *In vitro* studies on isolated fat cells ${}^{1}$ or fat cell precursors differentiated into adipocytes *in vitro* ${}^{2,3}$ have provided a suitable system to explore fat cell biology and a number of regulatory mechanisms at the cell level. AT is not the easiest tissue to study for an integrated approach to its biology and physiology. Noticeable progress was made in the 1990s to improve such *in vivo* studies in humans, and reliable techniques are now available. The *in situ* microdialysis technique described by Lonnroth *et al.* ${}^{4}$ has been rapidly expanded and improved by other laboratories. ${}^{5-9}$ An open-flow microperfusion technique allows stable sampling of macromolecules from the interstitial space of AT. ${}^{10,11}$ Another useful technique to measure AT

metabolism has been introduced by the group of Frayn who described a relatively pure preparation of AT that could be studied by the arteriovenous technique. ${}^{12-14}$ Methods based on the utilization of deuterium- or tritium-labelled metabolites can also be used to assess triacylglycerol (TAG) turnover, storage, or mobilization. ${}^{15-17}$ Nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics that dominate research in diet-gene and gene-diet responsiveness in the field of personalized nutrition are rapidly expanding. ${}^{18,19}$ Gene expression profiling studies using rodent obesity models or humans have demonstrated that microarray analysis can successfully differentiate preadipocytes from adipocytes and identify the cellular responses to pharmacological agents and nutritional treatments. This review will focus on the recent findings in AT metabolism with particular attention to human adipocyte biology and physiology.

Recent discoveries in the mechanisms controlling free fatty acid uptake, triacylglycerol synthesis and fat deposition

Most energy reserves in the human body are stored in adipocytes as TAG, which may arise in the adipocyte from two major routes: *de novo* lipogenesis from non-lipid precursors or uptake of fatty acids from the plasma. Fatty acids move through the endothelial lining to the adipocytes,

where they are taken up; some of them escape adipocyte trapping and are transported by albumin to other tissues. A number of enzymes are involved in TAG accumulation in adipocytes including acyl-coenzyme A:diacylglycerol transferase (DGAT) which catalyses the addition of the third fatty acyl-CoA moiety to diacylglycerol, fatty acid synthase and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) which provide the non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) substrates for TAG synthesis. Fat cells and preadipocytes are remarkably resistant to cytotoxic effects of fatty acids.

De novo lipogenesis

De novo lipogenesis is the synthesis of fatty acid molecules from non-lipid substrates. AT de novo lipogenesis is observed in small animals, when the diet is rich in carbohydrate and low in fat. Liver, white AT, and the mammary glands (that is, during lactation) are the sites for de novo lipogenesis in mammals. In human AT, the key enzymes for fatty acid synthesis are present but the contribution of AT to whole-body lipogenesis is considered to be very low and less than that of liver.²⁰,²¹ It cannot be ruled out that de novo lipogenesis might operate to a significant extent in human AT when there is a need to dispose of 'excess' carbohydrate. Under normal conditions, the activity of ATP: citrate lyase, an important lipogenic enzyme, is very low in human AT.²² A comparison of lipogenesis in the AT of rat and humans fed diets of similar composition has confirmed that the capacity of the lipogenic pathway of AT is lower in humans than in rats. This difference appears to be related to the lower abundance of mRNA (that is, lower expression) of the two transcription factors controlling the lipogenic pathways: sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and carbohydrate response element-binding protein.²³

Lipoprotein lipase and TAG hydrolysis

The major route for TAG deposition in human white adipose tissue is the uptake of pre-existing fatty acids from circulating TAGs (existing in chylomicrons or very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles); the various steps are summarized in Figure 1. Chylomicrons acquire apolipoprotein E as well as apolipoprotein C from high-density lipoproteins in the systemic circulation. Acquisition of apolipoprotein CII is of major importance as it is a major cofactor of LPL. Circulating TAGs are also present in VLDL, the TAG-rich lipoproteins secreted by the liver. VLDL and chylomicron particles, too large to penetrate the endothelial lining of AT capillaries, must be processed in the luminal space. LPL is a 448-amino acid glycoprotein that is active as a dimer, and the catalytic triad responsible for the lipolysis and the heparin-binding domains of the enzyme has been identified.²⁴,²⁵ LPL is synthesized and secreted by the adipocytes and is translocated to the lumen of capillaries, through mechanisms that are not fully delineated. It is then bound to the luminal surface of endothelial cells by interaction with

![Figure 1](#fig1)

**Figure 1** Schematic illustration of the binding of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) by heparan sulfate proteoglycans and of a chylomicron particle by GPI-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) on the surface of a capillary microvascular endothelial cell. LPL-dependent lipolysis occupies a central position in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. LPL is a 448-amino acid glycoprotein synthesized by the adipocyte and transferred to the luminal pole of microvascular endothelial cells. LPL is active as a dimer and the catalytic triad (Ser-132, Asp-156 and His-241) responsible for lipolysis is located in the amino-terminal domain. LPL binds to heparin sulfate proteoglycans on cells, and specifically to the glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans. It is hypothesized that GPIHBP1 might be capable of binding LPL or chylomicrons, or both. Chylomicrons are rapidly metabolized; their residence time in the circulation is only a few minutes. Fatty acid trapping (for example, uptake by adipocytes of fatty acids liberated from LPL on chylomicron triacylglycerols-TAGs) represents an important buffering process of normal AT activity. The hydrolysis of lipoproteins (chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins produced by liver) TAGs by LPL provides non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) for storage as TAG in adipocytes. Uptake of NEFAs by adipocytes is enhanced by insulin and acylation-stimulating protein (ASP). ASP stimulates TAG synthesis through fatty acid trapping and glucose transport in adipocytes through a G-protein-coupled receptor. Untrapped NEFAs (that is, fatty acid leakage) will bind to albumin and flow outside the adipose tissue.

cell-surface glycosaminoglycans, especially heparin sulfate proteoglycans. Chylomicron apolipoprotein E, through its positively charged domains, may bind to negatively charged heparin sulfate proteoglycans lining the capillary wall and facilitate LPL-dependent lipolysis. However, it is not clearly established how TAG-rich lipoproteins are delivered to the active catalytic site of LPL.²⁶,²⁷ Apolipoprotein AV (Apo AV) has emerged as a possible intravascular regulator of the lipolysis of TAG-rich lipoproteins. Knockout mice lacking Apo AV had four times as much plasma TAG as controls.²⁸,²⁹ In humans, single nucleotide polymorphisms across the Apo AV locus were found to be significantly associated with plasma TAG levels.³⁰ A role for Apo AV in the regulation of lipolysis and in familial hyperchylomicronemia in humans has been proposed.³¹ Apo AV function may be related to the enhancement of binding between lipoproteins and proteoglycans at the vascular wall.³²,³³ To conclude, Apo AV might reduce TAG levels by guiding VLDL and chylomicrons to proteoglycan-bound LPL for lipolysis.

A previously identified glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein that facilitated the binding of high-density lipoproteins to cultured cells³⁴ has been shown to be important for the lipolytic processing of chylomicrons in

endothelial cells in mice. This GPI-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1), located on the luminal face of the capillary endothelium in AT, as well as heart and skeletal muscle, plays a crucial role in the processing of chylomicrons by LPL.³⁵ Lack of GPIHBP1 in mice promotes a large increase in plasma TAGs and an increased chylomicronemia, mimicking what happens with LPL deficiency.³⁶ Transfected host cells (that is, Chinese hamster ovary cells) expressing *Gpihbp1* gene avidly bind both chylomicrons and LPL. The molecular basis for chylomicron binding to GPIHBP1 is not completely understood, but the involvement of apolipoprotein ligands is suspected. GPIHBP1 harbors a strongly acidic negatively charged domain that could potentially bind to the positively charged domains of apolipoproteins contained in the chylomicron (for example, Apo-B48, Apo-E and Apo AV). The acidic domain may also serve as a binding site for LPL that contains positively charged heparin-binding domains. Further studies are required to delineate how GPIHBP1 might facilitate interactions between LPL and chylomicrons. This class of GPI-anchored binding proteins is known to exist as homodimers that may facilitate binding through dimerization.³⁷ It has been suggested that the GPI-anchored complex might cluster in raft domains in the plasma membrane thereby bringing LPL into contact with chylomicrons. The action of LPL to liberate fatty acids from the particulate TAG is thus facilitated. Future structure–function and binding studies are awaited to clarify these mechanisms. Identification of GPIHBP1 as a putative chylomicron/LPL receptor is an important milestone in the understanding of lipoprotein processing and delivery of nutrients to cells. Another open field concerns the factors involved in the regulation of GPIHBP1 expression in the endothelium of the various tissues involved in the control of TAG-rich lipoproteins lipolysis such as AT, skeletal muscle, and heart.³⁸ Several inherited disorders causing accumulation of chylomicrons in plasma have been described in humans, and therefore deficiencies of GPIHBP1, in addition to defects in LPL or Apo-CII, need to be explored.

LPL is upregulated in AT in the fed state; the pattern is reversed during fasting. Recent findings on the structure, function and regulation of LPL along with its important role in disease are found in the following reviews.²⁵,³⁹ Some AT-borne factors have been reported to interfere with LPL activity. Angiopoietin-like protein-4 inhibits LPL and retards lipoprotein catabolism, and changes in its mRNA levels in rat AT are inversely correlated to LPL activity, during both the fed-to-fasted and the fasted-to-fed transitions. Angiopoietin-like protein-4 is proposed to be a fasting-induced controller of LPL in AT, acting extracellularly on the native LPL conformation in an unusual fashion, like an unfolding molecular chaperone.⁴⁰ In obesity, AT LPL is not upregulated normally in the postprandial period,⁴¹,⁴² and the consequence on TAG clearance is not fully established as the total amount of LPL in the AT of the obese could be sufficient for an optimal effect.


Uptake of fatty acids and triacylglycerol synthesis

Fatty acid trapping (for example, uptake by adipocytes of fatty acids liberated from plasma TAGs by LPL) represents an important buffering process of normal AT activity.⁴³ The transport of free fatty acids across membranes remains controversial.⁴⁴ When cells are exposed to fatty acids, their intracellular pH drops as unionized, hydrophobic fatty acids that have diffused across the cell membrane are reionized.⁴⁵ Translocation of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) across the plasma membrane is achieved by a concert of co-existing mechanisms. They can diffuse passively, but transport can also be accelerated by certain membrane proteins as well as by the movement of lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are dynamic assemblies of proteins and lipids that float freely within the two dimensional matrix of the membrane bilayer.⁴⁶ Amphiphilic LCFA are hydrophobic molecules, poorly soluble in aqueous solutions, that can flip-flop rapidly across model membranes⁴⁷ and diffuse rapidly through the plasma membrane lipid bilayer when present in high concentration.⁴⁸,⁴⁹ However, the presence in the fat cell membrane of protein-mediated carrier systems, operating at low substrate concentrations, is now well accepted although some mechanisms are still debated.⁵⁰ The transport and metabolism of LCFA are now believed to be carried out by membrane-associated proteins that bind and transport LCFA. Among these proteins, the plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein has a similar amino acid composition and an identical amino acid sequence for residues 3–24 to the mitochondrial isoform of aspartate aminotransferase of rat liver.⁵¹ Its role in AT is poorly understood. A family of membrane-associated proteins termed fatty acid transport proteins (FATP) have been shown to enhance LCFA uptake. Two members of this family, designated FATP-1 and FATP-4, have been characterized in adipocytes. Insulin promotes the translocation of murine FATP-1 from an intracellular compartment to the fat cell plasma membrane, and this translocation parallels LCFA uptake.⁵² The mechanisms by which FATP mediate LCFA uptake are not well understood, but several studies provide evidence that the uptake of LCFA across cell membranes is closely linked to acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) activity. Amino acid sequences in the cytosolic section of FATP-1 contain the AMP-binding motif that mediates acyl CoA-synthase activity.⁵³ The primary sequence of the murine fatty acid transport protein (FATP-1) is very similar to that of the multigene family of very long-chain (C20–C26) ACSs.⁵⁴ A constitutive interaction between FATP-1 and long-chain ACS-1 contributes to the efficient cellular uptake of LCFAs in adipocytes through vectorial acylation.⁵⁵ Recent studies have clarified differences between FATP-1 and FATP-4. Both possess acyl-CoA-synthase-1 enzyme activity and share 60% sequence identity but each has a unique role in the adipocytes. FATP-1 plays a minor role in basal fatty acid uptake but a major role during insulin-stimulated fatty acid uptake, with its translocation to the membrane.⁵²,⁵⁶ FATP-4 is an intracellular protein with ACS activity that does not play a rate-limiting role in basal or insulin-regulated

fatty acid uptake. It seems to be involved in the control of intracellular free fatty acid levels in fatty acid re-esterification after lipolysis.⁵⁶ Concerning the regulation of FATP expression, insulin is the most important endocrine factor negatively influencing the expression of murine FATP whereas peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligands (that is, PPARγ and PPARα-agonists) induced an increase in FATP mRNA levels.⁵⁷,⁵⁸ In 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, the transcription of FABP-1 is negatively regulated by insulin and FATP levels are increased during starvation, which is associated with low insulin levels.⁵⁹ It is necessary to investigate whether changes in FATP-1 expression may contribute significantly to the alterations in fatty acid uptake by AT in obesity and/or type 2 diabetes.⁶⁰

Fatty acid translocase FAT/CD36 is involved in regulating the uptake of long-chain fatty acids into muscle cells. Evidence for a substantial role for facilitated diffusion with fatty acid translocase FAT/CD36 has also been provided in AT.⁶¹ The adipocytes of CD36 null mice lack the high affinity component of LCFA transport observed in wild type fat cells. CD36 null animals had higher fasting plasma levels of NEFAs and TAG, and the uptake of ³H-labeled oleate was significantly reduced in their adipocytes.⁶² Furthermore, reduced uptake of fatty acids *in vivo*, results in impaired TAG synthesis in WAT.⁶³ The contribution of FAT/CD36 to fatty acid metabolism has been investigated in 3T3-L1 cells. Binding assays revealed that [³H] fatty acids bind predominantly to FAT/CD36 within a plasma membrane fraction resistant to detergents whereas intracellular FAT/CD36 is found in non-lipid raft membranes. Lipid raft microdomains might control fatty acid uptake by regulating FAT/CD36 surface availability, and it was suggested that FAT/CD36 mediates raft-dependent LCFA uptake.⁶⁴ Caveolin-1 may also be involved in fatty acid uptake by regulating the surface availability of FAT/CD36.⁶⁵,⁶⁶ Despite the number of published investigations, the role of cell membranes in regulating the flux of LCFA into and out of adipocytes remains intensely debated, especially methodological limitations.⁴⁴ One group has recently concluded that fatty acid transport across the adipocyte plasma membrane is not mediated by FAT/CD36, FATP-1, plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein, caveolin-1 or lipid rafts, but by an as-yet-unidentified membrane protein pump.⁶⁷ According to the authors, although transport very likely occurs through a membrane-mediated mechanism, the properties of this system are more complex than described by NEFA uptake measurements.⁴⁴

Disturbances in fatty acid metabolism and increased plasma concentrations of NEFAs are involved in the etiology of insulin resistance and the related dyslipidemia, hypertension and procoagulant states. Differences in fatty acid transport and expression of transport and binding proteins could interfere with TAG synthesis in AT but also with a number of other NEFA-mediated intracellular actions. Their contribution in endoplasmic reticulum stress in the adipocyte of the obese remains to be investigated.⁶⁸ Concerning fatty acid transport, a study has revealed that the rate of

de novo TAG synthesis by omental AT was higher in African-American women than in Caucasian women. An increase in fatty acid transport, mediated by the overexpression of the transport proteins in the omental AT (that is, an increase in the mRNA and protein levels of FAT/CD36 and FATP-4) might contribute to the higher prevalence of obesity among African-American women.⁶⁰ An intronic polymorphism in the *FATP-1* gene is associated with increased plasma TAG levels⁶⁹,⁷⁰ whereas patients bearing a *FATP-4* gene polymorphism (that is, male heterozygotes for Gly 209 Ser) had lower BMI and plasma TAG levels.⁷¹ Both FATP-1 and FATP-4 have been associated with insulin resistance, although several issues remain to be resolved, for example whether increased FATP-mediated fatty acid uptake is beneficial or detrimental. Results depend on the tissue expressing the transporters and on the subsequent fate of the fatty acids.⁷²

The membrane transport of fatty acids is intimately linked to their 'activation' (esterification with coenzyme A).⁵⁶,⁷³ Fatty acid esterification to form TAG involves the sequential addition of acyl-CoA to a glycerol 'backbone' in adipocytes. There are two major pathways for TAG synthesis in mammals.⁷⁴ In the adipocytes, the major pathway is the phosphatidic acid pathway that starts with glycerol 3-phosphate. Esterification is under the control of insulin. TAG synthesis occurs primarily through DGAT that catalyses the final and only committed step in the glycerol phosphate pathway. Conversion of diacylglycerol to TAG at the level of DGAT is a critical step *in vivo* according to results obtained in transgenic mice.⁷⁵ Two different mammalian DGAT enzymes have been identified (that is, DGAT1 and DGAT2); the highest expression level is found in AT, liver and mammary gland. The genes encoding the two enzymes belong to different gene families that do not share sequence homology.⁷⁶,⁷⁷ Both are membrane-associated proteins that catalyze the reaction that produces TAG, but they exhibit different biochemical properties and substrate selectivity.⁷⁸ Inactivation of anabolic enzymes of fatty acid uptake and storage enhanced tissue glucose disposal or insulin secretion whereas disruptions in the catabolic process tended to impair insulin action or secretion.⁷⁹,⁸⁰ Overexpression of DGAT1 in AT yields a mouse that is more obese but also more insulin sensitive.⁸¹ In human AT, DGAT1 and fatty acid synthase expression are strongly correlated with insulin sensitivity. Their expression is higher in the AT of normal glucose-tolerant subjects compared with patients with impaired glucose tolerance.⁸² Treatment of humans, mice, and cultured adipocytes with the antidiabetic drugs, thiazolidinediones, increased *DGAT1* and fatty acid synthase (*FASN*) gene expression and improved insulin sensitivity.⁸² Regulation of TAG synthesis in AT is stimulated by insulin at multiple stages; the net effect of insulin on TAG stores is strongly 'anabolic'.⁸³ The role of acylation-stimulating protein/C3adesArg (ASP) in regulating lipid metabolism has primarily focused on its participation in the stimulation of TAG synthesis. ASP stimulates TAG synthesis through fatty

acid trapping and glucose transport in preadipocytes/adipocytes through a G-protein-coupled receptor. 84–86

**Glyceroneogenesis in adipocytes**

Under normal conditions, the major route for the retention of fatty acids in adipocytes is re-esterification. It is a highly regulated process controlled by insulin and other factors 87 such as the insulin-sensitizing agents, thiazolidinediones (TZD). During fasting, the quantity of NEFAs released is the result of a balance between TAG breakdown and resynthesis. A significant proportion of the NEFAs could be re-esterified into TAG in a futile cycle within the fat cell. Re-esterification requires the formation of glycerol-3-P through phosphorylation of glycerol or glyceroneogenesis, defined as the *de novo* synthesis of glycerol-3-P from pyruvate, lactate or certain amino acids. 88 Adipocytes were generally considered to be devoid of glycerol kinase, but in rodents, TZDs have been shown to induce expression of the glycerol kinase (Gk) gene to increase glycerol kinase levels, enhancing glycerol-3-phosphate incorporation into TAG and reduce NEFA secretion from adipocytes. It was claimed that the process could be a novel mechanism to reduce NEFA levels and perhaps promote insulin sensitization by antidiabetic therapies. 89 However, a ‘futile metabolic cycle’ involving glycerol is not induced in AT in humans treated with rosiglitazone, and does not contribute to the metabolic actions of TZDs in humans. 90 Larger studies will be needed to determine the extent to which TZD induction of adipose glycerol kinase varies in humans and whether this correlates with a reduction in NEFA levels. Re-esterification also requires glyceroneogenesis, and the key enzyme in this process is the cytosolic isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C; EC 4.1.1.32). 88 In addition to glycerol kinase, this enzyme is also induced by TZD treatment in rodent and human adipocytes. 91,92 Recent advances have stressed the role of glyceroneogenesis and of PEPCK-C in the control of fatty acid release from AT. 93 Promoting the pathways that contribute to increased re-esterification of fatty acids is probably an attractive strategy to limit fatty acid release during fasting and even exercise. 43 This pathway might represent a promising target for pharmacological intervention by insulin-sensitizing agents such as the TZDs. 94

**Recent discoveries in mechanisms involved in the control of fat mobilization**

Fat mobilization is under the control of powerful mechanisms. 43,95,96 To use the AT energy reserves (for example, during fasting and exercise), ATTAG must first be hydrolyzed and the resultant fatty acids (that is, NEFAs) delivered to the working muscle. This is achieved by a highly active and regulated pathway: lipolysis, whereby TAGs stored in the adipocyte are hydrolyzed, and fatty acids delivered to the plasma. 97,98 Release from AT of the products of lipolysis is

pulsatile in dogs 99 and in humans. 100 *In vivo* studies based on the use of tracer methodology have clearly shown that lipolytic activity is greater in upper-body subcutaneous than in leg AT (per kg of fat) in lean and obese men and women. 17,101

**Lipases: more than just one lipase**

The rate-limiting step in AT lipolysis is the hydrolysis of TAG by lipases. The hydrolysis of stored TAG involves several lipases and lipid droplet-associated proteins such as perilipins. TAGs are broken down into diacylglycerols (DAG), and then into monoacylglycerols; the final step generates fatty acids and glycerol. Hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) is a multifunctional enzyme that possesses TAG, DAG, cholesterol ester and retinyl ester hydrolase activities. 97 HSL is diffusively distributed throughout the fat cell cytosol in unstimulated conditions. Upon stimulation of lipolytic pathways and its phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or protein kinase G (PKG), HSL is translocated to the surface of lipid droplets coated with perilipin. Perilipin coats lipid droplets and suppresses lipolysis by blocking access of the lipases to the lipid droplet under basal conditions. 102 Perilipin phosphorylation seems to be essential for the fragmentation and dispersion of the lipid droplets and full lipolytic stimulation. 103–105 Another regulator of HSL is adipocyte lipid-binding protein, also known as adipocyte protein aP2 and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4). FABP4 gene knockout mice exhibit decreased lipolytic capacity. 106 FABP4 interacts with the amino-terminal region of HSL and forms an FABP4-HSL complex. 107 The complex is translocated to the surface of the lipid droplets upon lipolytic stimulation; the lipolytic activity of HSL is increased through its ability to bind and sequester NEFAs through specific protein–protein interactions.

In addition to HSL, a novel lipase, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), belonging to a family of closely related proteins containing a patatin-like domain, has been discovered. 108–111 In a mouse fat cell line, overexpression of ATGL-stimulated basal and catecholamine-induced lipolysis, whereas a knockdown of the enzyme had the opposite effect. 112 In mice, ATGL seems to participate in stimulated lipolysis because ATGL deficiency caused a drastic reduction in stimulated lipolysis, and ATGL is required for PKA-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes derived from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. 103,113 ATGL has an exclusive TAG-hydrolyzing activity. It is activated by a cofactor, comparative gene identification CGI-58, also called ABHD5 (for α/β hydrolase fold domain 5). 114 ABHD5 is a coactivator of ATGL, stimulating TAG hydrolysis by as much as 20-fold. 115 ABHD5 interacts with perilipins on the surface of the lipid droplets and a complex interplay has been proposed between ATGL, perilipins and ABHD5. 116 There is little evidence that additional lipases besides ATGL and HSL are involved in TAG hydrolysis in rodent fat cells as these two enzymes are responsible for >95% of the TAG-hydrolysing activity in

mouse fat cells.¹¹⁵ The final step in the hydrolysis of triglycerides is catalyzed by monoacylglycerol lipase, an abundant lipase not hormonally regulated.¹¹⁷

The respective roles of HSL and ATGL in human fat cell lipolysis have not been well established at present. HSL, but not ATGL, shows significant DAG lipase activity that is 10-fold higher than its TAG lipase activity and thus TAGs are hydrolyzed at a lower rate than DAGs, indicating that the first step of lipolysis is rate limiting. Both PKA and PKG phosphorylate and activate human HSL. Use of a specific HSL inhibitor suggests that the catecholamine and natriuretic peptide pathways converge on HSL to induce lipolysis in human fat cells, and that ATGL participates in basal lipolysis.¹¹⁸ HSL inhibition completely inhibits stimulated lipolysis, but only reduces basal lipolysis by 50%. *In vitro* studies suggest that the ATGL cofactor, ABHD5, is less efficient in stimulating human than mouse ATGL.¹¹⁴ In the absence of this factor, the lipase activity of ATGL is much lower than that of HSL in protein extracts of human AT.¹¹⁹ The pathway by which fatty acids leave the adipocyte is not clear. As mentioned earlier, facilitated diffusion by FAT/CD36 and FABP4 seems to be associated with fatty acid transport.

Glycerol is also produced during lipolysis and its release from adipocytes or AT is often taken as a marker of lipolysis, as AT expresses relatively low levels of glycerol kinase activity. Glycerol moves across the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion, using a member of the aquaporin channel family, aquaporin 7 (AQP7), which has recently emerged as a modulator of adipocyte metabolism. *Aqp7* knockout mice develop obesity and hyperglycemia.¹²⁰,¹²¹ AQP7 downregulation could be pathogenic for obesity and/or type 2 diabetes.¹²²,¹²³ Among several single nucleotide polymorphisms identified, the A-953G identified in the AQP7 promoter was associated with decreased AQP7 expression in adipose tissue from AA to AG to GG individuals.¹²⁴ Expression of AQP7 is downregulated in women with severe obesity although the expression of this glycerol channel is not affected by type 2 diabetes.¹²⁵

**Lipolytic pathways and lipolytic hormones: in vivo validation of catecholamine action and discovery of the lipolytic effects of natriuretic peptides**

Fat mobilization is regulated by various mechanisms in humans. It is acutely stimulated by catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) and natriuretic peptides. Human fat cells express both β₁₋₂ and α₂-adrenergic receptors. Acting through binding to β₁₋₂-adrenoceptors, catecholamines stimulate adenyl cyclase and promote cAMP production from ATP. Conversely, selective stimulation of fat cell α₂-adrenergic receptors inhibits lipolysis (Figure 2). In fact, the final response is modulated according to the receptor number, the affinity of both receptors for catecholamines and post-receptor coupling events.⁹⁶ In the case of β-adrenergic responsiveness, several papers have claimed that β₃-adrenergic receptors were important regulators of human fat cell lipolysis, although *in vitro* assays have clearly shown that human fat cell lipolysis is essentially regulated by β₂- and β₁-adrenergic receptor stimulation.¹²⁶,¹²⁷ Despite some reports on isolated fat cells,¹²⁸ the studies performed to date have been unable to demonstrate convincingly that under physiological conditions, human fat cell β₃-adrenergic receptors contribute significantly to the regulation of lipid mobilization, energy expenditure or lipid oxidation in humans.⁸,¹²⁹

Site-related differences in the *in vitro* effects of catecholamines have been reported in fat cells from men and women.¹³⁰⁻¹³² An enhanced α₂-adrenergic responsiveness associated with a concomitant decrease in β-adrenergic responsiveness explains the lower lipolytic effect of catecholamines in gluteal/femoral fat cells of normal and obese women and abdominal fat cells of obese men. Conversely, visceral adipocytes show the highest β₁₋₂-adrenergic receptor-mediated lipolytic responsiveness and the weakest α₂-adrenergic response to catecholamines. Whatever the age and sex, the extent of the fat mass and the level of fat cell hypertrophy strongly affect the functional balance between β₁₋₂ and α₂-adrenergic receptors. The hypertrophic subcutaneous fat cells (abdominal, femoral) are known to be less responsive to the lipolytic action of catecholamines; they have the highest number of α₂-adrenergic receptors and the lowest number of β₁₋₂ adrenergic receptors. Physiological confirmation of *in vitro* results has been obtained using the *in situ* microdialysis technique. The relative contribution of β₁₋₂ and α₂-adrenergic receptors in the control of lipolysis has been defined *in vivo*. The physiological stimulation of subcutaneous AT adipocyte α₂-adrenergic receptors (that is, that outnumber β₁₋₂ adrenergic receptors in this AT depot) during exercise-induced sympathetic nervous system activation contributes to the reduced lipolysis noted in obese men.¹³³ The importance of the α₂-component has been validated in various kinds of patients.¹³⁴⁻¹³⁷

Our laboratory has shown that factors secreted by the heart, that is, atrial-natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide, stimulate lipolysis in human fat cells through a cGMP/PKG-signaling pathway independent of cAMP production and PKA activity. Natriuretic peptides act through the type A natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR-A) encoded by the *NPR1* gene, which possesses a guanylyl cyclase activity that generates the second messenger, cGMP. The two second messengers, cAMP and cGMP, whose production is activated by the lipolytic hormones, stimulate their corresponding protein kinases (that is, PKA and PKG), phosphorylate HSL and perilipin and activate lipolysis. The different elements of the pathway are detailed in Figure 2. The contribution of natriuretic peptides to the physiological control of lipid mobilization has been validated by various clinical studies. Administration of ANP and/or physiological increase (exercise, head-down bed rest) in plasma ANP levels stimulates lipid mobilization in humans.¹³⁸⁻¹⁴⁰ This pathway becomes of major importance during chronic treatment

Figure 2 The lipolytic pathways in human adipocytes. Signal transduction pathways for catecholamines through $\beta$- and $\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors, for atrial natriuretic peptide through type A receptor (NPR-A) and for insulin are summarized. Intracellular cAMP concentrations are controlled by: (i) catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) through $\beta$-adrenergic receptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation, (ii) inhibitory receptors (that is, $\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors, adenosine, prostaglandin, neuropeptide Y/peptide YY and nicotinic acid) through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity and (iii) insulin through cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3B activation of phosphodiesterase 3B. ANP and B-type natriuretic peptide stimulate NPR-A-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity and cGMP production. cAMP and cGMP both contribute to the protein kinase (PKA and PKG (cGK-I))-dependent phosphorylation of HSL and perilipin. Perilipin phosphorylation induces an important physical alteration of lipid droplet surfaces that facilitates the action of HSL on TAG hydrolysis. Moreover, perilipin phosphorylation releases a coactivator of ATGL, which promotes its TAG-hydrolyzing activity (not shown). HSL phosphorylation promotes its translocation from the cytosol to the surface of the lipid droplet. PKA and PKG (cGK-I) phosphorylate a number of other substrates (enzymes and transcription factors, not shown in the diagram) and can also influence the secretion of various molecules from adipocytes. Stimulation of insulin receptors counteracts cAMP production through cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3B stimulation of phosphodiesterase 3B and is without effect on cGMP production. The products of the complete hydrolysis of triacylglycerols (that is, NEFAs and glycerol) are released by fat cells. Docking of FABP4 to HSL favors the efflux of NEFA whereas glycerol is channelled by aquaporin-7 (AQP-7), a water-glycerol transporter that is present in the adipocyte plasma membrane.

with $\beta$-adrenergic receptor antagonists that inhibit catecho- lamine-induced lipolysis but enhance cardiac ANP release; an action that explains the maintenance of lipolysis in such patients. ${ }^{141}$ The existence of the ANP-dependent pathway raises interesting questions concerning its involvement in various physiological and pathological conditions (for example, congestive heart failure, cachexia, and so on).

The effects of other lipolytic factors, such as tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) and interleukin-6, are characterized by a delayed stimulation of lipolysis. A lipolytic action of TNF-$\alpha$ appears only after a long-lasting exposure of adipocytes to the cytokine, ${ }^{142}$ that is an activator of TAG hydrolysis in fat cells, but the mechanism of action is rather complex. Three separate mechanisms have been proposed: one is an alteration of insulin receptor-mediated signalling and of the antilipolytic effect of the hormone, while another proposes the inhibition of the antilipolytic action of adenosine that is mediated by adenosine-$A_1$ receptor signaling and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$-mediated alteration of Gi-coupling alters the antilipolytic action of adenosine. The third mechanism is a direct stimulation

of the basal rate of lipolysis through interactions with perilipin. ${ }^{142}$

Antilipolytic pathways: the neglected side of lipolysis regulation Lipolysis and fat mobilization is also under powerful inhibitory control by various hormones and secreted factors. Fat mobilization is potently suppressed by insulin acting through its usual signalling pathway for the control of acute metabolic events, that is, through phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase and protein kinase B activation, which in turn phosphorylates and activates phosphodiesterase 3B, which hydrolyses cAMP to AMP and reduces the lipolytic activity. Several other antilipolytic pathways that involve $\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors, $A_1$-adenosine-receptors, EP$_3$-prostaglandin E$_2$ receptors and neuropeptide Y/peptide YY (NPY-1) receptors have been identified in human fat cells. These receptors (all with seven-transmembrane domains) are coupled to adenylyl cyclase through Gi inhibitory GTP-binding proteins, and their stimulation reduces cAMP levels and inhibits lipolysis. In mice, NPY has recently been demonstrated to be involved

International Journal of Obesity

in visceral fat obesity induced by stress: knockdown of the NPY receptor reduced the extent of visceral fat.¹⁴³ The role of NPY in stress-related events with respect to human fat remains to be established. The recent discovery of inhibitory nicotinic acid receptors (for example, HM74a in humans/ PUMA-G in mice) explains the well-known antilipolytic action of nicotinic acid.¹⁴⁴,¹⁴⁵ Nicotinic acid inhibits lipolysis through PUMA-G, a Gi/o-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor expressed in mouse adipocytes. The nature of the physiological ligand(s) of such receptors remains an open question. (D)-β-hydroxybutyrate inhibits lipolysis in mouse adipocytes through the nicotinic acid receptor PUMA-G, but the effects in human fat cells are unknown and the affinity for the HM74a receptor is very low.¹⁴⁶ Nicotinic acid (niacin) has long been used as an antidyslipidemic drug:¹⁴⁷ it inhibits fat mobilization in AT leading to a lowering of plasma NEFAs that has many metabolic implications. The antilipolytic effect initiated by stimulation of the human fat cell HM74a receptor probably partly contributes to the antidyslipidemic action. However, the clinical use is limited because of the strong flushing response as a result of HM74a receptor-dependent release of PGE₂ and PGD₂, most likely from immune cells of the skin.¹⁴⁸

This multiplicity of endocrine but also local factors that controls lipolysis reflects the precise adjustment of fatty acid delivery to the circulation. The number of factors involved in the positive/negative regulation of adenylyl cyclase suggests that the cellular cAMP concentration is probably the major integrator for the regulation of fat mobilization. It remains to establish the exact role of the ANP-activated cGMP pathways in the physiological control of lipolysis.

Oxidative capacity of human white AT

In rodents and humans, fatty acid oxidation is not a major pathway in white adipocytes and cannot play an important role in the prevention of fatty acid release. It is understandable that the fatty acids released into the cytosol can be removed by mitochondrial β-oxidation. The endogenous fatty acids in adipocytes could be actively oxidized but in a recent study in normal fed rats, 0.2% of endogenous fatty acids were oxidized, 50.1% were released and 49.7% were re-esterified. Fasting doubled the partitioning of fatty acids toward oxidation, but it remains to be seen whether a small shift of fatty acids toward oxidation could have a significant impact on body fuel economy.¹⁴⁹ Human white adipocytes contain rather large numbers of mitochondria in the cytosolic compartment but O₂ consumption per kg of wet weight of human AT is about one-tenth that of resting skeletal muscle and is not significantly modified in obesity or insulin resistance.¹⁵⁰ In the postprandial state, it was shown that fatty acid oxidation represented only a small percent of the rate of fatty acid release from adipocytes.¹⁵¹ It has recently been proposed that elevated fatty acid concentrations in the cytosol of adipocytes induce mitochondrial uncoupling and thereby allow mitochondria to remove much larger quantities of fatty acids. By this mechanism, it was proposed that release of fatty acids out of adipocytes into the circulation could be prevented,¹⁵² but the importance of this pathway has recently been questioned and discussed.¹⁵³ Assessment of the oxidative capacity of white AT has been obtained after expression of the gene encoding the transcriptional coactivator PGC1-α in human adipocytes. The ectopic expression of PGC1-α induces the expression of the uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) gene and switches on genes involved in the fatty acid oxidation and the mitochondrial respiratory chain. As clearly established in brown fat cells, this protein of the inner membrane of mitochondria uncouples O₂ consumption from ATP synthesis.¹⁵⁴ An expression of glycerol kinase was also observed after the ectopic expression of PGC1-α and fatty acid re-esterification could be enhanced.¹⁵⁵ In the face of such experimental in vitro results in human mature adipocytes, it was proposed that increased expression of PGC-1α and protein content in human fat cells may favor the use of fatty acids within the adipocyte and limit their release into the bloodstream.¹⁵⁶

Future trends

The processes controlling the energy balance as well as the regulation of the intermediary lipid and carbohydrate metabolism are intricately controlled by neurohumoral mediators. The coordination of the biochemical and molecular pathways involved underlies, at least in part, the large number of intracellular and secreted proteins with autocrine, paracrine and endocrine effects produced by AT. The discoveries that AT secretes a plethora of pleiotropic adipokines at the same time and that adipocytes express receptors for a huge range of compounds will lead to a greater understanding of the functions of AT at both the basic and clinical level. The factors that determine body fat distribution still remain unknown. The combinations of genetic, hormonal and nutritional factors that promote fat accumulation in some fat deposits relative to other deposits remain to be clarified in humans. New experimental approaches are required to address such issues.

The application of microarrays has broadened the study of the patterns of gene expression in health and disease in AT. Interestingly, the wide spectrum of genes expressed in AT samples of obese patients underlines the view of an extraordinarily active and plastic tissue. Starting from a list of several hundred genes identified with DNA microarrays and using adapted bioinformatic tools, it is possible to identify biological processes affected by nutritional and pharmacological challenges. Gene expression studies can easily be performed on subcutaneous AT obtained by needle-biopsy aspiration. In the near future, they could be used for a better individual characterization of obese patients.¹⁵⁷

The discovery of the 'low grade inflammatory state' in obesity and of macrophage and T cell infiltration in the AT of obese rodents and obese patients opens new perspectives in the search for the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of obesity comorbidities. Adipose tissue macrophages have been shown to exert a marked proangiogenic effect on AT-derived endothelial and progenitor cells. Most of the processes leading to angiogenesis in AT remain to be clarified. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms leading to the inflammatory state and controlling macrophage infiltration are also poorly known. Given the central role played by endothelial cells in the control of inflammation, the knowledge of their biology in AT vasculature is important to our understanding of the inflammation in AT and related metabolic disorders.
