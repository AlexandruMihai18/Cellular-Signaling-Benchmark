## Summary

*Mycobacterium tuberculosis* produces a series of major secreted proteins, the fibronectin-binding proteins (Fbps), also known as the antigen 85 complex, that are believed to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis through their mycolyltransferase activity required for maintaining the integrity of the bacterial cell envelope. Four different *fbp* genes are found in the genome of *M. tuberculosis*, but the reason for the existence of these Fbps sharing the same substrate specificity *in vitro* in mycobacteria is unknown. We have shown previously that, in the heterologous host, *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, FbpA, FbpB and FbpC can all add mycolyl residues to the cell wall arabinogalactan and that, in *M. tuberculosis*, the cell wall mycolylation decreases by 40% when *fbpC* is knocked out. To investigate whether the remaining 60% mycolylation came from the activity of FbpA and/or FbpB, *fbpA-* and *fbpB*-inactivated mutant strains were biochemically characterized and compared with the previously studied *fbpC*-disrupted mutant. Unexpectedly, both mutants produced normally mycolylated cell walls. Overproduction of FbpA, FbpB or FbpC, but not FbpD, in the *fbpC*-inactivated mutant strain of *M. tuberculosis* restored both the cell wall-linked mycolate defect and the outer cell envelope permeability barrier property. These results are consistent with all three enzymes being involved in cell wall mycolylation and FbpC playing a more critical role than the others or, alternatively, FbpC is able to compensate for FbpA and FbpB in ways that these enzymes cannot compensate for FbpC, pointing to a partial redundancy of Fbps. In sharp contrast, FbpD does not appear to be an active mycolyltransferase enzyme, as it cannot complement the *fbpC*-inactivated mutant. Most importantly, application of Smith degradation to the cell walls of transformants demonstrated that the multiple Fbp enzymes are redundant rather than specific for the various arabinogalactan mycolylation regions. Neither FbpA nor FbpB attaches mycolyl residues to specific sites but, like FbpC, each enzyme transfers mycolyl residues onto the four sites present in the arabinogalactan non-reducing end hexaarabinosides.

## Introduction

Tuberculosis, a severe human disease, remains a major public health problem with millions of deaths annually worldwide. The aetiological agent of the disease, *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, is a facultative intracellular pathogen that possesses a complex envelope of unusually low permeability, which contributes to its resistance to host defence mechanisms (Brennan and Nikaido, 1995; Draper, 1998). Schematically, going from the plasmic to the external side of the bacteria, the cell envelope is composed of a plasma membrane, a complex wall composed of a variety of covalently linked and non-covalently linked carbohydrates and lipids and an outer layer, also called a capsule, of polysaccharides and proteins with small amounts of lipids (Daffé and Draper, 1998). The mycobacterial cell wall and capsule are typified by the presence of unusual long-chain fatty acids, the so-called mycolic acids, α-alkyl β-hydroxy C60–C90 fatty acids (Barry *et al.*, 1998; Daffé and Draper, 1998). These compounds are believed to play a central role both in the architecture of the cell wall (Brennan and Nikaido, 1995; Draper, 1998) and in the physiology of mycobacteria, their synthesis

being one of the targets of the antituberculous drug isoniazid (Banerjee *et al.*, 1994; Vilchèze *et al.*, 2000). Consequently, many attempts have been made to identify the enzymes involved in the metabolism of such specific compounds.

Among the increasing number of enzymes recently identified as being involved in cell envelope biogenesis are the three dominant secreted proteins of *M. tuberculosis*, antigens 85A, 85B and 85C, the so-called antigen 85 complex (Wiker and Harboe, 1992); all three proteins are closely related, sharing 68–80% identity at the amino acid level (Content *et al.*, 1991), and exhibit the capacity to bind fibronectin (Abou-Zeid *et al.*, 1988; 1991). For this reason, they are named fibronectin-binding proteins (Fbps). The purified Fbps have recently been shown, in an *in vitro* enzymatic assay (Belisle *et al.*, 1997), to catalyse the transfer of a mycolyl residue from one molecule of α,α′-trehalose monomycolate (TMM) to another TMM, leading to the formation of α,α′-trehalose dimycolate (TDM, cord factor). These two glycolipids are present in the outer-most cell envelope compartment of all the mycobacterial species examined so far, with the notable exception of *Mycobacterium leprae*, in which only TMM has been detected. Interestingly, a trehalose analogue, which inhibits *in vitro* up to 60% of the antigen 85C mycolyltransferase activity and inhibits the synthesis of trehalose mycolates and cell-bound mycolates to a certain extent in this bacterium, has been shown to have a bacteriostatic action on *Mycobacterium aurum* (Belisle *et al.*, 1997). Thus, in the context of the resurgence of tuberculosis and the emergence of multidrug-resistant mycobacteria, the biogenesis and traffic of mycolic acids remain an attractive field of research with the hope that the full definition of the metabolic pathway leading to these major and specific constituents of mycobacteria will lead to the development of new antituberculosis drugs. Fbps are encoded by three independent genes, *fbpA*, *fbpB* and *fbpC*, present in the genomes of *M. tuberculosis*, *M. leprae* and *Mycobacterium avium* and have been identified in all the filtrates of mycobacterial species examined so far. In addition, a fourth gene, named *fbpD* and encoding MPT51 whose primary structure is very similar to that of antigen 85 (Ohara *et al.*, 1995), was identified after the completion of the *M. tuberculosis* genome sequence (Cole *et al.*, 1998). Inactivation of *fbpC* of *M. tuberculosis* results in a 40% decrease in the amount of cell wall-linked mycolate content and an alteration of the permeability of the *M. tuberculosis* cell envelope (Jackson *et al.*, 1999). A similar observation has been made in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, a bacterium that possesses a cell envelope similar to that of mycobacteria (Puech *et al.*, 2001) and produces short-chain (C30–C36) mycolic acids (corynomycolates); disruption of *csp1*, a gene that encodes the Fbp-like secreted protein PS1 of *C. glutamicum* (Joliff *et al.*, 1992), leads to

a 50% decrease in the amount of cell wall-linked corynomycolate content and an alteration in the permeability of the *C. glutamicum* cell envelope (Puech *et al.*, 2000).

Although the disruption of *csp1* in *C. glutamicum* causes an accumulation of TMM with a concomitant decrease in TDM (Puech *et al.*, 2000), no apparent alteration in the relative amounts of TMM and TDM was observed in the *fbpC*-inactivated strain of *M. tuberculosis* (Jackson *et al.*, 1999). In addition, overproduction of FbpA–C in the *csp1*-disrupted strain of *C. glutamicum* restores both the cell wall-linked mycolate content and the outer permeability barrier of the recipient strain, but not the TMM and TDM content. Thus, it was concluded that Fbps transfer mycolyl residues onto the cell wall arabinogalactan (Puech *et al.*, 2000). A more recent study, however, has shown that no definitive conclusion can be drawn from the data obtained from the overproduction of a protein in a heterologous host (Glickman *et al.*, 2001). Production of Cma2 (CmA2), a methyltransferase from *M. tuberculosis*, in *Mycobacterium smegmatis* led to the transformation of the proximal cis-double of α-mycolates of the recipient strain to a cis-cyclopropane ring (George *et al.*, 1995); however, the disruption of *cmaA2* in *M. tuberculosis* has no effect on α-mycolates of the strain but causes the accumulation of unsaturated derivatives of oxygenated mycolates (Glickman *et al.*, 2001). Therefore, the observed transfer of corynomycolic acid residues upon the overproduction of the mycobacterial FbpA–C in *C. glutamicum* does not necessarily establish the function of these proteins in mycobacteria.

To gain further insight into the functions of the individual Fbps in mycobacterial physiology, the present study addressed the question of the redundancy of these proteins. We first investigated the consequence of the inactivation of *fbpA* and *fbpB* on the cell wall mycolate content. Based on the effects of the inactivation of *fbpC*, it would follow logically that the 60% mycoloylation came from FbpA and/or FbpB. Accordingly, *fbpA-* and *fbpB*-inactivated mutant strains (Armitige *et al.*, 2000) were biochemically characterized. To establish firmly the nature of the acceptors of mycolyl residues transferred by FbpA and FbpB in mycobacteria, the *fbpC*-disrupted mutant of *M. tuberculosis* was complemented with the various *fbp* genes. Finally, the specificity of the various Fbps in terms of attachment of mycolyl residues to the possible sites of cell wall arabinogalactan of *M. tuberculosis* was established by analysing the chemical structure of the cell walls of the transformants.

a. LAa1 and LAb1 correspond, respectively, to the $fbpA$- and $fbpB$-deficient mutant strains derived from the H37Rv strain of $M$. tuberculosis as described by Armitige et al. (2000). MYC1554 corresponds to the $fbpC$-inactivated strain derived from a clinical isolate (Mt103) of $M$. tuberculosis (Jackson et al., 1999). The various $fbp$ genes were overexpressed in MYC1554 as described in Experimental procedures. Strains were grown on the supplemented Middlebrook 7H9 medium for 9–15 days and then extracted with organic solvents (see Experimental procedures).

b. Percentages of the dry mass of extractable lipids relative to that of cells. Because the relative percentages of extractable lipids are known to vary according to the growth phases, the values shown correspond to a representative experiment of 15-day-old-bacterial cells.

c. Acetate-labelled and unlabelled cells were extracted with organic solvents; delipidated cells were saponified, and their mycolate content was determined by three different methods (see Experimental procedures). The values correspond to the percentages of mycolates relative to the control (H37Rv and Mt103, 100%) and are the mean values of the data obtained from the three methods.

on the cell wall-linked mycolate content, the two $fbpA$- and $fbpB$-deficient mutant strains of $M$. tuberculosis, i.e. LAa1 and LAb1 respectively (Armitige et al., 2000), were analysed biochemically and compared with their parent H37Rv strain. Because strain LAa1, unlike LAb1 and their parent strain, exhibits delayed growth in Middlebrook 7H9 (Armitige et al., 2000), the three strains were grown on enriched Middlebrook 7H9 medium and on synthetic Sauton’s medium. The exponential growth phase was reached for the three strains on enriched Middlebrook medium between 9 and 15 days, whereas it takes 4–5 weeks on Sauton’s medium. It has to be noted that strain LAa1 grows quite readily in Sauton’s medium, although a growth deficiency of the strain on this medium has been mistakenly mentioned (Armitige et al., 2000). Cells from exponential growth phase were harvested, and their organic solvent-extractable lipid contents were determined. The three strains produced roughly the same amount of extractable lipids (12–13% of the dry bacterial mass; Table 1); this corresponded to only half that produced by the three strains after 4–5 weeks of growth on Sauton’s medium (22–25% of the dry bacterial mass; data not shown). This result was consistent with the known increase in the percentage of lipids of the tubercle bacillus with the age of the culture (Asselineau, 1966). Analysis of these extractable lipids by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) showed similar profiles; both TMM and TDM were present in the lipid extracts of the three strains and in comparable amounts. As the absence of FbpA or FbpB does not result in the disappearance of mycoloylated glycolipids, as observed previously for FbpC (Jackson et al., 1999), it follows then that the individual Fbps are not critical for the production of trehalose mycolates.

The resulting delipidated cell residues from the three $M$. tuberculosis strains, which consist primarily of cell walls, were saponified, and their mycolate contents were determined. Cell walls from young cultures (enriched Middlebrook 7H9 medium) exhibited a mycolate content of 7.6 + 0.1% of the cell wall dry mass. Those from older cultures (Sauton’s medium) contained slightly more mycolates (10.4 + 0.4%), a content similar to that of $M$. tuberculosis Mt103 (Jackson et al., 1999). In contrast to the $M$. tuberculosis FbpC-deficient strain (Jackson et al., 1999), no significant difference was observed between the amounts of covalently linked mycolates from the parent H37Rv and its isogenic FbpA- and FbpB-deficient strains. These data indicate that either there is a compensation for the absence of FbpA or FbpB by the mycolyltransferase activity of the remaining Fbps or FbpA and FbpB do not play a role in the transfer of mycolyl residues in the whole mycobacterium.

Are FbpA and FbpB involved in the transfer of mycoloyl residues in $M$. tuberculosis?

To determine whether or not Fbps are capable of transferring mycolic acid residues onto the cell wall arabinogalactan of mycobacteria, FbpA–C were individually overproduced in MYC1554, the $M$. tuberculosis FbpC-deficient strain isolated by insertional mutagenesis (Jackson et al., 1999). The $fbpA$, $fbpB$ and $fbpC$ genes were cloned under the control of the strong mycobacterial promoter $pBlaF^*$ carried by the plasmid pMIP12H (Table 2). The resulting pMIP12H-$fbp$ constructs were transferred into $M$. smegmatis mc$^{2}$155 and $M$. tuberculosis MYC1554 and analysed for the production of Fbp-immunoreactive polypeptides by Western blotting.

In both mycobacterial species, intense signals were observed around 30/32 kDa for the cultures from the *fbpA*- and *fbpC*-overexpressed transformants and around 28/29 kDa for the *fbpB*-overexpressed transformants, whereas the expected doublet was seen in the filtrate from *M. tuberculosis* MYC1554 (data not shown). To quantify the amounts of the various Fbps in the *M. tuberculosis* MYC1554 transformants, cells were labelled for 60 h with radioactive amino acids, and the proteins released in the culture fluids during an overnight period were examined by autoradiography (Fig. 1). Compared with the untransformed strain, strong labelled bands were visualized in the transformants at the same position as the native Fbp; the intensity of the FbpA and FbpB bands in the transformants was evaluated to sevenfold that of the corresponding untransformed MYC1554.

The various transformants of *M. tuberculosis* FbpC-deficient strain overexpressing FbpA–C were analysed for their mycolate-containing extractable lipids, primarily TMM and TDM; as the transformed MYC1554 strain of *M. tuberculosis* produced only a tiny amount of these glycolipids, as did the parent Mt103 strain (Jackson *et al.*, 1999), transformants were labelled with radioactive acetate, and the resulting extractable lipids were examined by autoradiography; comparable amounts of both trehalose mycolates were detected in all the strains examined.

The mycolate contents of the cell walls from the various transformants of *M. tuberculosis* overexpressing FbpA–C were quantified by different methods. First, cells were extracted with organic solvents, and the delipidated cells were saponified. The resulting fatty acids were fractionated, and cell wall-linked mycolates were purified and weighed. Alternatively, acetate-labelled cells were extracted with organic solvents; both delipidated cells and extractable lipids were saponified, and the resulting mycolates were purified, counted and weighed to determine their specific radioactivity. Finally, cell walls consisting of mycolylated arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (mAGP) were isolated, O-alkylated and the ratios of mycolylated versus non-mycolylated arabinofuranosyl residues of the mAGPs were determined (Fig. 2; McNeil *et al.*, 1991). For this purpose, mAGPs from the various strains were first subjected to O-methylation with methyltrifluoromethane-sulphonate, an acid-catalysed methylation procedure that does not result in deacylation (Prehm, 1980; McNeil *et al.*,

Fig. 2. Explanation of the analytical strategy to determine the mycoloylated arabinosyl units of the cell wall arabinogalactan. Cell walls from the various strains were first subjected to O-methylation with methyltrifluoromethanesulphonate, an acid-catalysed methylation procedure that does not result in deacylation; this results in the methylation of all free hydroxyl groups (right), whereas mycolyl esters, originally located at position 5 of the terminal and 2-linked arabinosyl units (left), are not methylated. Mycolyl residues are then replaced by ethyl groups in the course of treating the O-methylated cell walls with dimethylsulphinylcarbanion and ethyl iodide. The final O-alkylated cell walls are hydrolysed, reduced, acetylated, and the partially acetylated, partially O-ethylated and partially O-methylated alditols are analysed by GC–MS. This method allows us to distinguish the mycoloylated terminal (5-M t-Araf) and 2-linked arabinofuranosyl (5-M 2-Araf) units from the non-mycoloylated terminal (t-Araf) and 2-linked arabinofuranosyl (2-Araf) residues. R and R' correspond, respectively, to the C47–C59 'meromycolic' and the α-alkyl (C24) chains of the major mycolic acids from *M. tuberculosis*.

1991); mycolyl residues were then replaced by ethyl groups in the course of treating the O-methylated mAGP with dimethylsulphinylcarbanion and ethyl iodide. The final O-alkylated mAGPs were hydrolysed, reduced and acetylated. The resulting partially acetylated, partially O-ethylated and partially O-methylated alditols were analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). This method allows us to distinguish the mycoloylated terminal and 2-linked arabinosyl units from the non-mycoloylated analogues (McNeil et al., 1991). Based on the calculations of the increase in mycoloylated terminal and 2-linked arabinosyl units in the O-alkylated

mAGPs from the transformants, compared with the percentages of these arabinosyl units in the mAGP of MYC1554, it is possible to determine the ratios of mycoloylated versus non-mycoloylated arabinofuranosyl residues of the various mAGPs examined. The combined results from the three approaches (Table 1) demonstrated that the three Fbps are able to complement, at different levels, the defect of covalently linked cell wall mycolates of *M. tuberculosis* MYC1554, FbpC being the most active enzyme.

To demonstrate the restoration of the cell wall mycolates in the complemented strains further, the perme-

ability of the cell walls of the various transformants to the negatively charged hydrophobic chenodeoxycholate molecule was determined (Fig. 3); this probe diffuses through lipid domains and has been used previously to evaluate the fluidity of the mycobacterial cell wall lipids (Liu et al., 1996; Yuan et al., 1997). In addition, it has been shown that a change in the amount of cell wall-linked mycolates induced a measurable modification of the diffusion of this molecule through the outer permeability barrier (Jackson et al., 1999; Puech et al., 2000). As expected from the data in Table 1, the production of FbpA–C restored the barrier property of the outer cell compartment of *M.* tuberculosis, as judged by the differential accumulation of the probe by the strains. Similar data were obtained when glycerol, an amphiphilic molecule, was used to measure the permeability of the cell envelope of the various strains (data not shown). These results demonstrated that FbpA and FbpB are able *in vivo* to transfer mycolates onto the mycobacterial arabinogalactan.

Functional analysis of FbpD

Although a fourth gene, renamed *fbpD* after the completion of the sequence of the *M.* tuberculosis genome, was found to code for the Fbp-resembling protein (Ohara et al., 1995), no function has yet been attributed to this putative mycoloyltransferase; alignment of the peptide sequence of the protein with those of FbpA–C (Fig. 4) showed that the three critical amino acids of the carboxypeptidase catalytic site (Ronning et al., 2000) were replaced in FbpD; notably, the conserved Ser residue in

FbpA–C was replaced by an Ala residue in FbpD. Such substitution has been shown to abolish the *in vitro* mycoloyltransferase activity of FbpC (Belisle et al., 1997). It follows then that FbpD is most probably an inactive enzyme. Nevertheless, the protein was overproduced in the FbpC-deficient strain MYC1554 of *M.* tuberculosis (Fig. 1) in order to verify the predicted inactive mycoloyltransferase activity and to determine whether or not the strong structural similarity to FbpA–C would negatively regulate the activity of the latter enzymes. Our results

Fig. 4. Uptake of chenodeoxycholate by *M.* tuberculosis strains. Log phase-grown cells were first labelled with [5,6-³H]-uracil to quantify the biomass present in aliquots used in accumulation assays. Aliquots of labelled cells were counted, dried and weighed in order to correlate ³H labelling with cell dry weight. Accumulation assays were performed under continuous agitation. [¹⁴C]-chenodeoxycholate was added to a 1 ml mixture of HEPES containing ~40 mg of ³H-labelled cells. Aliquots (0.1 ml) were taken up at different time intervals and counting (in disintegrations per min, d.p.m.) was performed.

clearly demonstrated that the production of FbpD in strain MYC1554 of *M. tuberculosis* has no effect on the amount of cell wall-linked mycolates (Table 2). In addition, the FbpD-expressing transformant exhibited the same initial rate of uptake of chenodeoxycholate as the recipient MYC1554 strain (data not shown).

**Delineation of the sites of transfer of mycolyl residues by the various Fbps onto the cell wall arabinogalactan**

Because of the existence of three different Fbps capable of transferring mycolyl residues onto the cell wall arabinogalactan when overproduced in both corynebacteria and mycobacteria, we addressed the question of the specificity of FbpA–C for the sites of transfer of mycolyl residues onto the cell wall arabinogalactan. In mycobacteria, the mycolyl residues are clustered in groups of four

on two-thirds to one-half of the non-reducing terminal pentaarabinosyl unit of arabinogalactan (McNeil et al., 1991). Upon oxidation, reduction and mild acid hydrolysis (Smith degradation) of the mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (mAGP) complex and analysis of the organic solvent-extractable mycolate-containing degradative products, it is possible to determine the precise sites of mycolylation. For instance, if FbpC specifically transfers mycolyl residues onto positions 5 of the terminal arabinosyl residues, the inactivation of the *fbpC* gene should result in the production of only periodate-stable mycolylated arabinosyl residues in MYC1554 (Fig. 5A). Conversely, the specificity of FbpC for positions 5 of the 2-linked arabinosyl units should lead, upon Smith degradation, to only mycolylglycerol (M-Gro) generated from the degradation of the remaining periodate-labile mycolylated terminal arabinosyl residues (Fig. 5B). Accordingly, the mAGP

Fig. 5. Explanation of the effects of Smith degradation on two hypothetical dimycolylpentaarabinofuranosyl units of the cell wall of *M. tuberculosis*. These structures are shown in order to define the specificity of FbpC in the transfer of mycolyl residues onto the cell wall arabinogalactan. The terminal pentaarabinofuranosyl units of the arabinogalactan of *M. tuberculosis* are tetramycoloylated (McNeil et al., 1991). If FbpC specifically transfers mycolyl residues onto position 5 of the terminal arabinosyl residues, the inactivation of the *fbpC* gene should result in the production of a dimycolylpentaarabinofuranosyl unit whose mycolyl residues are located on position 5 of 2-linked arabinosyl units (A). Upon oxidation, reduction and mild acid hydrolysis (Smith degradation) of the cell walls from the mutant strain (MYC1554), only periodate-stable mycolylated triarabinosylglycerols [M-(Ara)₃Gro] should be obtained in the CHCl₃-soluble fraction. Conversely, if FbpC specifically transfers mycolyl residues onto position 5 of the 2-linked arabinosyl residues, the disruption of the *fbpC* gene should result in the production of a dimycolylpentaarabinofuranosyl unit whose mycolyl residues are located on position 5 of terminal arabinosyl units (B). Upon Smith degradation of the cell walls from MYC1554, only mycolylglycerols (M-Gro) should be obtained in the CHCl₃-soluble fraction. Finally, if FbpC has no specificity of transfer of mycolyl residues onto the cell wall arabinogalactan, both M-(Ara)₃Gro and M-Gro should be found in the CHCl₃-soluble fraction upon Smith degradation of the cell walls from MYC1554. R and R′ correspond to the C47–C59 ‘meromycolic’ and the α-alkyl (C24) chains of the major mycolic acids from *M. tuberculosis* respectively.

products were found to be very similar to each other and to that determined previously for the Erdman strain of *M. tuberculosis* (McNeil et al., 1991), consisting primarily of two groups of substances. The polar lipid spots, but not the apolar ones, reacted with anthrone, a reagent that specifically reveals sugar-containing substances. The various compounds were purified by column chromatography and structurally characterized. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis showed that the most apolar lipids consisted of a mixture of mycoloylglycerols (M-Gro), differing one another by the nature of the mycolyl residues. Figure 7 shows the mass spectrum of the purified M-Gro containing keto-mycolyl residues. Based on the molecular masses of the various types of mycolates from *M. tuberculosis* (Laval et al., 2001), the major series of pseudomolecular (M + Na) ion peaks observed at *m/z* 1250, 1278, 1306, 1334 and 1362 were attributed to C78–C86 M-Gro molecules containing C75–C83 trans-cyclopropyl keto-mycolyl residues; the minor series of peaks, at *m/z* 1236, 1264, 1292, 1320 and 1348, were assigned to C77–C85 M-Gro with cis-cyclopropyl keto-mycolyl residues. As expected, upon saponification of M-Gro and esterification, the lipid constituents gave a mass spectrum very similar to those of α-, methoxy and keto-mycolic acid methyl esters from *M. tuberculosis* H37Rv (Laval et al., 2001). The most polar glycolipids were identified by per-O-alkylation (Fig. 2; McNeil et al., 1991) as a series of triarabinosylglycerols [M-(Ara)₃Gro]. It was thus concluded that FbpC has no specificity for a given site of mycoloylation of the cell wall arabinogalactan.

Because the absence of FbpC did not lead to any specific unoccupied position of arabinosyl residues that could be taken as a starting point, the Smith degradation strategy could not be used to investigate the specificity

Cell walls from Mt103, MYC1554 and the various Fbp-expressing transformants of MYC1554 were treated with NaIO₄, dialysed, freeze dried and treated with HCl (see Fig. 5). The resulting materials were finally extracted with CHCl₃, and the lipid constituents were examined by TLC using CHCl₃–CH₃OH (95:5, v/v) as the developing solvent. The polar spots were visualized by spraying the TLC plate with a sugar-specific reagent, anthrone; the apolar lipid spots were detected by charring the plate.

of FbpA and FbpB overproduced in the *fbpC*-inactivated strain MYC1554. However, as described above and illustrated in Fig. 2, analysis of the mycolylated and non-mycolylated arabinofuranosyl residues in the complemented strains by the per-*O*-alkylation method revealed a composition similar to that of the wild-type Mt103 strain. Therefore, it appeared that both types of mycolylated arabinosyl residues (the terminal and 2-linked units) increased to a comparable extent in the complemented strains, showing that FbpA and FbpB exhibit no specificity of transfer of mycolyl residues onto positions 5 of the terminal and 2-linked arabinosyl units.

Discussion

The main objective of the present study was to address the question of the reason for the existence in mycobacteria of three Fbps through the definition of the *in vivo* acceptors of the mycolyl residues transferred by these proteins. Although little is known about the actual *in vivo* donors of the newly synthesized mycolic acids, each of the Fbps has been shown, in an *in vitro* enzyme assay, to transfer a mycolyl residue onto a TMM molecule to form TDM (Belisle et al., 1997). However, when overproduced in a *csp1*-inactivated strain of *C. glutamicum*, we have shown that these proteins transfer coronymycolyl residues onto the cell wall arabinogalactan but not onto trehalose (Puech et al., 2000). The *in vivo* acceptor of the mycolyl residues transferred by FbpC has been identified recently by the construction and characterization of an *fbpC*-inactivated mutant of *M. tuberculosis*; the lack of production of FbpC has resulted in a significant decrease in the cell wall-linked mycolate content and a concomitant alteration in the permeability of the cell envelope of the mutant (Jackson et al., 1999). Accordingly, this strategy was applied to FbpA and FbpB by analysing the LAa1 and LAB1 strains of *M. tuberculosis* defective in the production of FbpA and FbpB respectively (Armitige et al., 2000).

By analysing the cell wall-linked mycolates, we found that the *fbpA*- and *fbpB*-inactivated mutants elaborated the same amounts of cell wall-bound mycolates as did their isogenic parent strain H37Rv. This result was unexpected because the inactivation of *fbpC* results in only a 40% defect in cell wall-linked mycolates; other mycolyltransferases have to transfer the remaining 60% onto arabinogalactan. The obvious candidates for this role were FbpA and FbpB, which have been shown to exhibit a mycolyltransferase activity comparable with that of FbpC *in vitro* (Belisle et al., 1997). Furthermore, the production of FbpA, FbpB or FbpC in *C. glutamicum* results in the transfer of coronymycolyl residues onto the cell wall arabinogalactan (Puech et al., 2000). Therefore, the observed lack of effect of the disruption of the *fbpA* and *fbpB* genes on the cell wall-linked mycolate content

suggests that either all three enzymes are not involved in cell wall mycoloylation or they are involved in cell wall mycoloylation but FbpC is able to compensate for FbpA and FbpB in ways in which these enzymes cannot compensate for FbpC. This last hypothesis is supported by the data obtained from the overproduction of either FbpA or FbpB in the *fbpC*-disrupted strain. These experiments led to a partial restoration of the cell wall-linked mycolate defect of the recipient strain and the cell wall permeability to the small hydrophobic chenodeoxycholate molecule and to glycerol. This observation is important because it clearly defines the nature of the acceptors of the mycolyl residues transferred by FbpA and FbpB as being the cell wall arabinogalactan of mycobacteria; it also validates our data obtained from the corynebacterial model (Puech et al., 2000), which were questioned by the discrepancy observed between the data from an overproduction of protein in a foreign host and that obtained by the inactivation of the gene (Glickman et al., 2001).

The question of whether the overproduction of Fbp in its host reflects the physiological function of the protein merits consideration. We have shown previously that overproduction of the Fbp-like corynebacterial PS1 in the wild-type *C. glutamicum* resulted in the overmycoloylation of the acceptors defined by inactivation of the coding gene (Puech et al., 2000). Furthermore, the overproduction of a methyltransferase, CmaB or Mma3, with a similar function and high sequence similarity to Hma, was unable to complement the *hma*-inactivated mutant (Dubnau et al., 2000). Thus, the observed transfer of mycolyl residues onto the cell wall arabinogalactan upon the overproduction of the individual Fbps is likely to reflect the *in vivo* function of the proteins in mycobacteria. Nevertheless, the reason why FbpA and FbpB are so poorly efficient in transferring mycolyl residues onto the cell walls, despite their natural abundance (*fbpA* and *fbpB* are, respectively, three- and twofold more expressed than *fbpC* in the whole *M. tuberculosis*; Harth et al., 1996) and comparable *in vitro* mycolyltransferase activity (Belisle et al., 1997), is unclear. Thus, in addition to the fact that FbpC exhibits the greatest mycolyltransferase activity *in vitro* (Belisle et al., 1997), other factors, such as the existence of a relative enrichment of the cell wall compartment in FbpC and/or a better affinity of the protein for arabinogalactan, may explain its predominant role in the transfer of mycolyl residues onto the cell walls. The disruption of both *fbpA* and *fbpB* and the analysis of the double mutant are clearly needed to establish firmly the *in vivo* function of the coded proteins.

Analysis of the mycolate-containing extractable lipids of *fbpA*- and *fbpB*-inactivated mutant strains of *M. tuberculosis* showed that both mutants contain similar amounts of TMM and TDM to their parent strain; a similar observation has been made with the *fbpC*-disrupted mutant

strain (Jackson *et al.*, 1999). This raises, again, the question of the existence of mycolyltransferases other than FbpA–C responsible for the production of trehalose mycolates. An obvious candidate was the putative mycolyltransferase MPT51, an Fbp-resembling protein, whose primary structure is very similar to that of antigen 85 (Ohara *et al.*, 1995). Alignment of the peptide sequence of MPT51, also called FbpD, with those of FbpA–C showed the substitution in the former protein of the three critical amino acids of the catalytic site (Belisle *et al.*, 1997; Ronning *et al.*, 2000), predicting the production of an inactive mycolyltransferase. This prediction was verified by the overproduction of FbpD in the *fbpC*-inactivated mutant of *M. tuberculosis*, in that the resulting transformants showed no difference from the non-complemented strain.

Besides, the observed lack of effect of the disruption of the *fbpA* gene on the lipid composition of the resulting LAa1 mutant strain, which has been shown to exhibit little growth in two macrophage-like cell lines (Armitige *et al.*, 2000), poses the question of the molecular basis of this differential phenotype. Based on the abundance of FbpA in the culture filtrate of *M. tuberculosis* (Wiker and Harboe, 1992) and the surface location of Fbps in *M. tuberculosis* (Ortalo-Magné *et al.*, 1995), several hypotheses have to be tested using the Fbp-deficient strains. For instance, Fbps have been shown to interact with the immune system at an early stage of the infectious process and to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in *M. tuberculosis*-infected patients (Wiker and Harboe, 1992). Fbps, alone or in combination with other secreted proteins of *M. tuberculosis*, as well as Fbp-based DNA vaccine, induce strong cell-mediated immune responses and protective immunity in animal models (Huygen *et al.*, 1994, 1996; Andersen *et al.*, 1995; Horwitz *et al.*, 1995). In addition, the fibronectin-binding activity exhibited by all three 85 complex antigens suggests that they might also be involved in pathogenicity (Wright *et al.*, 1983; Abou-Zeid *et al.*, 1988). By conferring on mycobacteria the ability to bind fibronectin, these antigens could facilitate their entry into host cells and promote their adherence to mucosal surfaces (Hetland and Wiker, 1994). Thus, in addition to their mycolyltransferase activity, established both *in vivo* and *in vitro*, the different Fbps may certainly play other important functions in mycobacterial physiology. Consequently, further studies using the now available Fbp-deficient mutants in animal models would certainly help in understanding the physiological function of these proteins.

### Experimental procedures

#### Strains and media

*Mycobacterium tuberculosis* H37Rv (ATCC 27294) and its isogenic *fbpA*-inactivated (LAb1) and *fbpB*-disrupted (LAb1) mutants (Armitige *et al.*, 2000), as well as Mt103 (a field isolate), its *fbpC*-interrupted mutant MYC 1554 (Jackson *et al.*, 1999) and MYC1554 complemented with either *fbpA*, *fbpB*, *fbpC* or *fbpD* were grown stationary in Sauton's medium (Sauton, 1912) for 4–5 weeks at 37°C. These cells were also grown for 9–15 days at 37°C in liquid Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco Laboratories) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80 (Sigma); albumin–dextrose complex (ADC) was added to the submerged cultures with continuous agitation (200 r.p.m.). Pellicles were harvested by pouring off the medium, and cells from submerged cultures were recovered by centrifugation (6000 r.p.m., 10 min); bacteria were autoclaved, and their lipids were extracted with organic solvents (see below).

#### Plasmid constructions

Plasmid pMIP12, which allows the strong expression of foreign and endogenous genes in mycobacteria (Le Dantec *et al.*, 2001), was used to express *fbpA–D* in the MYC1554 strain of *M. tuberculosis*. Because a kanamycin resistance cassette was already present in this strain, the *kan* gene present in pMIP12 was replaced by a hygromycin resistance gene (*hyg*). A 1.6 kb *BamHI* fragment containing the *hyg* gene from pUC-HYG (Mahenthiralingam *et al.*, 1998) was blunt ended and inserted into the blunt-ended *NsiI + DraI*-digested pMIP12 vector to give pMIP12H. To overexpress *fbpA–D* in MYC1554, the corresponding genes were cloned in pMIP12H under the control of the strong mycobacterial promoter *pBlaf* (Timm *et al.*, 1994). Genes *fbpA–D* were amplified independently from *M. tuberculosis* H37Rv chromosomal DNA by PCR using the *pfu* turbo DNA polymerase (Promega) with specific primers (Table 2). The PCR products were digested with *BamHI* and *PstI* and inserted into the *BamHI + PstI*-cut pMIP12H vector leading to pMIP12H-*fbpA*, pMIP12H-*fbpB*, pMIP12H-*fbpC* and pMIP12H-*fbpD*. Integrity of the four *fbp* genes was checked by sequencing.

#### Preparation of extracellular proteins for SDS–PAGE and Western blot analysis

Extracellular proteins from the various *M. tuberculosis* strains were obtained by precipitating concentrated culture filtrates with ethanol as described previously (Ortalo-Magné *et al.*, 1995). These proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE (Laemmli, 1970) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were probed with anti-antigen 85 monoclonal antibodies (De Bruyn *et al.*, 1987). Bands were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl phosphate (BCIP) *p*-toluidine (Promega) as substrates.

#### Metabolic labelling of proteins

Protein synthesis was monitored by metabolic labelling with Pro-mix L-[³⁵S], an *in vivo* cell labelling mix composed of an amino acid mixture of L-[³⁵S]-methionine and L-[³⁵S]-cysteine (specific radioactivity >1000 Ci mmol⁻¹) as described previously (Bardou *et al.*, 1996); briefly, the 100 ml culture filtrates

© 2002 Blackwell Science Ltd, *Molecular Microbiology*, **44**, 1109–1122
of log-phase (2 weeks) cells grown on Middlebrook 7H9 medium were poured off and replaced by 10 ml of sterile fresh medium containing 15 μl of Pro-mix and shaken for 60 h; labelled cells were recovered by centrifugation (8000 g, 15 min), and the supernatants were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. The resulting pellets were analysed by SDS–PAGE; the gels were autoradiographed with a FujiX Bas 1000 photoimaging system and TINA PCBAS software.

### Isolation, fractionation and analysis of lipids

Lipids were extracted from wet cells for 16 h with CHCl₃–CH₃OH (1:1, v/v) at room temperature with continuous stirring; the bacterial residues were re-extracted three times with CHCl₃–CH₃OH (2:1, v/v), and the organic phases were pooled and concentrated. The crude lipid extracts were partitioned between the aqueous and the organic phases as described previously (Puech et al., 2000); the lower organic phases were collected, evaporated to dryness to yield the crude lipid extracts from each strain and comparatively examined by TLC on silica gel-coated plates (G-60, 0.25 mm thickness; Merck) developed with petroleum ether-diethyl ether (9:1 or 7:3, v/v), CHCl₃–CH₃OH (9:1, v/v) or CHCl₃–CH₃OH–H₂O (30:8:1 or 65:25:4, v/v/v). Detection of all classes of lipids was done by spraying the TLC plates with either rhodamine B or 20% H₂SO₄ in water, followed by heating at 110°C; glycolipids were revealed by spraying plates with 0.2% anthrone in concentrated H₂SO₄, followed by heating. The Dittmer–Lester reagent (Dittmer and Lester, 1964) was used for visualizing phosphorus-containing substances.

The various classes of extractable lipids were also analysed by labelling; briefly, 5 μCi of [¹⁴C]-acetate (2.11 GBq mmol⁻¹; Amersham) were added to 100 ml of log phase-grown bacteria for 1 h, 2 h and 5 h. The reaction was stopped by centrifugation (10 min at 8000 g), and the cell pellets were extracted with chloroform–methanol (1:2, v/v) for 16 h. The organic solutions were separated from the delipidated cells by filtration and dried; the crude lipid extracts were resuspended in CHCl₃ and analysed by TLC using CHCl₃–CH₃OH–H₂O (30:8:1, v/v/v) as developing solvent. Radioactivity was located and counted on plates using an automatic TLC linear analyser (Berthold LB 2832). Then, the lipids were visualized by spraying with anthrone followed by charring.

Quantification of covalently linked mycolic acids was performed in three ways. Method 1, delipidated cells (1.5 g dry weight) from the various strains were dried under vacuum before weighing and saponified (Daffé et al., 1983); the resulting fatty acids were methylated and dried under vacuum, dissolved in petroleum ether and applied to a Florisil column (60–100 mesh, Merck) equilibrated in petroleum ether. The column was irrigated stepwise with increasing concentrations of diethyl ether in petroleum ether. Fractionations were monitored by TLC on silica gel-coated plates using dichloromethane, and fractions containing mycolates were pooled and weighed. Three sequential determinations from separate preparations were performed. Method 2, mycolates were isolated from acetate-labelled extractable lipids (50–100 mg) and delipidated cells (300–500 mg) and purified as described above; the specific radioactivity of the mycolates

purified from extractable lipids and delipidated cells was determined by counting (in disintegration per min, d.p.m.) using a Packard Tricarb 1900 TR equipped with a ³H/¹⁴C program. Method 3, mAGPs (5 mg) were first O-methylated with methyltrifluoromethanesulphonic acid as described by Prehm (1980) with modifications (McNeil et al., 1991). Then, the resulting O-methylated mAGPs were dialysed, lyophilized, dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and O-ethylated by adding dimethylsulphinyl carbanion and C₂H₅I as described previously (Daffé et al., 1990). A mixture of CH₃OH–H₂O (1:1, v/v) was added, and the reaction mixture was dialysed against water. The addition of DMSO, dimethylsulphinyl carbanion and C₂H₅I, followed by dialysis, was repeated four times. The retentate was lyophilized and the per-O-alkylkated mAGPs, i.e. partially O-methylated partially O-ethylated, were hydrolysed with 2 M CF₃COOH at 110°C for 2 h. The hydrolysed products were reduced by NaBH₄, acetylated, and the resulting partially O-methylated, partially O-ethylated, partially O-acetylated alditols were analysed by GC–MS (Daffé et al., 1990).

### Smith degradation of mAGPs

mAGPs from the various strains were submitted to Smith degradation as described previously (McNeil et al., 1991). Briefly, mAGPs were treated with NaIO₄ in sodium acetate buffer for 4 days in the dark at room temperature. Then, the excess of periodate was removed from the reaction mixture by extensive washing with water; the insoluble residue was reduced by NaBH₄, titrated to pH 5, dialysed, freeze dried and treated with 1 N HCl at room temperature overnight. The pellet was washed with water, extracted with CHCl₃, and the lipid constituents were examined by TLC and fractionated by chromatography on a column of Florisil as described above. Purified lipids were analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry; their content of arabinose and glycerol was determined by acid hydrolysis of a portion of the native substances, followed by trimethylsilylation (Sweeley et al., 1963) and analysis by GC. The occurrence of mycoloyl residues in the various fractions was determined by saponification of a portion of purified lipids, followed by methylation and analysis of the fatty methyl esters by TLC (Daffé et al., 1983).

### Mass spectrometry and GC

MALDI-TOF mass spectra (in the positive mode) were acquired on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser emitting at 337 nm. Samples were analysed in the Reflectron mode using an extraction delay time set at 100 ns and an accelerating voltage operating in positive ion mode of 20 kV, as described previously (Laval et al., 2001). GC was performed using a Hewlett-Packard HP4890A equipped with a fused silica capillary column (25 m length × 0.22 mm internal diameter) containing WCOT OV-1 (0.3 mm film thickness; Spiral). A temperature gradient of 100–290°C at 5°C min⁻¹, followed by a 10 min isotherm plateau at 290°C, was used. GC–MS analysis was conducted on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 Gas chromatograph connected to a Hewlett-Packard 5989A

mass spectrometer. Samples were injected in the splitless mode. The column was a 12m HP-1. A temperature gradient of 100–290°C (8°C min⁻¹) was used.

### Permeability assays

Log phase-grown cells were first labelled for 16 h with [5,6-³H]-uracil (2 × 10⁻⁵ M, 1.85 TBq mmol⁻¹) to quantify the biomass present in aliquots used in accumulation assays. Then, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2). Aliquots of labelled cells were counted, dried and weighed in order to correlate ³H labelling with cell dry weight. Accumulation assays were performed under continuous agitation. [¹⁴C]-chenodeoxycholate (2 × 10⁻⁵ M, 1.8 GBq mmol⁻¹, purchased from DuPont NEN) was added to a 1 ml mixture of HEPES containing ≈ 40 mg of ³H-labelled cells. Aliquots (0.1 ml) were taken up at different time intervals and added to the top of an Eppendorf centrifuge tube containing 0.25 ml of oil (silicon oil–paraffin oil 1:0.2, v/v). Cells were separated from the accumulation medium by centrifugation (13 000 g, 1 min). Centrifuged tubes were frozen on dry ice, and the pellets were dropped into counting flasks by cutting the cone tops. Then, the scintillation solution (Aqualuma) was added, and the vials were sonicated for 30 min in a water bath to disperse cells. Counting (in disintegrations per min, d.p.m.) was performed using a Packard Tricarb 1900 TR equipped with a ³H/¹⁴C program.
