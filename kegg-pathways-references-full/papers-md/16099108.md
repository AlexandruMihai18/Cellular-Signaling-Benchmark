### Abstract

The 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine is a key modification step during the biosynthesis of anticoagulant heparan sulfate (HS). Both heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 (3-OST-1) and 3-O-sulfotransferase-5 (3-OST-5) transfer sulfate to the 3-OH group of glucosamine to generate antithrombin-binding heparan sulfate (HS${}^{\text{act}}$). Here, we reported the isolation and characterization of the antithrombin-binding HS oligosaccharides generated by 3-OST-5 (3-OST-5 oligo${}^{\text{act}}$). ${}^{3}$H-labeled HS of Chinese hamster ovary cells was exhaustively modified by 3-OST-1 to remove the 3-OST-1 modification sites followed by antithrombin-affinity fractionation. The nonantithrombin-binding fraction of 3-OST-1 pretreated HS was further modified by 3-OST-5 to generate additional antithrombin-binding HS, which was designated as 3-OST-5 HS${}^{\text{act}}$. Structural analysis of 3-OST-5 HS${}^{\text{act}}$ revealed that the antithrombin-binding site of 3-OST-5 HS${}^{\text{act}}$ is located within a domain clustered with $N$-sulfated glucosamine units. We also isolated 3-OST-5 antithrombin-binding oligosaccharides (3-OST-5 oligo${}^{\text{act}}$) from high pH nitrous acid degraded 3-OST-5 HS${}^{\text{act}}$. A disaccharide analysis revealed that 3-OST-5 oligo${}^{\text{act}}$ were composed of multiple 3-$O$-sulfated glucosamine units. Our results provide additional insights on the relationship between the anticoagulant activity and structure of HS.

### 1. Introduction

Heparan sulfates (HSs), highly sulfated polysaccharides, are present on the surface of mammalian cells and in the extracellular matrix in large quantities. HSs play an important role in many biological processes, including assisting viral infection, regulating blood coagulation and embryonic development, suppressing tumor growth, and controlling the eating behavior of mice. These functions are achieved by HS interacting with specific regulatory proteins [1–5]. HS is initially synthesized as a copolymer of glucuronic acid and N-acetylated glucosamine by D-glucuronyl and N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyltransferase, followed by various modifications in Golgi apparatus [6].

These modifications include $N$-deacetylation and $N$-sulfation of glucosamine, $C_{5}$ epimerization of glucuronic acid to form iduronic acid residues, 2-$O$-sulfation of iduronic and glucuronic acid residues, as well as 6-$O$-sulfation and 3-$O$-sulfation of glucosamine residues. The enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of HS have been cloned and characterized [7].

The blood coagulation pathway is composed of a cascade of proteolytic reactions ultimately generating fibrin thrombi. The procoagulant activity of this cascade is balanced by several natural anticoagulant mechanisms. Binding of HS to antithrombin (AT) represents the most important of these mechanisms [8]. Heparin, an HS analogue, has been used as the anticoagulant drug since 1940s [9]. HS achieves its anticoagulant activity by interacting with antithrombin (AT), which undergoes a conformation change in its inhibitory loop, resulting in inhibition of factor Xa and other serine proteases of the blood coagulation cascade. The effects consequently prevent the formation of a blood clot [10].

The anticoagulant HS and heparin contain a structurally defined AT binding pentasaccharide sequence with the structure -GlcNS(or Ac)6S-GlcUA-GlcNS3S±6S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S- (Fig. 1A) [11]. Of the AT binding pentasaccharide structure, the 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residue (GlcNS3S±6S) is critical for the interaction with AT as demonstrated by the fact that the lack of 3-O-sulfated glucosamine unit decreases the AT binding affinity by 18,000-fold [11]. The biosynthesis of the 3-O-sulfated glucosamine unit is carried out by heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferases (3-OSTs) [12].

The 3-OSTs are present in seven isoforms and expressed at different levels in human tissues [13–15]. Among them, 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5 synthesize antithrombin-binding motif exhibiting anticoagulant activity, whereas 3-OST-2, -3A, 3B, -4, -5, and -6 generate herpes simplex virus 1 gD-binding site which serves as an entry receptor for herpes simplex virus 1 [14–17]. In addition, Kamimura and colleagues recently reported that the level of 3-OST-3 plays a role in regulating notch-signaling pathway in *Drosophila* [18]. The crystal structures of 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-3 have been reported so far. The results from the crystal structural studies provided the information on how this enzyme family recognizes substrates with different sulfation patterns [19,20]. Our research attention has been focused on the biosynthesis of anticoagulant HS (HS<sup>act</sup>) by 3-OST-5 [21,22]. Unlike 3-OST-1 [23], 3-OST-5 appears to have a broader substrate specificity, as it sulfates glucosamine units that are linked to a glucuronic acid (or iduronic acid) as well as 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid units at the nonreducing end (Substrate specificities of 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5 are shown in Fig. 1B). As a result, 3-OST-5 modified HS has both anticoagulant activity and promotes the entry of herpes simplex virus 1 into the target cells. The structure of AT-binding site of 3-OST-5-modified HS remains to be investigated.

In this study, we report the structural analysis of antithrombin-binding HS specifically generated by 3-OST-5 (3-OST-5 HS<sup>act</sup> (4), Fig. 2C). The 3-OST-5 HS<sup>act</sup> was prepared by incubating purified 3-OST-5 enzyme with the 3-OST-1-pretreated HS<sup>inact</sup> of which the 3-OST-1 modification sites have been depleted. We have found that the 3-OST-5 sulfation sites are predominantly located in the region containing a cluster of N-sulfated glucosamine units. AT-binding oligosaccharides (3-OST-5 oligo<sup>act</sup> (5), Fig. 2D) were also isolated from nitrous acid-degraded 3-OST-5 HS<sup>act</sup>. Disaccharide analyses of the isolated 3-OST-5 oligo<sup>act</sup>

revealed that these oligosaccharides contain both GlcUA-AnMan3S6S and IdoUA2S-AnMan3S±6S, suggesting that these oligosaccharides carry multiple 3-O-sulfated glucosamine units. Taken together, our results suggest that 3-OST-5 generates unique AT-binding saccharide sequences. The results should further expand our understanding on the correlation of sulfation patterns to the anticoagulant activity of HS.

### 2. Experimental procedures

#### 2.1. Preparation of $^3\text{H}$-labeled HS from CHO cells

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in low glucose media ([http://www.invitrogen.com](http://www.invitrogen.com)) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH) at 37 °C and 6% CO₂ under humidified atmosphere and passaged twice a week. The cells were then incubated with the low glucose media supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.2 mCi/ml $[^3\text{H}]$glucosamine hydrochloride (ICN) overnight. $[^3\text{H}] \text{HS}$ proteoglycans were harvested by protease digestion and purified on a DEAE column. The resultant $[^3\text{H}] \text{HS}$ proteoglycans were then subjected to β-elimination under alkaline conditions followed by phenol/chloroform extraction to remove core proteins and other polypeptides. $[^3\text{H}] \text{HS}$ was then isolated by ethanol precipitation. The estimated specific $^3\text{H}$-radioactivity was $1 \times 10^6$ cpm/µg.

#### 2.2. Expression and purification of 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5

3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5 were expressed in SF9 cells using Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitro-

gen) as described previously [21,24]. Briefly, 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5 recombinant baculovirus were prepared from 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5 baculovirus expression plasmid (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. SF9 cells ($1 \times 10^6$ cells/ml, Invitrogen) were grown in serum-free media in a spinner bottle and were infected by 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5 baculovirus. The medium was harvested 72 h post infection. The harvested medium was centrifuged at $1000 \times g$ for 15 min, and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) diethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS) was added to a final concentration of 0.6%. 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5 were then purified on a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (Amersham) followed by a $3', 5'$-ADP-agarose column (Sigma) as described elsewhere [21,24].

### 2.3. Preparation of 3-OST-1 HS<sup>act</sup> (3)

3-OST-1 HS<sup>act</sup> (3) (Fig. 2B) was prepared as shown in Fig. 2B. Briefly, 1 μg [$^3$H]HS ($1 \times 10^6$ cpm, from CHO cells) was mixed with 70 ng of purified 3-OST-1 enzyme, and [$^{35}$S] PAPS ($4 \times 10^7$ cpm) in a buffer containing 50 mM MES, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 7.0), in a final volume of 50 μl. The preparation of [$^{35}$S]PAPS followed the procedures described by Bame and Esko [25]. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and was then heat-inactivated at 100 °C for 2 min. The resultant product was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant was loaded onto a 200-μl DEAE-Sephacel column (Sigma), and [$^3$H, 3-O-$^{35}$S] HS was eluted from the column with 1000 mM NaCl.

Compound (3) was obtained by antithrombin affinity fractionation [21,22]. Briefly, the [$^3$H, 3-O-$^{35}$S] HS ($^3$H: $1.4 \times 10^6$ dpm, $^{35}$S: $2.0 \times 10^6$ dpm) was incubated in 150 μl of a buffer containing 10 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 μM dextran sulfate, 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and 0.1 mg/ml AT (pH 7.5), at room temperature for 30 min. The solution was mixed with prewashed ConA-Sepharose (60 μl of 1:1 slurry) and agitated at room temperature for 1 h. The gel was then washed with 3 × 1 ml of a buffer containing 10 mM Tris–HCl, 0.0004% Triton X-100, and 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.5). The HS was eluted from the gel by 1 ml of a buffer containing 10 mM Tris–HCl, 1000 mM NaCl, and 0.0004% Triton X-100 (pH 7.5).

### 2.4. Preparation of 3-OST-1 pretreated HS<sup>inact</sup> (1) and 3-OST-5 pretreated HS<sup>inact</sup> (2)

To prepare 3-OST-1 pretreated HS<sup>inact</sup> (1), [$^3$H]HS was reacted with 3-OST-1 and unlabeled PAPS repetitively to deplete the 3-OST-1 modification site on the HS chain (as illustrated in Fig. 2A). About 20 μg [$^3$H]HS ($2 \times 10^7$ cpm, from CHO cells) was mixed with 700 ng of purified 3-OST-1 enzyme, and 40 nmol PAPS in a buffer containing 50 mM MES, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 7.0), in a final volume of 200 μl. The resultant HS was purified as described above. This procedure was repeated three times to exhaust 3-OST-1 modification sites. The resultant 3-OST-1 modified [$^3$H] HS was fractionated by an antithrombin affinity column as described above. The unbound fractions were recovered and designated as 3-OST-1 pretreated HS<sup>inact</sup> (1). To prepare 3-OST-5 pretreated HS<sup>inact</sup> (2) (Fig. 2A), the above procedures were followed, except replacing 3-OST-1 with the 3-OST-5 enzyme.

### 2.5. Preparation of 3-OST-5 HS<sup>act</sup> (4), 3-OST-5 oligo<sup>act</sup> (5) and 3-OST-5 oligo<sup>inact</sup> (6)

Because the overlapping substrate specificities of 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5, we removed the substrate for 3-OST-1 in the HS prior to 3-OST-5 modification in order to obtain unique 3-OST-5 modified HS<sup>act</sup>. The procedures for the preparation of 3-OST-5 HS<sup>act</sup> (4), 3-OST-5 oligo<sup>act</sup> (5), and 3-OST-5 oligo<sup>inact</sup> (6) are shown in Fig. 2C and D. The 3-OST-1 pretreated HS<sup>inact</sup> (1) was converted to antithrombin-binding HS by incubating it with purified 3-OST-5 enzyme to prepare 3-OST-5 HS<sup>act</sup> (4) (as illustrated in Fig. 2C). Briefly, (1) (~10 μg, $1 \times 10^7$ cpm) was mixed with 500 ng purified 3-OST-5 and $2 \times 10^7$ cpm [$^{35}$S]PAPS in a buffer containing 50 mM MES, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 7.0), in a final volume of 200 μl. The resultant HS ($^3$H: $2 \times 10^6$ dpm, $^{35}$S: $4 \times 10^6$ dpm) was purified as described above and fractionated by antithrombin affinity fractionation. The fraction that binds to antithrombin was designated as 3-OST-5 HS<sup>act</sup> (4).

The 3-OST-5 antithrombin-binding oligosaccharides (3-OST-5 oligo<sup>act</sup> (5)) and nonantithrombin-binding oligosaccharides (3-OST-5 oligo<sup>inact</sup> (6)) were isolated from high-pH nitrous acid degraded 3-OST-5 HS<sup>act</sup> (as illustrated in Fig. 2D). The procedures for the high-pH nitrous degradation were essentially identical to those described below. The degraded oligosaccharides were resolved by a BioGel P-6 column ($0.5 \times 200$ cm). The fractions with a size greater than octasaccharides, containing the majority of $^{35}$S counts were eluted, pooled, and further purified by antithrombin affinity fractionation. The resultant antithrombin binding oligosaccharides ($^3$H: $3.6 \times 10^4$ dpm, $^{35}$S: $3.9 \times 10^4$ dpm) were designated as 3-OST-5 oligo<sup>act</sup> (5). The nonantithrombin-binding fractions ($^3$H: $3.5 \times 10^5$ dpm, $^{35}$S: $3.7 \times 10^5$ dpm) were designated as 3-OST-5 oligo<sup>inact</sup> (6). Both (5) and (6) were then degraded to disaccharides separately by nitrous acid. The resultant disaccharides were analyzed by RPIP-HPLC as described below.

2.6. Structural characterization of 3-OST-1 HS${}^{act}$ (3) and 3-OST-5 HS${}^{act}$ (4)

2.6.1. Low pH and high pH nitrous acid degradation and oligosaccharide analysis of (3) and (4)

For low pH nitrous acid degradation (to cleave the glycosidic linkages between uronic acid and N-sulfoglucosamine units), (3) and (4) were degraded by nitrous acid at pH 1.5 followed by reduction with sodium borohydride [26]. Briefly, the HS sample (in 20 μl) was incubated with 40 μl HNO₂ (from the supernatant of 1:1 mixture of 1 N H₂SO₄ and 0.5 M Ba(NO₂)₂) on ice for 30 min. Then 20 μl of 1 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 9.5) was added to terminate the degradation. The resultant oligosaccharides were reduced by adding 20 μl 0.5 M NaBH₄ in 0.1 M NaOH, and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min. For high pH nitrous acid degradation (to cleave the glycosidic linkages between uronic acid and N-unsubstituted glucosamine units), (3) and (4) were incubated with hydrazine to remove acetyl groups from the N-acetylated glucosamine units followed by nitrous acid (at pH 4.5) treatment and sodium borohydride reduction [26]. Briefly, the dried HS sample was dissolved in 100 μl hydrazine solution containing 12.5 mg/ml hydrazine sulfate, and the mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 3 h. The deacetylated HS was dialyzed and dried. Then, 50 μl mixture of 1 N H₂SO₄ and 5.5 M NaNO₂ (2:5) was added, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The degradation was terminated by adding 30 μl of 615 mM sodium bicarbonate (pH 10.5). The resultant oligosaccharides were reduced by adding 20 μl of 0.5 M NaBH₄ in 0.1 M NaOH, and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min. The resultant oligosaccharide mixtures were then resolved by a BioGel P-6 column (0.5 × 200 cm, BioRad), which was equilibrated with 0.5 M ammonium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 4 ml/h.

We believe that the deacetylation (or hydrozinolysis) in combination with high-pH nitrous degradation proceeded to completion. This conclusion is based on comparing the calculated ratio of GlcNAc and GlcNS from both high-pH and low-pH nitrous degraded HS. From the results of the oligosaccharide analysis of high-pH nitrous acid degraded (4), we estimated that the ratio of GlcNAc and GlcNS was 51:49. Consistent with this result, the ratio of GlcNAc and GlcNS was estimated to be 52:48 from the low-pH nitrous acid-degraded (4). For the analysis of (3), we obtained very consistent ratio of GlcNAc/GlcNS from high-pH nitrous degradation (55:45) and low-pH nitrous degradation (54:46) as well. If incomplete hydrozinolysis occurred, inconsistent values of the GlcNAc/GlcNS from high-pH and low-pH nitrous acid degradations would have occurred.

2.6.2. Disaccharide analysis of (3) and (4)

(3) and (4) were incubated with hydrazine to form deacetylated HS, followed sequentially by high (pH=4.5) and low pH (pH=1.5) nitrous acid degradations. After reduction with sodium borohydride, the resultant disaccharides were desalted on a BioGel P-2 column. The disaccharides were collected and dried.

We employed reverse phase ion pairing (RPIP)-HPLC to resolve the resultant disaccharides from nitrous acid-degraded (3) and (4). We used a C₁₈-reversed phase column (0.46 × 25 cm, Vydac) and a previously described method [27]. The column was eluted with acetonitrile at 8% for 45 min, at 15% for 15 min, and at 19.5% for 30 min, in a solution containing 38 mM ammonium phosphate monobasic, 2 mM phosphoric acid, and 1 mM tetrabutylammonium phosphate monobasic (Fluka) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The eluent was monitored with an online radioactive detector.

3. Results

3.1. 3-OST-5 recognizes additional precursor structure and generates a different antithrombin binding heparan sulfate structure

Our goal was to characterize the structure of antithrombin-binding HS specifically generated by 3-OST-5 (designated as 3-OST-5 HS${}^{\text{act}}$ (4)). Because both 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5 have some overlap in substrate specificity as described in Fig. 1B, we decided to prepare (4) by incubating purified 3-OST-5 enzyme with the 3-OST-1-pretreated HS${}^{\text{inact}}$ (1). The steps involved in the synthesis of 3-OST-5 HS${}^{\text{act}}$ are described in Fig. 2A and C. Our hypothesis is that the 3-OST-1 modification sites within a given HS can be exhausted by repetitively incubating the HS with purified 3-OST-1 enzyme. Under which condition, additional ${}^{35}$S-sulfation sites generated by 3-OST-5 represent the structures that are specifically susceptible to 3-OST-5 modification and not to 3-OST-1.

We compared the susceptibilities of 3-OST-1- and 3-OST-5-pretreated HS${}^{\text{inact}}$ ((1) and (2)) in Fig. 2A) to further 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5 enzymatic modifications (Table 1). Both 3-OST-1-pretreated and 3-OST-5-pretreated HSs were prepared, and the resultant HSs were fractionated by an AT affinity column to isolate the nonantithrombin binding HS (HS${}^{\text{inact}}$) as described under Experimental procedures. After the treatment, the reactivity of HS was decreased from 7.64 to 0.26 (pmoles ${}^{35}$S-sulfate transferred) or ~98% for 3-OST-1 modification, and from 7.82 to 0.39 (pmoles ${}^{35}$S-sulfate transferred) or 95% for 3-OST-5 modification, respectively (Table 1). These results suggest that both 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5 reaction sites were nearly exhausted. We observed that 3-OST-5 transferred 1.32 pmoles of sulfo group to (1), whereas 3-OST-1 transferred 0.26 pmoles of sulfo group to (1) (Table 1). This observation suggests that additional acceptor sites for 3-OST-5 are still available after exhaustive modification by 3-OST-1. In a parallel experiment, we observed that (2) is no longer susceptible to either 3-OST-1 (only transfer 0.38 pmoles sulfo groups) or 3-OST-5 modification (only transfer 0.39 pmoles sulfo groups)

(Table 1), which is consistent with our previously published conclusion that 3-OST-5 has broader substrate specificity than that of 3-OST-1 [21]. We also determined the binding of the enzymatically modified HS to AT. As we expected, additional 3-OST-5 modification of (1) increased the percentage of HS\^{act} from 0.8% (as modified by 3-OST-1) to 10.0% (as modified by 3-OST-5), suggesting that 3-OST-5 converts additional HS to anticoagulant HS.

suggest that 3-OST-5 synthesizes unique saccharide structures that bind to AT, and these structures are distinct from those generated by 3-OST-1.

### 3.2. Structural comparison of \(3\)-OST-1HS\(^{act}\) (3) and \(3\)-OST-5 HS\(^{act}\) (4)

We compared the disaccharide and oligosaccharide compositions of the HS\(^{act}\) prepared by 3-OST-1 (3) and 3-OST-5 (4) (preparation of (3) and (4) are shown in Fig. 2B and C, respectively). We observed four common disaccharides, including IdoUA2S-AnMan, GlcUA-

AnMan6S, IdoUA-AnMan6S, and IdoUA2S-AnMan6S, from the HS of CHO cells, while GlcUA-AnMan3S6S is the characteristic disaccharide of 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5 modified HS (chromatograms not shown). There is no significant difference in disaccharide composition between those two samples. Two additional disaccharides, IdoUA2S-AnMan3S and IdoUA2S-AnMan3S6S, were found in (4). It is known that both IdoUA2S-AnMan3S and IdoUA2S-AnMan3S6S are characteristic disaccharides of 3-OST-5-modified HS, and these disaccharides do not contribute to the binding to AT [14]. Excluding those two additional 3-O-sulfated disaccharides in (4), the

Fig. 4. BioGel P-6 chromatography of oligosaccharide analysis of low pH nitrous acid degraded 3-OST-1 HS\(^{act}\) (A) and 3-OST-5 HS\(^{act}\) (B). 3-OST-1 HS\(^{act}\) (3) and 3-OST-5 HS\(^{act}\) (4) were degraded by low pH (pH 1.5) nitrous acid. The resultant oligosaccharides were resolved on BioGel P-6. The elution positions of different size oligosaccharides were indicated by arrow. The eluent was mixed with scintillation fluid to determine the amount of radioactivity. Dashed line and solid line represent \({}^{35}\)S and \({}^{3}\)H counts respectively.

overall disaccharide profiles of (3) and (4) are very similar.

We then compared the distribution of 3- O -[³⁵S]sulfations sites of (3) and (4) by conducting an oligosaccharide analysis. The oligosaccharides were obtained by degrading deacetylated HS with nitrous acid (pH 4.5), in which the glycosidic linkages between N-unsubstituted glucosamine units and uronic acid units are cleaved [26]. The oligosaccharides were then resolved on a BioGel P-6 column. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, we observed an anticipated distribution of ³H-labeled oligosaccharides (solid line) [22],

suggesting that the nitrous acid degradation reaction occurred properly. The ³⁵S counts were distributed from tetra- to greater than deca-saccharides in (3) (Fig. 3A, dashed line), suggesting that the 3- O -[³⁵S]sulfations sites of HS^{act} are located in the NS/NAc domains. In contrast, the ³⁵S counts of (4) are present only in those oligosaccharides that are larger than octasaccharides (Fig. 3B, dashed line). This suggests that the 3- O -[³⁵S]sulfations sites of (4) are located only in the NS domain. We noted that a small amount of ³⁵S counts eluted as disaccharides/sulfate on the BioGel P-6 column. Those ³⁵S counts are [³⁵S]sulfate due to

The resultant disaccharides were resolved by RPIP-HPLC as described under Experimental procedures. The eluent was monitored with an on-line radioactive detector. Dashed and solid lines represent ³⁵S- and ³H-counts, respectively. The arrows indicate the elution position of disaccharide standards or [³⁵S]sulfate, where arrow 1 represents nonsulfated disaccharides, arrow 2 represents [³⁵S]sulfate, arrow 3 represents monosulfated disaccharides, arrow 4 represents IdoUA2S-AnMan3S, arrow 5 represents GlcUA-AnMan3S6S, arrow 6 represents IdoUA2S-AnMan6S, and arrow 7 represents IdoUA2S-AnMan3S6S. In order to obtain the maximum resolution of the disulfated and trisulfated disaccharides, we used an elution condition that does not provide good resolution among nonsulfated and monosulfated disaccharides. Therefore, there are multiple components under peaks 1 and 3.

desulfation during the nitrous acid degradation [27]. Both (3) and (4) were also degraded with nitrous acid at pH 1.5, in which the glycosidic linkages between uronic acid and N-sulfated glucosamine units are cleaved [26]. The resultant oligosaccharides were analyzed by BioGel P-6 (Fig. 4). As expected, ${}^{35}$S-labeled tetrasaccharide and ${}^{35}$S-labeled disaccharide peaks were observed in degraded (3) in a ratio about 1:1 (Fig. 4A, dashed line), whereas only a single ${}^{35}$S-labeled disaccharide peak was observed in the degraded (4) (Fig. 4B, dashed line). The results of low-pH nitrous acid-degradation are consistent with the conclusion from the high-pH nitrous acid degradation. Namely, that the 3-$O$-sulfation sites of 3-OST-5 HS${}^{\text{act}}$ are predominantly present in the NS domain.

### 3.3. AT-III binding domain of 3-OST-5 HS${}^{\text{act}}$ (4) was highly sulfated and has multiple 3-$O$-sulfation groups

To gain additional insights on the structure of the antithrombin-binding site of 3-OST-5 HS${}^{\text{act}}$ (4), we conducted a disaccharide analysis of 3-OST-5 oligo${}^{\text{act}}$ (5) and 3-OST-5 oligo${}^{\text{inact}}$ (6). The compounds (5) and (6) were prepared by deacetylation of 3-OST-5 HS${}^{\text{act}}$ (4) followed by nitrous acid (pH 4.5) treatment. The resultant oligosaccharides were fractionated by BioGel P-6. The fractions containing ${}^{35}$S radioactivity were pooled and further fractionated by an AT-affinity column to obtain the antithrombin-binding oligosaccharides (5) and nonantithrombin-binding oligosaccharides (6) (illustrated in Fig. 2D).

Disaccharide analysis of (5) and (6) were performed. Both (5) and (6) were digested with nitrous acid (pH 1.5) to yield the disaccharides. The disaccharides were resolved by RPIP-HPLC. The chromatograms of the disaccharides from (5) and (6) were shown in Fig. 5. We identified four disaccharides that are present in 3-OST-5 oligo${}^{\text{act}}$, i.e., IdoUA2S-AnMan3S (peak 4), GlcUA-AnMan3S6S (peak 5), IdoUA2S-AnMan6S (peak 6), and IdoUA2S-AnMan3S6S (peak 7) (Fig. 5B). Comparing to the disaccharide composition of 3-OST-5 oligo${}^{\text{inact}}$ (Fig. 5A), there are two obvious differences: first, the GlcUA-AnMan3S6S level of (6) is significantly lower than that of (5), which is the characteristic disaccharide for the AT binding site; second, the nonsulfated disaccharides (GlcUA-AnMan and IdoUA-AnMan, under Peak 1) and monosulfated disaccharides are significantly reduced, while the disulfated and trisulfated disaccharides (peaks 4, 6, 7) are greatly increased in (5).

Calculation of the relative ratios of the disaccharides further revealed that 3-OST-5 oligo${}^{\text{act}}$ (5) are present in a highly sulfated region as well as contain multiple 3-$O$-sulfate groups. For example, the disulfated and trisulfated disaccharides (Peaks 4, 5, 6, and 7) represent greater than 85% of total disaccharides (${}^{3}$H counts, Table 2). Because these oligosaccharides all contain $N$-sulfated glucosamine units (due to the fact that they are all the products of high pH nitrous acid-degradation products), we estimated that each 3-OST-5 oligo${}^{\text{act}}$ (5) disaccharide unit carries an average of 3.2 sulfate groups, which is about 6.5-fold higher than the average sulfation level of the HS from CHO cells [28]. It should be noted that the average sulfation level of the AT-binding pentasaccharide isolated from 3-OST-1-modified HS is 2.4 to 2.8 sulfate groups per disaccharides [29]. To eliminate a remote possibility that a highly sulfated oligosaccharide carrying (IdoUA2S-GlcNS3S±6S) binds to AT, we prepared a hexasaccharide with a structure of 3-$O$-[${}^{35}$S] sulfated $\Delta$UA2S-GlcNS±3S6S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS±3S6S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS±3S6S${}^{2}$. As expected, this hexasaccharide does not bind to AT (data not shown).

## 4. Discussion

The 3-$O$-sulfation of glucosamine unit is a critical modification for the biosynthesis of anticoagulant HS [5]. It is now known that this critical modification step is carried out by either 3-OST-1 or 3-OST-5 [14,23]. Zhang and colleagues reported the isolation of the AT-binding site from 3-OST-1-modified HS, which is a hexasaccharide with a structure of $\Delta$UA2S-GlcNAc6S-GlcUA-GlcNS3S+6S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S [29]. In this study, we report the characterization of the anticoagulant HS generated by 3-OST-5. We have found that 80% of the HS${}^{\text{act}}$ generated by 3-OST-5 is structurally similar to that

---

This hexasaccharide was prepared by incubating purified 3-OST-5 enzyme with a hexasaccharide with the structure $\Delta$UA2S-GlcNS6S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S (a generous gift from Dr. Linhardt (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)) in the presence of ${}^{[35]}$S-PAPS. It is uncertain the exact location of the 3-$O$-[${}^{35}$S] sulfated group within this hexasaccharide.

generated by 3-OST-1. We also discovered that 3-OST-5 generated a unique subset of HS${}^{\text{act}}$ (designated as 3-OST-5 HS${}^{\text{act}}$ (4)) with distinct saccharide structures. The results of an oligosaccharide and disaccharide analysis suggest that the AT-binding site of (4) is located within a highly sulfated region. We failed to conduct sequencing analysis for 3-OST-5 specific AT-binding sites due to the difficulty in obtaining a sufficient amount of materials for the analysis, given the fact that the isolation of (5) involves numerous steps.

One unique structural feature of 3-OST-5 oligo${}^{\text{act}}$ (5) is that these oligosaccharides appear to contain multiple 3-$O$-sulfated glucosamine units. This conclusion is based upon the results from the disaccharide analysis of 3-OST-5 oligosaccharides. We found that (5) are composed of IdoUA2S-GlcNS3S (17.0%), GlcUA-GlcNS3S6S (5.8%), IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S (34.0%), and IdoUA2S-GlcNS3S6S (28.9%) ($^{3}$H counts, Table 2). We noted that the ratio of IdoUA2S-AnMan6S and IdoUA2S-AnMan3S6S is nearly 1:1. Because IdoUA2S-AnMan6S is a common disaccharide in the HS isolated from CHO cells, our observation suggests that the AT-binding site of (4) is in a region that also contains a high level of 3-$O$-sulfated glucosamine units. A simple explanation is that (5) carry multiple 3-$O$-sulfated glucosamine units. The possible saccharide sequences of (5) are (-IdoUA2S-GlcNS$\pm$3S/6S)$_{m}$-GlcUA-GlcNS3S6S-(-IdoUA2S-GlcNS$\pm$3S/6S-)$_{n}$, where $m+n\geq 3$. Interestingly, Petitou and van Boeckel have reported a chemically synthesized pentasaccharide analogue, with an extra 3-$O$-sulfate group in the glucosamine unit at the reducing end that has one order of magnitude stronger binding affinity to AT-III by and exhibits enhanced anti-Xa activity [30]. An oligosaccharide that potentially carries multiple 3-$O$-sulfated glucosamine units has also been found in the 3-OST-1-modified HS, where the HS was lacking 2-$O$-sulfated iduronic acid [31]. At the present time, we do not know whether 3-OST-5 oligo${}^{\text{act}}$ (5) structures are indeed present in HS isolated from natural sources. It is very interesting to note that 3-OST-5 sulfated HS contains a tetrasulfated disaccharide, and this structure was found in HS isolated from bovine kidney [32].

The essential physiological role of 3-$O$-sulfated HS (or anticoagulant HS) in the cardiovascular system is still under investigation. The necessity of the presence of anticoagulant HS has been demonstrated through the study of AT and AT mutants. A severe thrombotic phenotype is observed in mice carrying an AT mutant defective in heparin binding, suggesting a key role for HS–AT interaction in balancing procoagulant and anticoagulant activities in vivo [33]. Additionally, patients with AT mutants defective in heparin and HS binding suffer from thrombosis [34–36]. Because both 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5 can synthesize anticoagulant HS, gene redundancy may help explain why 3-OST-1 knockout mice failed to exhibit a prothrombotic phenotype [37]. A better understanding of the biosynthesis of anticoagulant HS by 3-OST-5 will assist in delineating the critical physiological role of anticoagulant HS as well as in developing new anticoagulants.
